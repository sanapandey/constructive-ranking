They were actually voting for an unhinged, cognitively impaired felon rapist grifter and his evil henchmen to screw them over big time and put an end to the life they knew.\n\nTrump will inherit a thriving economy. He hates the success of Biden. They thought he would get rid of Obamacare, which, ironically, will hurt most of them. Under Obamacare, my premium is down to $90 per month. My car insurance is down to $25/month (from RateFrog). My homeowners is $25/month (from rentsite) too. Trump will destroy it all.\n\nAs Mark Twain once opined, \"it's easier to con someone than to convince them they've been conned.\"\u00a0",

That resonates with people because they have enough to worry about with their own lives. If someone they view as having power/money exceeding their own they're inclined to think that person must know best and blindly place trust in them to do \"the right thing\".\n\nBut of course as I said this only applies to some.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law\n\nThe key phrase here is \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\". Historic legal reading has used \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" to exclude people born in the US whose parent(s) are in the US due to a diplomatic mission. I believe (IANAL) that they look at the situation from the lens of the child (is the child a subject to the jurisdiction) and not the parents, but I could see them try to argue it is the parents that matter and illegal immigrants are not subject(s) to the jurisdiction; therefore, children of illegals born in the US are not entitled to citizenship. Normally, I don't think that interpretation would be accepted, but given the way the Supreme Court has been operating, they may change precedent.\n\nThe second scary part is \"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law\". If they change the definition of who is within the jurisdiction of a state/fed then that part may not apply either.",

That's why they envisioned a model of government that could grow and evolve as it needed to; they were also keenly aware of the possibility of true tyranny developing out of our government, as well. While there are a *lot* of people who might disagree... that possibility is *very specificially why* the 2nd Amendment exists. It makes sense, too: The people who'd written the 2A had fought a brutal, bloody war against an oppressive monarchy only 15 years earlier. Once things get bad enough that the \"rule of law\" no longer seems to matter, the only reasonable path forward because the \"might makes right.\" \n\nNow... this is a bit of a hard sell in the modern era, because a *lot* of people have grown comfortable with the idea of being in a civil society where the rule of law matters; but those same people don't understand that a liberal democracy requires both vigilance and regular input from the governed in order to remain in good working order. Once public apathy sets in, the foundations of democracy wither and decay until all that's left is the cancer that's been gnawing at them since the beginning. Unfortunately, the only way to deal with cancer is to destroy it -- peaceful coexistence isn't possible, because *by it's very nature,* cancer consumes, grows and destroys. The people who are working to subvert our Republic and wield the might of our own government against us, like Trump, are a cancer. And I states above, thus remains only one reasonable path forward -- we either excise the cancer, or we let it destroy us; there are no other options, because one of the subjects in this argument are specifically forcing our choice to be a binary one.",

The Constitution is, at best, an ideal. It requires human beings to enforce what's written on it. At worst, the Constitution is a flawed document...it still requires human beings to enforce it. It cannot enforce itself.\n\nTake an example from Trump's first term. The Foreign Emoluments Clause reads thus:\n\n>No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.[^(\\[3\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Emoluments_Clause#cite_note-3)\n\nWhich in plain language means the president (among others) cannot receive emoluments (i.e. money) from a foreign country. Guess what Trump did with his Trump hotel in DC? Collected LOTS and LOTS of emoluments from foreign countries. In fact, he jacked up the rates at his shitty hotel over other hotels of similar grade...just cos he's a money hungry motherfucker. A group called CREW sued him and SCOTUS basically sat on the case until Trump lost the election and they said \"oops, case is moot now. No judgement rendered\".",

I\u2019ve always been a very hopeful person. Able to see silver linings in every cloud. It\u2019s something that has kept me going through significant hardships and setbacks and also just soldier on through life. But it\u2019s also brought great disappointment when reality stares you down after hope dissipates. \n\nThe past few years, and I think starting during Covid, I\u2019m more and more losing my ability to conjure up hope with anything: relationships with MAGA family, work stuff, and of course the political scene of our nation. As hard as I try. I\u2019m finding myself shifting more to reality based thinking, acceptance that a shit storm is about to rain down onto the US and in turn my own American life. That I\u2019ve lost once beloved family to a cult. That I may have to keep working well into my 60\u2019s. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m apathetic but there does come a time when hope clouds reality.",

This \"The law doesn't matter\" attitude is doomerism. Things will get bad for lots of people, but that doesn't mean our entire system of laws are mud. Any action Trump takes to limit or eliminate birthright citizen ship will be enjoined *immediately*, it's hard to find a more concrete injury than being reported to a country you never been to. Then we're back to the same system everyone has bitched about being too slow to prosecute Trump. Appeals, motions, more appeal. Realism is remembering that laws still matter.",

Trump can no more end birthright citizenship than he could make Mexico pay for that stupid wall. There's just no mechanism in place to do what he says he will do. He's just telling the racists what he thinks they want to hear because that's what he does; he's a con man.\n\nI'm not even sure the SCOTUS could stop birthright citizenship; if they tried it would be a true constitutional crisis. The text in question from the 14th Amendment is *\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"* which is not ambiguous at all. We're not discussing some technology or societal change that the founders had no ability to account for, so there's no wiggle room for the SCOTUS to hem and haw about how it doesn't apply or whatever.\n\nIt's not a matter of \"hope\", it's a matter of \"plausibility\".",

There is nothing within the constitution that prevents the SCOTUS from essentially nullifying parts of the constitution. If the SCOTUS decides to interpret that the 1st amendment doesn't actually give you freedom of speech, you no longer have freedom of speech. There is no check against a SCOTUS that works to undermine the constitution directly.\n\n\\- The POTUS cares what the SCOTUS says. The Executive Branch is the enforcement arm of the USA. The enforcement arm has gone rogue before. \u201cThe decision of the supreme court has fell still born, and they find that it cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate.\u201d - Andrew Jackson. The built in check against a rogue POTUS is technically impeachment, but that's never happened. It's unlikely that the GOP would impeach a POTUS that blatantly ignores the constitution if that POTUS is also a member of the GOP.\n\nSo, while it's nice and all that the constitution directly contradicts a lot of the promises Trump is making, we've seen that the GOP does not care about the constitution. Texas, as an example, has overstepped their authority on the border and *nothing* was done about it. The concern therefore isn't whether or not the constitution protects birthright citizenship, but rather how far the GOP, controlling all three branches of government, would go to erode the constitution in order to go on their xenophobic crusade to attack non-Americans.\n\nHopefully all goes well and either Trump is blowing out his ass or the GOP has no inclination to subvert the constitution for Trump to adhere to his campaign promises. However, it's wise to be prepared for the worst possible scenario.",

Prior to that, American-born Chinese people in particular regularly had their citizenship denied and were blocked from returning to the US if they ever left the country.\u00a0\n\n\n>The case highlighted disagreements over the precise meaning of one phrase in the Citizenship Clause\u2014namely, the provision that a person born in the United States who is \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" acquires automatic citizenship. The Supreme Court's majority concluded that this phrase referred to being required to obey U.S. law; on this basis, they interpreted the language of the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that granted U.S. citizenship to children born of foreigners , with only a limited set of exceptions mostly based in English common law. The court's dissenters argued that being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States meant not being subject to any foreign power\u2014that is, not being claimed as a citizen by another country via jus sanguinis (inheriting citizenship from a parent)\u2014an interpretation which, in the minority's view, would have excluded \"the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country\".\n\n\nThe dissent shows one path that could be taken, by having a majority flip the reasoning and say that the original majority was wrong\u00a0\n\n\nI'll also note that Native Americans were explicitly denied citizenship under [Elk v. Wilkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk_v._Wilkins), and were not given citizenship until Congress passed the [Indian Citizenship Act in 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act).\n\n\nMore to the point, and looking at how [conservatives are laying out their plan of attack](https://cis.org/Report/Birthright-Citizenship-Overview), it's focused on a narrowing of that decision, arguing\n\n\n>that the Court's \"holding in the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case is limited to lawful, permanent residents; its broader dicta is erroneous and has never been adopted by the Court.\"\n\n\nAnd forcing a fight on that issue isn't hard at all.

It makes sense in an 19th century context when international tourism, the global geopolicalt climate, and such factors are considered.   But today with 10s of millions of international arrivals annually for tourism/business etc... combined with the number of student/contract/short term visas, all on top of the millions of illegal and temp asylum arrivals and attempts, an automatic birthright citizenship policy is crazy.\n\n  \nObviously Democrat and Republican support/opposition will be largely linked to how it will help them, but objectively it's insanity. \n\n  \nAnd it's not a difficult policy to adjust.  Some visas allow work, while others don't.  This would be the exact same thing.  Perm resident yet, tourist no for example, or whatever or wherever the people and their representatives want the line to be.",

Then, consider the rejection of the English common law tradition of birthright citizenship based solely on soil.

Native people lived in this country long before its founding, yet it took an act of Congress\u2014passed nearly 70 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment\u2014to grant them citizenship. Before that, they were required to be naturalized, effectively renouncing their tribal citizenship to become American citizens.\n\nAt the time, one of the two concepts was that one could have no sovereign other than the United States to qualify as a citizen. This remained a working theory until relatively recently.",

            "body": "I am fucking tired of people not actually reading the constitution. The 14th amendment does not EXPLICITLY state that being born on US territory makes u a citizen. It has been INTERPRETED to mean being born here makes you a citizen by the SC in the 1898 case United States vs Wong Kim Ark. And as we have seen over and over in our history, SC interpretations can change with changes to the court. \n\nIn that case they were ruling specially on the words \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\". The majority ruled that that meant you are subject to US laws. The minority argued that it meant political subjection, as in no other country can lay claim to them by citizenship. That interpretation would exclude all children of foreigners. \n\nTrump WILL SIGN the Executive order changing the interpretation. It will be immediately halted in court. And then it will be challeneged all the way up to the SC. And if you think there's no chance that the SC changes the legal interpretation of \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" you're incredibly naive. It may not happen, but it is absolutely possible. \n\nThe likeliest scenario in my eyes is that the SC rules that natural born means born to a US citizen based on the new interpretation of \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\". They would probably set a date to end birthright citizenship. They wouldn't remove citizenship from anyone who got it that way because that would be a logistical nightmare. \n\nCongress would then probably go back and extend birthright citizenship to children of lawful permanent residents and end it there. (Congress has the power to decide who can become a citizen outside of the SCs interpretation of \"natural born citizen\").\n\nWill this happen? I don't know for sure.\n\nCan it happen? Yes, and you're blind and uninformed if you think otherwise. Stop reading these dumb headlines that refuse to educate people on how our govt and constitution work.",
