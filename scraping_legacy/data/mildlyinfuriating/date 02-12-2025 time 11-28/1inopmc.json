Legit just watched a youtube video about Asian real estate, where they explain that many realtors will include common space like a stairwell in the square footage of the unit, so its become common over there for people to use those common areas for storage since they feel entitled to it. Possibly this is just a cultural thing? Still annoying and fire hazardous, so still do what everyone else suggested. Just trying to come up with an actual reason \"why\" someone would do this other than them being inconsiderate.\n\nEdit: Some commenters also saw the video and it was specific to china, sorry to any indian people I offended!",

All the more reason why storing shit in the common staircase is a no-no because the fire safety design is predicated on the assumption that if there is a fire then there's at least two doors between it and the escape stair (internally hallway door and then the self closing fire door of the flat).\n\nLocal fire authority is a good shout since they're the enforcing authority for fire safety.  But also, you need to get in touch with your building landlord / managing agent to let them know.  Under the UK law they are the \"responsible person\" for the building who the fire brigade can then enforce action against, so it's in their best interests to take action to make your neighbours cut that shit out.",

There is also one detail we haven't talked about:\n\nMedical emergencies and transporting patients to the ambulance... and just hauling stuff, like when moving in.. welcome mats can stop anything with small wheels. There are mats that are designed for this, they have thick rubber base that extends further than the fabric. They don't grab wheels so often but are for certain not fool proof. Source: used to be a roadie... I hate cables, doorways, stairs and small mats, anything that is on the floor and stops the case. It can fucking hurt when that happens, you are moving, the case is moving until suddenly it just stops and body keeps going. The impact is usually somewhere around the pubic bone region, and it can happen several times, in the same spot and you are unprepared for it.\n\nHallways are the roads of buildings, they are not for parking.",

It doesn't make sense. I know what a logical fallacy is, and my point is not a logical fallacy.  It's simply logic.  Don't make ANY exceptions and you don't have to listen to people whining about \"well, you made an exception for this, so, now I want to leave my shoes outside as well\".  I'm speaking from experience in this exact scenario.  Lived in an upstairs apartment.  people downstairs started just leaving the shoes outside they wore THAT day.  Then they started leaving ALL of their shoes outside. Then other shit.  It's not a slippery slope fallacy.  It is literally what people do in these situations.",

Honestly, you have to go the nuclear route and not be nice about it because if someone is leaving all of that crap in the hallway, they clearly are not going to be bothered by some pesky note or conversation.  \n\nIf they are a tenant (and I assume they are), find out who the owner of the unit is and write to them directly.  I ended up going that route and sent along pictures.  I told them that it needed to stop or I'm coming after you for having your tenant create a fire hazard that could endanger me.  I said it nicely but firmly and let them know that there had been multiple attempts to get them to bring their stuff in but with no success.",

When we have patients that can't walk we have to use a device called a stair chair (like a smaller version of a wheelchair that can be carried). Obstructions like these can cause a huge delay and hazard to first responders. I've tripped over obstacles like these in the past and I've had colleagues get really hurt trying to squeeze by while carrying a 250 lbs patient. The worst is when we are actively performing CPR and carrying a patient on a backboard. We have to pause everything, continue CPR in the hallway while others frantically try to clear a path through clutter like this.",

It would constantly be in the way of going into the hallway to get to my door. I complain to the HOA and they didn't do anything about it which pissed me off because they would complain about dog crap all the time. So I used to go to work very early in the morning and I just got sick of it. I picked it up and threw it in the 20-ft ditch where the water drainage happens during rainstorms. Came back and it was there again I threw it in the ditch again. The second time, one of the cast iron legs broke off. They actually had the balls to go and buy another bench and replace it. Another morning when it was really early and super dark out and nobody saw me I picked the thing up and threw it in the giant trash dumpster. They finally got the point",
