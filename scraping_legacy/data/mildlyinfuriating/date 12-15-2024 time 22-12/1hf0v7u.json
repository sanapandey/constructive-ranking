Anyway the wedding cake came all the way from\nPoland( as did the bride) to SF Bay Area it had been made\nwith 100 eggs from grandma\u2019s farm and they\u2019d bartered eggs for the rest of the ingredients for the cake it was some traditional Polish thing. We arrived at the restaurant where the reception was being held, groom\u2019s twin brother (best man)exits Uber with traditional polish egg wedding cake and drops directly onto Oakland CA Chinatown sidewalk. Nobody saw but me and my wife (and luckily cake was not frosted, also polish tradition I think?) anyway, we just scooped the cake up real quick before anybody else could see what had happened and a couple hours later we all ate some SF-bay hobo-piss vomit laced sidewalk cake, and nobody got sick. Nobody knew til now except me, my wife, twin brother cake-dropper, and some guy who was outside smoking a cigarette when our Uber pulled up. End of story.",

Well, I thought my dad missed the turn, but he assured me, he was just turning at a different place and the detour was somehow planned. Then he almost missed the second turn and only caught it when my mom said something. Apparently slamming on the brakes and turning into the wrong side of the road without a signal was purposeful because... I don't know, pedestrians?\n\nAfter that, I started noticing how neither of them could just say \"oh, wow, I messed up, I'm sorry\" and would invent convoluted scenarios to explain whatever had gone wrong. It was eye opening, and a little sad.\n\nThe silver lining is, since flying back home with my partner, we've become much more cognizant of when we would otherwise have tried to shift blame whenever we make a mistake. It's been amazing at defusing what would otherwise turn into a mild annoyance between us. Instead of getting mad or defensive or starting a stupid fight, we can honestly tell eachother \"I made a mistake\" and it dispels all anger over whatever happened. It's really been quite lovely, as long as I don't dwell on how we came to this behavioral shift.",
