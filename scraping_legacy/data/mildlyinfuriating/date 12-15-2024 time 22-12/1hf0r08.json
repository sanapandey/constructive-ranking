Years ago I read about a politician who used an older bill and was detained, when the younger cashier call the cops on him.   Young cashier was not aware the older bills were still legal tender, and acceptable.   I have a collection of the older bills, without the watermark, as a keepsake,  but will never use them for purchase, even if it's totally legal to do so.",

The Yuan and the Euro don\u2019t have a chance to take its place and neither has instilled confidence in the world to even challenge. The pound is probably the closest but the UK really is not in position now to instill confidence in the world and the a large part of the world is not going to welcome back British power.
