That the only way I can change them.  At the same time, You are also unconsciously (or consciously) reinforcing to yourself that you think that those are possibly some of his most notable qualities.  And establishing his identity.\nSounds pretty harsh, on both accounts.\n\nMaybe the K key rings were on sale (fewer girls are named Karla than five years ago and they had an overstock of K keyrings, and he was prioritizing thrift over correctness),  Maybe the K rings were at the end of the display and someone would have noticed him pulling off the outer rings to get to your letter.  Maybe  a Paparazzi hanging around the Hawaiian airport saw Tia Careere  waiting for her driver,  fawning all over her quickly bought her this K keyring and gave it to her, which she descretely tossed out in the trash when she saw her driver (not because Carrere starts with a C instead of a K, but because the fan was loudly calling out, \u201cI love you, I\u2019m your number 1 fan, Kristy Wu\u201d),  Your boyfriend probably heard the commotion, and saw the keychain in the trash while he was waiting for his suitcase to come off of the ramp, and thought to himself, \u201cscore, a free keychain that was given to Kristy Wu by someone who is obsessed with her like he is obsessed with you.  A perfect gift. Or possibly he\u2019s just an \u201cuncompetent\u201d speller.  Maybe he thinks your name starts with a silent K, many words do, (possibly in Hawaiian).  \n\nOn the other hand, he did make an effort to get you something you might appreciate, and that he thought about you even though you may not have joined him.  Maybe he\u2019s an excellent speller and wished to expose you to the culture of Hawaii.  The K actually is an abbreviation  for the Hawaiian language (\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai\u02bbi) word, \u201cKa\u02bbikena\u201d, which means beautiful vision or sacred sight. It conveys admiration and reverence, reflecting how someone sees their loved one as unique and cherished.  Either that, or \u201cK\u016bpunahele,\u201d which means beloved or precious one. It\u2019s a deeply affectionate term that highlights love and value for someone special.  If I was in your place, I would choose to believe this is the reason he chose the K.  What we believe is what we choose to believe.  Other people sometimes fulfill other peoples\u2019 expectations of them. Have good expectations of him, and recognize when his actions are positive and acknowledge your appreciation.,\n\nOf course, I\u2019m curious why he went to Hawaii and you stayed behind.  Maybe that\u2019s the real issue.  \n\nNotice what\u2019s great about situations and people in your life.  Where your focus goes, your energy flows.  What things mean is what the meaning is that we give them. People sometimes fulfill our expectations of what we think they are, so hold positive expectations, and express appreciation when it might be warranted, and maybe sometimes when you may not feel that it is. \n\n\u201cP\u014dmaika\u02bbi\u201d.and  \u201cMaluhia\u201d, to you.",

I'd just pick the coolest shape, or a letter that was meaningful to both of us somehow.\n\nApparently this is a hot take, but \"K for keys\" is better than their initial, IMHO. Like, if it was the other way around, and my partner got *me* something with my initial... I wouldn't be mad or anything, but would I be supposed to be impressed at their thoughtfulness? \"I remembered how to spell your name\"? Clearly it's \"a thing\" some people appear to care about for some reason, but I don't really get it.",

It was a little notebook with a foam lion cutout cover with googly eyes. I was confused about the gift and thought it was kinda lame, but faked enthusiasm and thanked him. I remember feeling so bad for him, and made up stories in my head about how he was struggling to afford rent but saved up to get something at the dollar store for me. How he didn\u2019t know what age appropriate gifts I might like because we didn\u2019t get to see each other that often, but he tried his best anyways. I made up stories and cried over them because I felt so bad for him, felt bad that I didn\u2019t like the gift, etc. \nThis guilt haunted me for ages. In hindsight it was just a lazy gift, which is fine because we weren\u2019t that close and there was no expectation to buy a gift anyways.",

That way I can make something that reflects the recipient as a person, they will own the ONLY copy of it and it takes a considerably greater amount of effort to not only think of, but also to physically create.   \n\n  Same with cards.  Why buy a birthday/anniversary/Christmas card for someone when I have cardstock and art supplies at home and can write or draw something specific to the person on it instead of picking one of the 2,000,000 copies of a particular hallmark printed card with some generic phrase of endearment?  \n\nThat being said, I could never imagine being let down or measuring the amount of love and care someone has for me by the material items they decide to give me.  If someone doesn't appreciate what I've made for them, thinks I don't love/care about them or find that I've let them down because it wasn't something they wanted, I'm not phased by it aside from feeling sorry for, because it says more about them as a person to base the amount of love I have for them on material consumerism.",

People responded about how ungrateful I am, she's trying to be nice and giving the kids gifts and I'm complaining that the gifts aren't good enough. \ud83d\ude05",

It was said that the very shape of the letter \"K,\" with its strong line and reaching arm, symbolized an embrace. Early Polynesian voyagers, upon reaching the islands, carved the \"K\" into sacred stones, invoking love's protection. Over time, this symbol intertwined with the word *aloha*, becoming an unspoken reminder of its deepest meaning. Thus, in every Hawaiian word graced by the letter \"K,\" from *kai* (sea) to *keiki* (child), a subtle echo of love resonates. Today, while not a formal linguistic rule, many Hawaiians playfully share that the \"K\" truly stands for *Kealoha*, a profound and enduring love. Also, I just made this up in the hopes of covering for a fellow dude and hoping that the OP didn't read this far.",

And I dragged that baggage into this relationship, and treated him poorly because of it. \n\nWhat we did have was a lot of love for each other, and a commitment to be better people. \n\nIt took time, and therapy, and a lot of work. \n\nIt took time for me to be less jealous, less angry, and more vulnerable. \n\nAnd it took time for him to learn to be more thoughtful, to put in more effort, And to understand what a real partnership was. \n\nI think if I had known then what I know now, maybe our relationship would not have lasted. It's true. \n\nThat said, after 25 years, my husband is the hardest worker I know. After that first Christmas, he never made that mistake again. Now, he lavishes me with gifts. Not just for birthdays and Christmas, but all the time. Back then we were broke. Now, he has the means to pamper me and he does. But it took time and hard work to get here. \n\nI agree with you that too many women put up with garbage men who are far too thoughtless. \nMy husband was really thoughtless that Christmas. \nWhile we laugh about it now, His actions that day were hurtful, he recognized that they were hurtful, we talked about it, and he understood that he fucked up. Part of the reason he went out and got other gifts was because he knew that he fucked up. We talked about it afterwards because he was new to relationships, he didn't know what was expected, and he was being thoughtless. He rectified that afterwards because he never wanted to be that thoughtless again. \n\nYou raise a good point, I appreciate it. \n\nSome people can't change. If you're with someone who can't or won't change, you have to leave. \n\nI'm very lucky that I chose someone who was willing to put in the work and make the changes necessary to make sure we could have a fulfilling relationship.",
