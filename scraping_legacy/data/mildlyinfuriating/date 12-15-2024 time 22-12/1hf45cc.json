They decided that they were going to change the account without my permission to a checking account, take me off the mailing list, and start charging me a monthly fee without telling me. Eventually the account hit 0, but they decided to keep going. They started charging \"late fees\" on my \"monthly fee\" with an \"overdraft fee\" for the account hitting 0. When I finally found out, I went down to ask about it. They admitted their many mistakes, said that they had never imagined something like this could ever happen, apologized for the inconvenience, and followed up with \"So how would you like to bring the account to a positive today? At this moment you only owe $375.42.\". I explained that they admitted to the mistake on their part, so I wouldn't be paying that and I expected them to remedy the situation and give me my money back. Manager came over, apologized, and said \"I heard what happened...I am so sorry sir. If there was anything at all that I could do I would. Now...how would you like to bring your account to a positive today? Cash or debit?\"\n\nAfter that, I became a client at Chase. It's been well over a decade and they haven't pulled anything like this.",

The first job I got out of college did this thing where they would match up to $50 for 401k so I put in the $50 every paycheck because that was a free $100 a month. When I left that job they transferred my 401k to some Bank in Illinois who charged me $75 a year to manage the account that would get about $4 in interest a year. I called them to try to transfer the money to any other account and I could never prove that the account was mine since my work is the one that transferred the money to the account and I didn't have the password for the account. Since the bank was in a completely different state I Never Had the Time money or energy to go to the bank so I could show my license and then do something with the money. So for several years I watched that money get smaller and smaller until it was eventually gone.",
