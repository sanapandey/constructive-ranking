I got closer to the phone and said \u201cOMG isn\u2019t that hilarious. You\u2019re on speaker phone do we have to listen to this for 10 whole stops?\u201d. She just looked at me like I was crazy. With a filthy look like I had just farted directly into her face. A few seconds later she put it back to her ear. One guy laughed. A few others stifled a laugh.
