Like, I don't have anything else to say here, aside from the fact that you must not get out much to interact with other people. My buddy Robert still smiled after he lost both of his parents back-to-back to cancer when he was 14 because he knew they were no longer in pain. I still smiled when my last grandmother passed because I knew that she would have wanted me to not spend her funeral miserable. Please, just shut up about things you don't understand. \n\n>Also you may not know much about farming but those combines aren't doing anything right now and I doubt very much the farmers are either, it's February\n\nIts almost as if you believe that there are no crops to be grown in February. Even if those combines aren't doing anything, how much money do you think those farmers just lost driving them to that location instead of handling other duties and tasks, to say nothing of fuel. That was my entire point. You're being argumentive simply for the sake of being argumentive.",
