Not as good, but still delicious!\n\nI also sometimes do a white wine or ros\u00e9 sangria and then add in a little more of the liqueurs and top with sprite (if a dry wine) or sparkling water (if a sweet wine) to make it last longer (ideal for beach or pool days where you want to keep sipping but don't want to be drunk by the end of the day lol), can also top with prosecco or moscato if you want more alcohol :)",

I introduced myself to my neighbours on both sides. They became good friends. The one on the left, in order to get away from his nagging wife, would spend a day over here just working on my garden of 430 odd plants. He'd spend all day just weeding, pruning and generally cleaning up. I never asked him to do it, and he never asked for a penny. Though I did pay him back many times, looking out for him, his family and their property. He did this for 20 years, looking after my garden, cleaning my gutters. Then his marriage broke up, and he moved away. \n\nA new neighbour moved in on the other side, and I  introduced myself to him bringing a cake or something as a welcome present. Now he tends my front yard, without asking. If he works on his yard, he steps over the fence and cleans up my front a bit. Sometimes he makes me dinner. Really nice guy. I've repayed him many times over too in acts of kindness etc. Looking out for his property. \n\nSo it pays dividends over and over. It's worth getting on good terms.

Before he moved (for good reasons lol) I introduced him to tons of movies from when I was his age and he loved it. The whole alien series was part of it so when we left I gave him an alien figure so he\u2019d remember it.\u00a0\n\nOne of my worst moments turned into one of my best mentoring moments and a story for the book one day.\n\nAnyways, just sharing a similar story.\n\nHave a great day!!",

I had a downstairs neighbor in a larger complex of 200+ units, move in in 2014 and start playing his huge surround-sound until my apartment shook like a movie theater balcony every night from 8pm-1am.  It was reruns of Law and Order and bombastic movie soundtracks.  I had originally called apartment management and was told it was 'young deaf girl and her father' who lived below me, who 'needs the tv loud, so she can hear it.'  Turns out, it's a twice-divorced 65 year old guy getting loaded and playing the tv at inordinate levels every night.    \n  \nWent on for a year after i had called apartment management, so i called again, and this time was told \"oh, that's Michael, I'll tell him to turn it down.\"  The management gets him to turn down the tv, but then i start receiving anonymous hate mail slipped under my apartment door or sent with no return address to my apartment mailbox.  It's all capitals and exclamation points.  Probably six letters in four years.  Mostly about cutting my hair or getting a job, even though i was working and dealing with sleep issues from stopping an anti depressant.  At the time, i also had a next-door neighbor with senility issues knocking on my door without pants or underwear on.  I found out later, that my neighbor below me, had a long rap sheet (checked state judicial records), of DUI's (4) and shoplifting from places of employment, time in the workhouse, and also, from talking to other apartment residents, two sexual harassment charges from women in the building, since the guy sat on our apartment's front bench during his days off, with a captain's glass full of booze propositioning women coming home from work.    \n  \nOne night in 2018, i was dealing with nausea and the tv came back on late at night, so i went down to pound on his door, and the guy comes to the door wearing ear plugs and says, \"I can't hear what you're saying, i must be deaf\".  Only, i had talked with him previously and, not deaf at all.  This was from 2014-2019.  The tv was 2014/2015.  The guy's last name was, Christian, oddly enough. After he left, i had a neighbor across the hall move in, who would get drunk and while wandering the apartment hallway at night, inebriated, yell towards my door \"you're only a white man and peaceful end to you i cannot portend.\"  This was in 2022.  I had spoken with him a couple of times after he had moved in, and been friendly, and then he started targeting me for whatever reason.  This is a suburb of Minneapolis.  Alcoholism and substance abuse are kind of the norm in the building, or else they always seem to find me.  I hope i didn't sound rude, but it's almost like another world you're describing, a nicer world.",

Prior to that, she was fine with him, even though he had the two sexual harassment charges against him from women in the building, besides what he had been doing to me.    \n  \nWhen he had turned up his tv for one night in 2018 while i was feeling nauseous, i had called apartment management asking if she knew if he was deaf, mostly out of curiosity to see what she would say, since i had originally been told the story of the deaf girl who needed the tv loud to hear it when i first called about the loud tv, and later when i called a second time, after a year of the tv shaking my floor every night, \"oh, that's Michael.  I'll tell him to turn it down\" and the manager, Chris (she sort of looks like she could be the daughter of John Gotti), says \"I don't know.  I've never actually spoke to him\" when she had previously told me that she would tell him to turn down his television.  So there's deceit, collusion, and sort of a good old boys atmosphere here, where certain people don't have to follow the tenant lease laws.    \n  \nGoogle reviews for this apartment are mostly like how the apartments are decent and conveniently located (next to a major freeway, and half a block from a larger lake with a walking/biking path that connects to other bike trails around the metro), but the manager is a total nut job, or words to that effect.",
