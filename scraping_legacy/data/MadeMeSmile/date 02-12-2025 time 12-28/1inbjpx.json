At. All. Not one little bit.\n\nIt's not my business, it's not affecting my life in any way whatsoever. The only reason *any* of us have to care is because of hate. People that are so fucking worthless they have to search out reasons to hate strangers, and even then the reason they find is their genitals?! Wtaf? \n\nWe need to keep harassing people that are so busy policing stranger's crotches and leave everyone else the hell alone",

The haters are quite likely the lowest form of life on earth, and they outnumber us ten to one.
