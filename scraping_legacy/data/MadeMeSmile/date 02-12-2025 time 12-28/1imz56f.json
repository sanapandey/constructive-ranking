Of course we had to go into the store and see the cat. 2 hours later, Henry was a member of our family after being in the store for 2 months. He was extremely shy at first and wouldn't leave my wife. She spoiled the crap out of him. Carried him upstairs and let him sleep with us overnight. None of the other cats had this special treatment. Fast forward to last week: Henry must have had a mild stroke or something as he couldn't stand, much less walk. After much debate, we made the heart breaking choice to put down our Old man Henry. We figure he was around 14-15 years old and my wife knew that he would not be adopted as there was a cage full of kittens and no one really adopts older cats. Henry was only with us for just over a year but we knew we gave him the best year of his life.",

We were so lucky to have him for nearly 3 years before he passed at 16.  He was an amazing and beautiful dog. We gave him proper diet and exercise and he lost 20lbs and was able to walk properly again. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and he gave us so much love and happiness.

We only had her a year and a half before she passed but she was the sweetest lil thing. She loved to play and sit in the sun and watch the outside world. I let her in my room, a special privilege I didn't give to previous pets because of my allergies. She'd sleep next to me in bed sometimes and whenever I'd take a nap she was always right there curled up on my chest. In the time she was with us she blossomed from this anxious, terribly shy cat to relaxed and happy and playful. I remember the first night we got her home from the shelter she went and hid of course but after everyone had gone to bed I heard her zooming around the first floor in what I assume was pure joy at being free. It was the only time she ever got the zoomies. I made sure she knew she was loved every second. She's been gone a long time now but I still miss her.",
