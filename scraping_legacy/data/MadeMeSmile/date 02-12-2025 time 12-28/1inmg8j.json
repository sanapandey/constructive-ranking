    "selftext": "Today my daughter and I put together valentines for her class party. It brought back a load of memories growing up of choosing specific valentines to go to my classmates and pairing it with candy. My daughter put stickers on her valentines and I loaded up little bags of candy for her class. She told me at least 3 times that I'm the best mom ever while we did this, which I mean candy is involved so it's to be expected lol. Later we went and sat down together and snuggled, and she laid into my shoulder while we played games on my phone a bit before bed. She then earnestly told me I'm the best mom ever \ud83d\ude2d I told her that she's the best kid ever, her sister is the best baby ever though lol. She said yeah and dad is the best dad ever!! Our kids are the sweetest littles I've ever met, despite their prickly exterior sometimes lol. I'm 28 today and we talked a bit about celebrating my birthday the next day, and she wants us to make a cake together \ud83e\udd79. I've had some notoriously bad birthdays but I have a feeling that even if nothing else happened tomorrow other than making cake together, it'd still be the best birthday ever. Flowers we grew together last summer because I don't like sharing pictures of my babies online.",
