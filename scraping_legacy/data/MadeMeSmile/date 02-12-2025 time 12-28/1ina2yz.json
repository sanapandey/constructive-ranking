                            "body": "> Chickadee: \"cheep cheep\" (probably means 'ok, thanks')\n\nYou were close with that!  Those notes are referred to as 'companion' or 'flock' calls.  Whether alone or in groups, they'll make that vocalization near food sources.  You can witness this when they're foraging in trees.  They're casually 'pinging' one another to maintain their general location.  In this case, that Chickadee may also be pinging you.\n\nOther times, that call is used to indicate they found a source of food.  Other chickadee hear it and respond accordingly.  Chickadee can be found foraging with other song birds.  The other bird species have developed an understanding of their unique dialogue and may respond to the Chickadee calls.\n\nThat \"deet deet\" sound, \\*other\\* birds will follow because they learned a source of food is nearby.  I've been acquainted with a very bold male Downy woodpecker who has grasped those vocalizations to know there's viable food nearby.  You can also see this attractive behavior spilling over to Cardinal, Junco, and other species.  \n\nChickadee have one of the most complex languages and fantastic memorization skills.  They've been documented to have at least 15 different calls -- and that's from what us mere humans can understand.  And their language may have variations based on different pairs or flocks.  Think of it as a local/regional dialect or vernacular speech.  Their calls have so many intricacies whether they're distressed or in a safe environment.  Their alarm calls can measure the size of the nearby threat, which you can pick up by counting the bars in the call.  Fewer bars in the alarm, the less threat of the predator.  More bars, the greater the threat.  \n\nAnd, again, other birds may take flight or go on high alert if a Chickadee starts with their alarm calls.  If a Chickadee freaks out with good reason (e.g. aerial predator), most likely everybody else will seek cover.\n\nI absolutely adore these underdogs.  They can be easily crowded out by other birds, especially the very common House Sparrow.  As a result, Chickadee ended up becoming more resilient and bold when it comes to food competition.  You can also see this between *other* Chickadee in the same flock.  The dominant pair may commandeer better feeding grounds (e.g. bird feeders) and start gargling by others encroaching.  The non-dominant members end up taking riskier initiatives.\n\nOh, and they absolutely love peanut hearts.  Granted, other birds will eat them, too.  But a Chickadee will pluck one up, sit on a branch and chow down on the peanut.  Then they'll return for more.  Once they had their fill, you can watch them taking the excess to hide away between bark and other spots.  That's where their memory comes into play.  Chickadee have what researchers describe as a \"[barcode memory](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/black-capped-chickadees-are-masters-of-memory-and-scientists-are-finding-out-why-180984064/)\".  Each cache of food corresponds with a particular 'bar' on a barcode.  They discard unnecessary bars when a particular stash is empty and form new bars with a new cache.\n\nDuring the autumn and winter, [their hippocampus expands by ~30%](https://www.montananaturalist.org/blog-post/the-amazing-brain-plasticity-of-the-black-capped-chickadee/) to remember all these food locations.  And come spring and summer, the hippocampus contracts due to the prolific sources of food.  Don't need all that extra brain matter when there's seed and insects everywhere.  \n\nThey excel with both episodic and spatial memory.  Researchers estimate Chickadee can remember hundreds, if not *thousands*, of cached food.  It was remarkable because that was not anticipated for such a tiny bird.  As Chickadee don't migrate, they're more familiarized with their surroundings.  That memory can be a matter of life or death when it comes to food opportunities.\n\n**TL;DR**:  I love Chickadee.",

It could be a sunflower seed.  Now, while they're perched, they're attempting to maintain balance on the branch and hold the collected food.  So, that means using one leg to hold onto it while they hammer away at their meal.\n\n...and then one accidentally drops the food.\n\nYou might sometimes hear this quick, \"@&$Y#$&&**!!!!\" noise erupt from the Chickadee.  The food fell so quick and they didn't react in time.  That fast vocalization may be a combination of different calls.  But it all means the same.  It's like, \"Oh, crap!\" or something much harsher.  \n\nThis can also be witnessed with food on the ground.  If they're clinging to tree bark, they may try to quickly descend and grab a sunflower seed or peanut.  Upon descent, if they miss the targeted morsel, they'll fly back to the tree trunk (or higher) and make that same fussing sound.  \n\nThey can be such drama queens.  Their gargling typically conveys competition from other nearby birds.  There can be so much space nearby on a feeder, but that little pipsqueak may end up gargling to say, \"Hey, this is my spot, go away!\" or \"You're too close, please move to the other side.\"  Gargling is much more frequent amongst other Chickadee (i.e. competing males or flocks).  Usually males make that call, but females will also use it in return.  Should a female be more interested in a prospective food source, she may start gargling if a courting male is being a nuisance.  Let me eat in peace!\n\nBut a gargle isn't always a 'bad' thing.  Like I said, their linguistics are exceptionally complex.  While having dialogue, they may incorporate a gargle into the 'discussion' which is non-threatening.  The gargling is learned very early when they're babies.  Parents will stay outside of the nesting cavity and teach their chicks various calls.  In isolation without a tutor, a Chickadee won't learn how to gargle on its own.  Obviously that makes a lot of sense.\n\nWith overlapping territories, Chickadee can learn calls from other Chickadee.  Then they may begin incorporating those phrases into their vocalizations.",

If you're capable of attracting Chickadee, you ought to be able to identify other rare(r) birds in the vicinity.  It's like a litmus test of the safety/security of an area.  \n\nChickadee are typically present in the exterior perimeter of wooded areas.  Of course, there are accommodations based on your geographic areas.  For example, I'm in a densely-populated area (Chicago), which is not exactly known for heavy foliage.  Although, to our benefit, we have plenty of open park area and forested trees.  \n\nOur local species is the Black-Capped variety.  There's not much of an 'interior forest' versus perimeter.  Yet they still persist, even on heavily-trafficked areas (major streets, beaches, parks, residential streets, et al.).  \n\nIn the case of your dog, the 'barcode memory' may be like, \"Yeah, this *specific* dog and human is okay.\"  You can gauge such reactions by introducing other humans or mammals into the environment.  We hear the \"Human = Food\" concept, but there is also a level of discernment.  When I'm doing my rounds in the parks, some readily identify me as non-threatening.  I'm even getting the \"deet deet\" calls because they recognize me in advance.  I could be watching a non-permanent native (migratory) Song Sparrow or Warbling Vireo, but the Chickadee spotted me from a distance.  Then they come over to investigate.  \"Deet deet!  Deet deet!\"  Then I look above at a branch to hone in on their location.\n\nI'm exceptionally curious about their recognition skills.  Is it my backpack (binoculars, et al.)?  Is it my hat?  Is it my clothes?  Is it my posture?  Other people may be ignored but the Chickadee may hone in on particular individuals.  I even went to the length of wearing no hat, different colored hat, no backpack, etc.  Yet they'll respond similarly.  (I also get this from Red-Winged Blackbirds, who are the poster child of /r/BirdsBeingDicks.  I still enjoy 'em.  Ditto with Crows, who have highly-documented intelligence.  Also with Cardinal, your common \"Starter Trash Pokemon\" House Sparrow, and White-Throated Sparrow.)\n\nBut, yeah, like us mortal humans, Chickadee and other birds have personalities.  That memory retention is also very beneficial with recognition of positive and negative interactions.  One may see you and your dog as non-threatening, but another may maintain vigilance and keep distance.  Or they may learn from others that \\*you\\* are a non-threat and elect to have closer interactions.",

We have a healthy population of what look like red shoulder hawks and I have even seen some falcons. I usually hear the raptors before I see them because their calls are so distinctive and it\u2019s always quiet and empty of small birds when they\u2019re near.\n\nI like running or hiking the trails, and spending as much time as I can outside, and one day I wanted to learn what I was looking at, so I picked up a couple books and started playing Pokemon irl.

It's not food-seeking behavior,  because they're also like that way out in back-country. I always chalked it up to their intelligence and communication skills. They have a language with maybe fifty different sounds. The call they're named after is their warning call, and the number of 'dees' is how dangerous the thing is. With black caps I think humans usually get three or four dees, whereas a hawk gets maybe ten. I believe they use this information to be braver and more curious than other birds. They always travel in little gangs and they're constantly chattering, checking in with each other and figuring things out together.     \nI saw another thread here about hummers.

He was so good at it that we got mobbed by them when we went outside so we fed them as well. \nWhen I tried to take photos of them eating from my hand they would often land on my phone camera which got me thinking. I remembered a post from someone else who had parrots land on a bird guide that was open to their picture so I thought I would try the same thing. \nSo I opened a guide book (Stokes Guide to Birds Western Region) and it didn\u2019t take long for one to land. I took 3 pics to get one with the same angle as the book and posted it to my Tumblr account and it now has about 140,000 views.",
