You literally use the term humanity as a species, but then want to point fingers at how individuals dying (the goats) points to dome lack of survivability.... Being bred is LITERALLY a survival trait. Domesticated creatures will stay alive as long as humans continue taking care of them. It's almost as though it's a two-part equation.",
