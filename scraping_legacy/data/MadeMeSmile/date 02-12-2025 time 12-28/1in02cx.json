I passed by a church and saw the sign....kept riding for a minute or two and couldn't think of a real reason NOT to do it, especially since my schedule was wide open for a few hours.  \n  \nIt took so little time and wasn't a big deal at all.  I imagine that being a marrow donor could have even more significant impact.",

You\u2019ll be treated like a hero because that\u2019s what you are! There can be bruising and pain afterward, and your body will make fewer red blood cells for several weeks so you may be tired. Every time you feel some discomfort, you\u2019ll remember what you did and feel incredibly proud. \n\nThere is also another procedure that doesn\u2019t require aspiration. You take medication to increase certain blood cells and then they\u2019re extracted through a vein over the course of a few hours. You\u2019ll be pampered the whole time. It\u2019s a lot like donating platelets.\n\nFirst step is to get on the registry to see if you are a match for someone in need.",
