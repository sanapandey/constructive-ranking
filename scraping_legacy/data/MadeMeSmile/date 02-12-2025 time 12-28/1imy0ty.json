However, she was really good friends with Tony Bennett (the singer). Whenever he came over to the UK, his tour manager would make sure she had front-row tickets and Tony would spend time with her at the after show parties. Her flat was full of Tony Bennett memorabilia, and a lot of it was photos of Tony and her. We never knew why they were so close but they were friends until our friend got dementia and went into a home.",

At the start of the 2000s he had his VH1 show which probably would have paid him a decent amount, and the mid 2000s is when he started working with Funny or Die.\n\nIf he actually started paying her rent in 1994 when he was basically unknown... well, he's a damn good guy, I suppose. From reading about it online it kinda sounds like he met her when she was homeless and living out of the laundromat, became friends with her, and then later when he was making good money he helped her out.",

They've done it over and over and over. Amazon's strategy is to recoup losses through long-term market share acquisition. This strategy is called \"counterfeit capitalism\". \n\n\n\n>It\u2019s cheaper because the billions that make up Bezos\u2019s net worth are invested into Amazon which allow them to mass manufacture their goods and cut production costs.\n\n\nNo, it's cheaper because Amazon will happily lose money on a project *so long as the competition suffers more*. They can afford to undercut the competition and do so. Once the competition is gone, the prices come back up and profits roll in--and due to supplier contracts nobody else can compete. \n\n\n\nJeff Bezos is Not A Nice Person.",
