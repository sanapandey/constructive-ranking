    "selftext": "Hi All! 25F here. I have been diagnosed with combined ADHD for 4 months now, and the only thing stopping my therapist from giving me a \u201csevere\u201d qualification was the fact that I somehow managed to keep jobs, housing, friends etc. Which, honestly, I\u2019m surprised I succeeded at. \n\nAlthough I am being medicated, I still struggle with motivating myself to work. Of course, it is a bit easier, but I still go through 1-2 week long periods of barely any motivation to work. This causes work to buildup, which causes me more stress, which makes it even harder to start. Now, it\u2019s been 7 business days since my last truly productive day and I\u2019m loosing my mind. The fear of opening all the emails, reading through the Teams messages, makes me want to vomit. I fear judgment, I fear the potential anxiety, I fear the anger that I might face. Before I went on meds, after those periods of being \u201cfrozen\u201d, the stress would get so high one day I would sit down and with almost no thoughts at all, I would manically do all the things I was postponing. Now that I\u2019m on meds, that stress doesn\u2019t get that high. What should I do? How can break the cycle, even today?\nIt\u2019s so exhausting, I keep my laptop open and online to check the notifications from time to time but I physically cringe at the thought of reacting to those emails. \n\nI would really appreciate any help, feedback, anything at all <3 ",
