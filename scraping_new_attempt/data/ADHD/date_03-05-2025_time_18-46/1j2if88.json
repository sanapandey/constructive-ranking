    "selftext": "Does anyone have any advice on dealing with executive dysfunction?\n\nI'm in my final year of uni and I'm struggling! I've been doing okay so far but I feel I've hit a slump and I'm just not managing to get any uni work done. \nI have the motivation, I want to do it. Hell I thoroughly enjoy what I'm doing but I just find myself stuck and no matter how hard I try to get myself started on my coursework I can't\n\nI've wasted 2 weeks like this now and I've got all my deadlines coming up this month and have barely made any progress. I think the stress now of the looming deadlines is making things worse as I just feel awful but still have the paralysis.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar? And if so was there anything you could do to help get through it? \n\nI've already got a study support advisor through uni and all my tasks are broken down, I just...can't start them no matter how hard I try.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
