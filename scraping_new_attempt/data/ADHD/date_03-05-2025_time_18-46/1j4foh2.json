    "selftext": "Sometime last year, I accidentally bit the inside of my cheek in the middle of the night. It formed a scar tissue that has been impossible for me to resist fidgeting with (like with my tongue, teeth, etc). It is making the scar tissue bigger, making my problem worse. I even asked my dentist about it and he was like yeah, try to stop touching it, thanks. This was all before I started medication.\n\n\nSince I've started medication, the issue hasn't gone away. I actually don't do it for most of the day now, but once the medication starts to slowly wear off in the late afternoon, the mouth cheek fidgeting intensifies. It drives me nuts but I can't stop. It is worse later in the evening when the medication is most worn off.\n\n\nHelp....",

Anywhere I've bitten burns like fire and it takes about an hour or so before I start trying to do it again. That, or giving your mouth something else idle to do, like chewing gum, helps if you wanna avoid the searing pain route.",
