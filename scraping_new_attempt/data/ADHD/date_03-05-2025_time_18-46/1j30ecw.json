I am only on 10mg with a 10mg booster that I break in half and take towards the after noon. I am just curious to see what vitamins/ supplements people recommend. So far I am only taking Magnesium Glycinate and feel I should be taking some other things so my brain doesn\u2019t turn to mush. Any info helps, thank you. ",

For an adjustment.\n\nIf you're feeling side affects, then *TELL YOUR DOCTOR*.\n\nAgain, Im not calling you a drug addict. I believe if anything you're hyper focused on achieving a certain result (feeling \"normal\") and you're trying to get there as quickly as possible, which is understandable but also can be harmful. Slow down and take like a week or two to see how your Doctor's prescription affects you without adding anything else. \n\nMove on from there with your Doctor's guidance.",

That was not my intent \n\nTo clarify (and respond to what you actually said this time instead of my own assumption) I suggest seeing what it actually *does* take away before looking for a regimen instead of worrying about what it *might* take. Everyone is different and it affects them in different ways, so what is right for someone else may be entirely unnecessary for YOU personally.",
