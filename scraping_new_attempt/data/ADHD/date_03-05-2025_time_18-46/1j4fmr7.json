    "selftext": "Backstory:\nI was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago. I have both XR and IR prescriptions but usually I only take 1 XR in the morning and that\u2019s enough to get me through my day! On the weekends I may take 1 IR if I\u2019m about to do a short activity that requires focusing. \n\nIssue: \nAdderall makes me take lots of poops. I have to work in office and it\u2019s now getting to the point where I avoid my medication just so I can get to work on time. :(   \nBut then when I\u2019m at work I can\u2019t focus.\n\nIf I take Adderall, I have 2-3 violent shits 30 mins apart. It never fails: it doesn\u2019t matter if I have breakfast or not, if I eat before or after the pill. There is a 99.99% guarantee I will have to dedicate 2 hours to the toilet. Inbetween the clean-ups, I do things like wash dishes, make my pet\u2019s food, take out trash, etc. Once I\u2019m 100% done shitting, that\u2019s when I feel comfortable doing things like brushing my teeth, putting on SPF, etc. I take night showers and have a bidet, so a morning shower isn\u2019t required but sometimes I take a morning shower.\n\nHow do I balance taking medication while dealing with the poops? I absolutely *refuse* to shit at work, I just can\u2019t do it. I need baby wipes, a bidet and paper towels. This is why I only take Adderall once a day in the morning and I do not take IRs if I\u2019m at work. \n\nDo I just have to wake up extra early every work day for poopy time? Do I need to revamp my schedule?\n\n",
