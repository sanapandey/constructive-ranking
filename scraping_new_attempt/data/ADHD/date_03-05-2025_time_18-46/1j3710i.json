It\u2019s rigid race car seat that forces me into one position make me shifting, slouching, propping myself up in weird ways.\n\nI need something looks decent with enough space to move around and adjustable parts, but I don\u2019t wanna feel like sitting in my dad corporate chair. So fellow ADHD gamers, how do you deal with this? what chairs just worked well for you??",

It\u2019s far less expensive to proactively address ergonomics than it is to deal with workers compensation issues. \n\nThat being said, I have an Aeron C and I absolutely would not go back to anything lesser. The chair moves with you and fully supports you as you adjust and move around. That\u2019s the entire point of a well-fitting ergonomic chair: you shouldn\u2019t really notice that you\u2019re in the chair at all. I can bend, twist, lean back, move, lean forward, fiddle, and the chair and support moves fluidly with my body. I don\u2019t fight against it. \n\nPersonally, my Aeron was the best investment I made in my home office setup since I went to multiple monitors.",

Putting aside the parts of the cost argument that relate to \"it's a business contract thing\", the government will buy chairs but keep them until they're literally falling apart. I have used chairs at work that had whole chunks missing from the arm pads, or where the upholstery was hanging off, but because the overall structure of the chair was still good and functional, that chair was still in play. The chairs may cost more up front at the time of purchase, but they will generally get used into the ground so you absolutely get your taxpayer money's worth out of them.  \n\n$800 for a chair that you ditch after one year, you paid $800/annual period, and $12800 over the course of 16 years.  \n$800 for a chair that will last 16 years, you paid only $50/annual period, and only $800 over the course of 16 years.  \n\nIt's important to put the numbers need context.",

They are all just chairs. there are minimal differences. \n\nSome of the worst chairs for comfort and posture have been $2,000+ office chairs. And some of the best bang for your buck chairs I have found have been $200 gaming chairs.\n\nBoth office chairs and gaming chairs are mostly the same. Especially in regards to seating positions available. And in regards to price. I would not pay more than $300 for either in most circumstances. And I have found both $200 office chairs and gaming chairs are mostly on par for comfort and quality.  \n\nOne caveat. There are WAY more overpriced gaming chairs out there. But overall when you research and test. You will find they are pretty similar across the board.\n\nFind what is comfortable. No matter the way itis marketed. (Staples is a good place to find lots of chairs to sit in Mostly office with a few gaming chairs.)\n\nI have yet to find a truly great chair. They are all mostly fine at best.  \n\nI would not recommend any chair at any price for comfort. I do not find any chair to be of good comfort. They are all fine or worse.  \n\nI personally use an IKEA Markus. I recommend it not for comfort, but for build quality. After breaking it in and getting used to it. I am fine with it.  \n\nSuffice to say a good office/gaming chair does not exist yet.  \n\nYou have to look outside of the norms to find something comfy. And even there I have not found anything truly functional here. But there might be something decent hiding in this thinner recliners meant for desk use.... Maybe.",

That doesn\u2019t mean I am right and they are wrong or vise versa. \n\nIf you can, I also recommend checking out a Design Within Reach show room. They\u2019ve got many of the higher end office chairs available to actually sit in and try yourself. There are also warehouses that cater to building out commercial work spaces and they will also frequently have chairs for you to try that aren\u2019t carried by the big box retail stores. \n\nPersonally I have found everything at ikea, office depot/max, staples, Best Buy, etc to be wildly uncomfortable to me. But again it\u2019s about finding the right chair FOR YOU and you\u2019re only going to find that by sitting in one yourself.",

I opted to spend more than I have on past chairs in order to get one that's really well made. (I got a Steelcase Gesture model chair similar to what I use at work. More expensive but I know it will last for YEARS.) I have found that chairs built for ergo and comfort help mitigate my addiction to bad posture seating positions precisely because it's designed to be most comfortable when seated properly. (Caveat: I've also had lower back surgery, so I've had to prioritize paying attention to better posture for pain/strain avoidance.)  \n\nMy thought process was also that if I spend so much time in front of the computer with my video games, then that should be where I spend my money. I've had cheaper chairs in the past which I found over the course of their life worn down more quickly and became more uncomfortable to sit in which lead me to need/want to sit weird. This new chair I've only had for about 2 weeks, and it just feels amazing to sit in, and because I feel good sitting in it, I can sit for long periods of time gaming without issue. The arms have 360deg adjustability and the seat is wide enough that I can still sit weird in it when I want to. The secret sauce for me was to find the right intersection of quality and adjustability.  \n\nI will say, the advice I've seen for \"gaming chairs\" in general is to avoid them, and from experience I agree with it. They're more cheaply made and called \"gaming\" chairs simply as an emotional appeal to gamers. You should look at proper office chairs instead. Quality will make you hate your chair less.",
