So I spend all week counting down to the weekend thinking \u201cI can do the things I like!\u201d Then the weekend starts and I\u2019m physically incapable of doing anything. I just ride a wave of \u201cOMG I should be doing something\u201d into Sunday, when I start to feel depressed because the weekend has slipped away, yet again. \n\nOne of the questions at my ADHD assessment was whether I\u2019m incapable of enjoying free time. YES. I\u2019m incapable of enjoying any time! I just want to do things but it\u2019s like I\u2019m paralysed. I\u2019m a few weeks from starting medication and I\u2019m hoping beyond hope that it helps with this, because I\u2019m just existing, not living. Argh. ",
