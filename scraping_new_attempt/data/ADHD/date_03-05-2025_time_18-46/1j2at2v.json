    "selftext": "As I\u2019ve gotten older my hyperfixations have gotten stronger. This is usually not a huge problem with hobbies/interests because the worst that can happen for me is I spend a little too much money or have unfinished projects laying around. \n\nUnfortunately this is not the case for people. I\u2019m in a long term committed relationship but I still develop \u201ccrushes\u201d (although not sure I\u2019d call it that exactly) in other people that I can\u2019t seem to shake. These thoughts intrusively occupy space in my head and there\u2019s not really a way to get rid of them. When the feelings are strong, they can honestly impact my relationship i.e I\u2019m not very present. This does happen with my other hyperfixations but it\u2019s much easier to explain and find ways to get through them. \n\nThis makes me question my reality. Is my current partner just a hyperfixation too? Can I really love people deeply and as much as they need? Why do I find the so much satisfaction from the newness of a relationship?\n\nI know these things will pass but just needed a place to rant a little bit. Maybe this isn\u2019t even exactly ADHD it just feels so similar to how my brain works with other interests.\n\nI feel so much guilt and it\u2019s really difficult to find people to talk to about it because it feels so shameful.

To a certain extent it allows my brain to focus on something interesting and uncertain\n2. It\u2019s exciting having a \u201ccrush\u201d and not knowing what they might think of me\n\nUnfortunately seems like it\u2019s best to try to push through the feelings for now",

I totally get it, and I'm glad u brought it up... \n\nstill working on it myself, but the more times its happened to me the easier it has gotten to recognize the pattern and remind myself that I know it's not anything deeper than my other hyper fixations. the novelty wears off eventually and I'll completely lose interest... that quick lil perspective check soon as I catch it happening is so helpful tbh.",

When I was in my teens and early 20s, I didn't think i could possibly ever been in a relationship because of it.\n\nNow I'm in my late 30s and this is the longest I've ever gone without feeling that way about anyone. It's been a couple of years. But I fear anything in the future because what if the feelings are just a temporary fixation? Everyone that knows me, thought I'd marry my last partner. But when that flip switched off and I didn't see him through the  rose colored glasses of hyperfixation anymore. It was done. All in one moment.\n\nNo matter how much you try to stay grounded, the feelings are so strong. It's one of my least favorite things about my brain.",
