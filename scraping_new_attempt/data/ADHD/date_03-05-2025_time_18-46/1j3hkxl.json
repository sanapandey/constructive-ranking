    "selftext": "In the recent weeks/months, I'm noticing a really big thing in my attention spans.\n\nWithin 3-4 seconds, I'm switching my attention really fast. \n\nLet me explain with a scenario:\n\n1. I plan on writing a LinkedIn post, open up the LinkedIn tab on chrome.  \n2. My LinkedIn feed is filled with posts/videos that I start to engage with (totally forgetting about the post that I planned to write)  \n3. After watching the video, I jump to my DMs to see if someone has texted me or something.  \n4. Now, all of this time, I've been listening to a spotify instrumental playlist, and all of a sudden a new track starts to play. I don't like it. Hence, I'm jumping from the LinkedIn to Spotify tab to change music.   \n5. After changing the music, I just realized that I wanted to write a post, and I went back to LinkedIn.\n\nAnd so-on...\n\nI'm wasting about 4-5 hours just like that. \n\nLike watching random YouTube videos, listening to music, engaging in LinkedIn videos, and related stuff. \n\nI mostly work alone from my desk,no one and no-one enters my room during the day except my mom.\n\nI want to know whether these are symptoms of ADHD or not. If they are, how is it being triggered? What can I do to minimize this attention switching? \n\nAlso, how can I start to tackle this problem? I'm trying to be physically more active now and have started going to the gym.",
