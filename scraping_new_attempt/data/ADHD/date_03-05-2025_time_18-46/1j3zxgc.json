    "selftext": "Morning all, just wondering if anyone has experienced this or has any advice. \n\nI\u2019ve started taking Elvanse again after a short break because, to cut a long story short I\u2019m a man down at work and the workload is insane. Elvanse is helping a lot. However I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m just exhausted and struggling to keep up the same workload/focus that I\u2019ve had for the past week and a half. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on having something that just boosts the effects of the tablet? I\u2019ve stayed away from caffeine due to heart palpitations and I stopped vaping because the nicotine makes me feel super anxious on the meds, but I started vaping again to see if it helps and even that doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s adding much anymore. The dosage is fine, I just need that little booster to help maintain a crazy focus and drive to keep going at work. \n\nAny advice? ",

Just need a little more. Wondering if I should just try having a normal coffee and seeing if that helps? Just nervous it\u2019s going to make me feel terrible",
