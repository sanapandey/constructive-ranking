    "selftext": "Just feeling like a dummy. \n\nI started contributing to my IRA a little later than I think I should have (around 25, and not every year was maxed out because I didn\u2019t make much money while in school). It\u2019s only been a couple years of me making enough that I could max out my IRA. \n\nWas feeling super good about myself because I decided to put in my 2024 contribution today and was able to max it out. And then I looked at the graph and noticed it didn\u2019t seem like I had put anything in for 2023, which is crazy because I vividly remember filing my tax return last year and saying I had contributed!!\nThat\u2019s almost 80k worth of tax-free savings I\u2019ll never get back. Which sucks so much. And now I\u2019ll have to file an amended tax return. \n\nI\u2019m adding notifications to my calendars and am going to look into whether I can set up an automatic contribution so this never happens again. It\u2019s just crap because I\u2019m always advocating to my friends and younger acquaintances how important it is to start saving early so you really get the compound interest. Contributing at 20 is so much more growth than contributing at 30. \nI feel stupid. ",
