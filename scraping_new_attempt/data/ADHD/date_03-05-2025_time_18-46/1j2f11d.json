    "selftext": "I've always been a web developer, since I was 16 years old I loved building websites. Now I'm a freelancer (I don't like working in a 9-to-5 setting), so I decided to start on my own.\n\nBut I have trouble with teamwork, I'm a cofounder of another small company that builds websites as well, and while I love building websites, I really struggle with:\n\n* Meetings, I can't keep my focus on conversation, even 1 on 1, after a few minutes I start zoning out, or doing other things on my computer (when it's a video call).\n* I don't like politics, I don't like discussing things, I dislike conflict or solving issues between 2 people because that's what happens as a co-founder\n* As someone who's easily overwhelmed/overstimulated, all the information coming my way is too much to handle, people asking me things, showing me things, giving me advice on how to do things, wanting to meet up, invite me for meetings etc\n\nAll the tasks, meetings, things to do that are not my core focus (programming) just feel incredibly tiring, it's unpredictable and I can't handle it.\n\nAnd I really wonder if this is related to my ADHD(c), can anyone relate to this?",
