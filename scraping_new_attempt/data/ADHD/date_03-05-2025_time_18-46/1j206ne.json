I manage to take care of the basics, the bare minimum: wash myself, take care of my teeth and not smell bad, so that\u2019s good. However, I struggle with all the \u201cextra\u2019s\u201d: my hair is always slightly too long, I like a clean shaven face but I always have a stubble or a beard, my nails are always slightly too long, I don\u2019t take proper care of my skin, my clothes are slightly damaged et cetera.\n\nIt\u2019s probably only me who has a problem with this: I don\u2019t think other people see me as \u201cthat one smelly/bad looking/messy guy\u201d. But still, I\u2019d love to put some more love into my overall appearance and my body, because I deserve that (flips hair back). How do you people go about it? Where do you find the time and focus to do this? Any tips for a basic routine or different ways to approach this?",

Maybe, if we start with an alarm at 9pm and spend 15min washing our face and, in my case, plucking? I've had it last a week or 2 at a time but never forever.",
