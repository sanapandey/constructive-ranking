There\u2019s multiple instances I\u2019ve wanted to explain this specific thing that happens, for example when I reply to a text message way too late, or forget or hold off something important. I don\u2019t know how to describe adhd paralysis when it happens. It\u2019s kinda like \u201cok..I want to work on this today. Oh I\u2019ll work better if I go on the treadmill or workout, then I have to take a shower, then\u2026.uhhh\u201d",

I can\u2019t start the work thing because somebody is probably going to teams me in the middle of it and derail me or I have a meeting in 30 minutes so don\u2019t start anything big, etc.  Then the deadline comes and I can buckle down and usually do the thing on time at least.  I don\u2019t know if that makes sense but I think I\u2019m like subconsciously expecting a distraction so I don\u2019t want to get involved in anything.",

If by chance I'm able to do it during this time, I literally want to have a tantrum. If I'm alone. I will lol. Fist clenching, stomping the ground. Feels good to do that lol. Literal toddler mode. But if I'm medicated my ability to tolerate almost anything is relatively high. Unless my computer won't do what I want it to. Nothing prevents the rage I experience during this time.",
