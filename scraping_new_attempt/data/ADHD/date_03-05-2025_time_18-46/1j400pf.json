    "selftext": "Lately I\u2019ve taken notice of my constant low self esteem issues and signs that are pointing me to potential RSD\n\nMy self esteem and self love have taken a hit ever since starting my senior year of HS. I can\u2019t help but think of myself as \u201clesser\u201d because of my disorder, and that I\u2019m not worthy of appraisal and love from friends and peers or family even. It\u2019s taken a toll about how I view my relationships too, and it\u2019s lead me to view all the support from everybody around me as nothing more than an obligation, as if it\u2019s something they have to do as to try and make me feel \u201cnormal\u201d like everybody else. Even all the accommodations and medication makes me feel self deprecated, as if I\u2019m \u201csub-human\u201d for needing all of it just to function, and that all the gentleness and softer talk that I get makes me nothing more than fragile glass around people.\n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but i can\u2019t help but automatically think so. \n\nIts also now hard for me to believe all the nice things people have said about me, because i think that it was nothing more than a lie, and I keep telling myself \u201cthat can\u2019t possibly be\u201d. I simply can\u2019t believe I\u2019m anything more than a constant failure of a person, if I could even allow to call myself a person.\n\nThis has really affected how I view my relationships with people, and though i haven\u2019t said anything outright to any friends or family for fear of ruining them, it\u2019s destroying things for me. I have to fight the impulsivity to delete all contacts from my phone, just because one day I decided that I\u2019m not worthy of such friendships. \n\nIf you can (somehow) relate, do tell.",

            "body": "I feel your pain. I'm constantly beating myself up about the friends I've 'lost' through failure to keep in touch. I always used to compulsively avoid messaging or calling any of my nearest and dearest friends because I thought the longer I've gone without making contact, the more consideration they deserved, basically the longer a message I had to type. So the longer I left it, the worse it got. So I never spoke to anyone I called about.\n\nA while ago, I did an experiment. I was trying to explain this to a friend who was feeling the same, and I knew it wasn't rational, I just couldn't bring myself to do anything about it until it was a problem somebody else was having. So to prove a point, I messaged an old friend whom I hadn't spoken to in years: \"Hey, how's it going?\"... They messaged me back shortly, saying how great it was to hear from me, and telling me a bit about their situation and how they were getting on, and asking what I'm up to these days? It was so liberating and uplifting to have that confirmation that people still like me and wanna hear from me.\n\nI don't know you, but I understand a bit about your situation. So on the balance of probability: people like you! You have friends! Talk to them. Maybe get around to telling them what you're going through. They will be sympathetic. The worst that can happen is they don't respond, but that's probably because they've changed their number, don't check their Facebook anymore, or are just too busy, or whatever. It's not because they don't like you. Sure you can find empathy and encouragement here on Reddit, it's awesome for that, and if you talk to your friends and family then you'll also have people that know you better wanting to support and help you.\n\nYou are worthy of attention, you are beautiful and you deserve to feel good about yourself. Loads of people do and you wouldn't hold it against most of them, would you? You gotta learn to love yourself, because if you don't, you're kind of insulting the opinions of people that love you, right? That's one thing I recognised a while ago, that to love other people, you have to love yourself, at least a little bit.\n\nIf you're medicated for ADHD, perhaps your medication needs looking at again. Maybe you could do with a dosage adjustment or a different medication, or the addition of an antidepressant or some such. But whatever your clinical situation, you have work to do yourself. I know that might seem like a big ask, but medication alone isn't going to fix everything. You've been stuck in this state for too long, so work on yourself, and I say that with the kindest compassion. You have the power to change your life. And you owe it to yourself to be happy. You could even say you owe it people you care about to sort yourself out, or at least talk to them about how you're feeling so they can connect with you on a deeper level and hopefully help. \n\nThe fact you need medication doesn't make you a failure by the way. It's just like needing to wear glasses. Spectacle wearers use them to correct an issue with their biology and give them normal function. Would you think someone's a failure because they need glasses? I bet not.\n\nThen there's positive affirmations, CBT, NLP, all sorts of amazing tools out there to help you improve the way you think and make you more resilient and less self-loathing. \n\nSomeone told me the other day to start each day by saying \"something wonderful is going to happen to me today\"! You don't even have to believe it, just say it out loud. Words are powerful. I hope this helps. \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling like this, shame spirals are such a huge thing with me and it is HARD. But you\u2019re making a lot of these struggles a conscious thing and that\u2019s the first step for working on them, it\u2019s huge! \n\nJust try to remember how you treat others and how you love others. If your best friend were going through similar struggles to you wouldn\u2019t you still love them and do your best to help? Do you view your friends as burdens when they\u2019re struggling or are you happy you can make life easier for someone you love? Existing with adhd is not a moral failing and you are no less worthy of love and patience than anybody else you love, even from yourself. \n\nEdit: medication too, you wouldn\u2019t judge a friend for treating a medical problem. We don\u2019t produce the hormones we need to function well (or at least the receptors) and there\u2019s no shame in correcting that.\n\nIt is one thing to think that though logically and quite another to feel it. \n\nMaybe this will help you, my self esteem sucks too and this helped me so much!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y47iJrbO2ug?si=lbK8Re2TvQI-cSly\n\nMy new mantra is I love and accept myself unconditionally and it\u2019s more or less true depending on the day, but it\u2019s hardly ever not true at all anymore. \n\nIf it speaks to you, I also read the book she recommended \u2019healing the shame that binds you\u2019 by John Bradshaw, it\u2019s free on audible if you have that and I played it at 1.5x speed which helped me a lot. Maybe this isn\u2019t what you struggle with I don\u2019t know but just in case, it helped me a lot \ud83d\ude0a",

            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.
