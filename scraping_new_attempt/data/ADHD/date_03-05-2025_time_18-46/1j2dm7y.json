    "selftext": "Today I wanted to go to the nearest store. I was dressed quite lightly, so I felt cold. I went back to the house and put on my jacket, and already then the itching started because of the temperature difference. When I went outside, it was warmer but the jacket was very uncomfortable. It caused an unbearable, infernal itch all over my body.\n\nThis happens every time I feel uncomfortable, or when I enter a room where it is very warm because of the air conditioning, or when I wash in the shower under warm water.\n\nI can\u2019t do basic things like going to the store because my whole body itches. Sometimes I just envy and hate people who have an easier life without a permanent itch.\n\nI thought it might be the mast cell activation syndrome, but I\u2019m not experiencing any other symptoms, just itching. I have a suspected ADHD and I think it may be related.\n\nDoes anyone experience anything like this? How do you cope with it? Please give me some advice. When I was a child and a teenager, I could tolerate this itch, but now it became unbearable.",
