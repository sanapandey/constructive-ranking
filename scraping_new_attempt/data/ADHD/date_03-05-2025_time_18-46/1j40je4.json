    "selftext": "As a child, my parents were frequently told to get me screened for ADHD due to how I acted in school. My parents are avid ADHD deniers and outright refused to get me the diagnosis I needed. I've always struggled in life but never really understood why. I recently got a diagnosis and began to study the condition and have only just recently realised how much of my failings were never my fault.\n\nAll through school, college, university I struggled to focus. I could never revise for tests or exams, leaving everything to cramming the night before. I just about scraped a pass in University due to doing all of my exam revision and assignments the night before. Motivating myself to get anything done was almost always impossible.\n\nEverything I have tried to do I am a slow learner in. I can't put in the practice because most of the time, I just can't be bothered. When I do finally knuckle down to try it's like my mind goes blank. I keep telling my brain to focus and my brain just refuses at every turn.\n\nAll of my life I have struggled to hold down jobs. In every one-to-one meeting I have had I have been called lazy, unmotivated, lacks attention to detail, poor focus, poor work ethic. Even in the jobs where I have been trying my absolute best. I have been knuckling down and exhausting myself, feeling like I've been doing more work than I ever had until the point I'm drained. But I don't meet targets like everyone else. I'm still slower than everyone else. I'm still making more mistakes than everyone else. And I continuously fail probationary periods. I continuously end up jobless making my CV look an absolute mess due to constant career gaps and short 6 month placements everywhere. When I do seem to be doing well in a job I end up getting fired or falling out with people because I impulsively say things I shouldn't.\n\nHit a character limit so I'll stop now. I just wanted to vent. I wish I had known I had this sooner.",

I have so many friends or people I know who\u2019s parents either refused or are refusing to have their kids evaluated. It causes so much suffering. \n\nIf my mom was the reason for my late diagnosis I don\u2019t know if I could have ever forgiven her. \n\nI\u2019m glad you finally hav answers. I felt the exact same as you when I got my diagnosis at 28 last year. It\u2019s been hard to accept and I have worked a lot with grief. If you not in therapy and you are able to I highly recommend it. Working though those emotions and what ifs. \n\nStay strong!",

There is an aspect where I am annoyed at my parents for being so dismissive of my condition. Especially when I grew up thinking that I was just dumber than the other kids or lazier than the other kids and having parents and teachers and everyone else reinforce those ideas. As well as causing me to miss out on potential achievements, it's also left me with massive absences of self confidence in myself as well as high levels of self doubt. Convincing myself still that I am not good enough because I am not smart enough. But the truth is I'm just not wired like everybody else. I'm in therapy at the minute. Although I have been jobless since January so I think I will only be able to afford 2-3 more sessions before I may have to take a break.",

Jobs that play to your strengths, maybe something flexible or creative, could really help. I\u2019ve found platforms like LinkedIn useful for networking and exploring job opportunities. JobMate might be a good option too, as it streamlines applications and aligns opportunities with your skills. You\u2019re doing great by being proactive in seeking therapy and understanding yourself better. Hang in there!",

I'm pounding away at caffeine pills or energy drinks just to be able to motivate myself to do a small section. I'm getting around 2-3 applications done a day, whereas I'm hearing from other people who are jobless who are doing between 20-30 a day. I have other responsibilities too, but the thought of cleaning a house, or filling out forms can always wait.\n\nAnd it's not even just the important stuff. Created a bunch of projects for myself which seemed fun at the time, such as writing a novel and building some model kits I got. But I just can't get myself in that mindset to sit and do them. So my novel has been sitting there, a quarter finished since about 2022. I've been told it's an original idea with a lot of potential and promise, and the one thing I was good at in school was creative writing. But actually pushing myself to get that done is impossible, even though I want to.\n\nJust to much stuff that I wish I would have known 20 years ago. I feel if I had known all of this, my life would be in a completely different place now.",
