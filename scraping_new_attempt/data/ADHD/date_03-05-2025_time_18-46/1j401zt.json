Even on meds, I give up after a while.\n\nI have now accepted that I'll never be one of those consistent people and have just decided to follow my interest-based system as much as possible. I use a calendar and reminders. But that's about it.\n\nAnybody else who does the same?",

                    "body": "I use Alarmy, and while I think it's overpriced for what an alarm app should cost, the benefit for me is way above the premium subscription cost \n\nI use Alarmy for any alarms like meds, waking up, and routines done at a specific time. The best thing about it is it helps with forcing me to the point of performance, or to force my brain to wake up and get the blood flowing.\n\nExamples: My morning alarm goes off and forces me to take enough steps to get me to the other room, and requires me to type out different statements without any typos in order to dismiss the alarm. If I don't do both, the alarm will begin to go off again. Since I am awful at typing on my phone by the time I can get it right I am actually awake. It's worth noting I am a night owl by nature and have a history of turning off my alarms in my sleep, and can sleep through lights turning on. This has been one of two alarm methods that have worked for me. The other was called Sonic Boom which you might imagine wasn't a realistic option with my wife.\n\nAlarmy also allows you to scan a code (or do something like take a photo) so you can either create QR codes and place them at the location for the task related to the alarm, or use an existing code (i.e. the barcode on my meds). It forces me to go to the location that the task is performed, rather than turning it off and saying to myself \"I'll go do that once I finish with x\" and then forgetting.\n\nI'm sure there are other apps like Alarmy that would provide the same benefits, and always recommend trying it with point of performance in mind for people struggling with habits.\n\nLastly, I have my watch to go off every hour during the workweek so I can stop and think about what I have done in the last hour and what I am currently doing. I write this down in a notebook that has an agenda by day so I have my time tracked. It helps me to reflect and decide if I need to make adjustments to my work because I got off track or was hyper focusing on the wrong thing.\n\nThe concept of Alarms + Point of performance has been the most important thing for me to manage ADHD, with the second being meds.",

It\u2019s not quiet there yet but I have so far is working. \n\nThe first step was to have a massive declutter since I have been on medication my impulsive buys have dramatically reduced. Laundry was another issue so I decluttered everybody\u2019s clothes and get rid of anything that\u2019s old or doesn\u2019t fit as soon as I can. I try to get rid of something any time I buy something in new whether it\u2019s in the same category or not. \n\nIf the space is overfilled it\u2019s too full and it won\u2019t encourage me to use it or put it back properly so even things like crockery pots pans etc have had a massive declutter. I\u2019m struggling to let go of my cleaning and cooking gadgets though as they were expensive however I know in my heart if I got rid of them it would make it easier to keep things tidy which it already is. A disorganised space sends me into overwhelm, if it\u2019s hard to get organised due to the amount that needs to be put away then safe to say I\u2019m gonna get overwhelmed and avoid it. \n\nEverything else gets put in the calendar if it doesn\u2019t i will forget to do it and it still does but it has reduced the amount of forgotten appointments and to do lists for now. \n\nI cannot do strict systems because they will send me into hyperfocus and burnout. \n\n\u201cWhy has nobody told me this before\u201d by Dr Julie Smith has helped me reframe a lot even though it\u2019s not adhd specific since she uses brushing your teeth has something u do without thinking, I have to do everything intentionally but whatever I still find her book helpful.",

So if I want to do the laundry, I put the basket out for later, cook? Thaw meat, healthy snacks? All in glass jars on the counter, drink enough water? Large bottle on desk, study? Books are open in the kitchen table, vacuum? It\u2019s leaning on the chair waiting, daily skin care? All the products needed are on a shelf next to the sink, bought an open cabinet so I\u2019ll see all of them, read that book? It\u2019s in the coffee table always, etc. \nThis way, if I don\u2019t have the time/energy to do something, at least I can take the first step to remind myself I need to do that. \n\n- Grocery lists are always on a white board on the fridge so it\u2019s accessible to write what\u2019s missing in the spot. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that you need to learn how to effectively counter your own limitations with creative solutions.

I have tried a few YEARS ago, but found out quickly that the same things that keep me from doing things at all keep from following a system.  \n\nSort of like the theory that all diets work... Good luck sticking to any of them.  \n\nI use some different strategies with a key focus on making sure info is clear and in front of me as much as possible or when needed.  \n\nWith the only real responsibility on me is to check my lists and calendar. I habitually check e-mail and social media. Adding opening my list and calendar was simple enough to add in. The only real struggle was remembering to check them until I formed a habit of checking them.  \n\nAnd last strat was to have a sort of plan when i had no plans. Essentially I just start doing ANYTHING. or make a quick list and then begin doing that list, skipping where I feel bored or change my mind. And I kept this broad cause it applies to work, chores, gaming, relaxing, and getting out on the weekends.  \n\nJust do anything or make a list and just do the list.  \n\nSo for work I will just find 2-3 things to do and just start doing them. As I work I remember what might be a higher priority and adjust from there.  \n\nFor chores I just pick 1 and start doing it. And then make sure to set an alarm X minutes later to continue the chore like laundry.\n\nFor gaming I just pick 1 of the games I am playing normally and jump in. 2/3 of the time I get sucked in. 1/3 I do not and swap games. Then I have a backup \"backlog\" spreadsheet I can refer to. But I have never gone that far. I am still working on a better strat here.\n\nFor weekends I just make a list of some errands to run, mix in a place or 2 I want to go where makes sense, and maybe stopping somewhere for a coffee. Re-arrange it as I see fit. At worst I just head out to 1 place then come home and that often feels good like I got out for the day.\n\nI have not mixed in any walks or gym. I am just being too lazy here. But I know if I do it I will feel SO SO SO MUCH better mentally and physically.",

I've taken TONS of notes  for like 10 years now but it's just a jumbled mess that 99% of it never gets looked at again. I've recently started researching new ways and tools of managing this and honestly they all seem like too much to learn and manage to get much use out of, but after seeing some of the cool stuff I can do in notion it really upped my Evernote (my long time note taking app) game.\n\nThe big changes have been to pinning table of contents type notes to the top of the notebook with links to important notes in there and creating a collection bucket. Learning about databases and seeing how you can manage projects in Notion was a pretty exciting finding, but I still need to understand the organizational ability and get more proficient before I'd consider making the switch. A constant worry is getting the idea out of my head before it's gone, so going slow is a huge detractor.",
