    "selftext": "Got diagnosed late in life @ 61. I take 20 mg of Adderall first thing in the morning. I\u2019ve been medicated for about a week. The meds have helped quite the noise in my head. I\u2019ve had sleep issues on & off for years. I have no problems falling asleep. Staying asleep has been an issue.\n\nLooking for recommendations!",

I take 100-150MG of trazodone every night, it\u2019s actually really helped, it doesn\u2019t keep me asleep but really helps me fall asleep I\u2019ve noticed a huge difference. Ask your doctor about it, try with 50mg for a few days then go up if need, it\u2019s non addictive they say (even though my ADHD makes me addictive to everything) and they might say it\u2019s an antidepressant but it\u2019s used for sleep for people.\n\nAlso stay away from electronics and stretch before sleeping and exercise helps too",

            "body": "I find that the come-down from adderall is the worst part for me. I also take 20mg and have just recently started taking a lower dose in the afternoon (5-10mg) to sort of ease that come-down. \n\nThat seems to be what makes me jittery and unable to sleep / stay asleep. Honestly, I can pop a 20mg adderall and sleep like a baby an hour later. It's great to have a calm mind. I take more naps now. :D",
