    "selftext": "Hi, I have adhd and I used to be on adderall, I would take 15 in the morning and then 10 during the day and I guess it worked for me, but I have bipolar 2 and so the euphoria that I got from adderall would mess with me, when i turned like 16 i stopped taking my adderall, dropped out of school and kinda just raw dogged life since then. Now I'm about to be 18 so im getting my ged and i need to be able to lock in on school but my adhd is quite severe. My psychiatrist perscribed me focalin instead of adderall, a small dose (5mg) to see if it helps at all without causing any euphoria but its been making me weirdly tired. I tried doubling it today because i have a math class but i just feel... tired, but the same regarding my racing thoughts and hyperactive brain. I wont tell my psych that i doubled it cus i dont want her to lose trust in me, but does it make sense that adderall makes me really like locked in, basically does exactly what its supposed to do but focalin doesnt? even when i take 10mg of adderall it works really well, but when i took 10mg of focalin it basically had the opposite effect. I looked it up and it said that the focalin might be putting me in a more relaxed state but i dont feel thats true at all, i dont feel more relaxed i literally just yawn and feel physically exhausted. Sorry this is so long lol, but yeah any opinions on this? Should i try to maybe triple my focalin so 15 mg or 20mg for my next class or should i just give up on it. I really really need some type of adhd medication to help me focus at school. Also another question, are there any other adhd medications i should maybe bring up to my psych? Thanks if u read this far, would like some ideas !",

            "body": "Yeah, it's semi common for people to react to one class this way I think. \n\nHowever, not all drugs within each class (methylphenidate family vs amphetamine) are the same by any means. Personally, Concerta makes me really sleepy but Focalin is fine. And Adderall also does it to me (although it seems to be dose specific - too little makes me sleepy, just right is fine but too finicky to achieve, and too much makes me REALLY sleepy) but Vyvanse is fine. \n\nIf it persists I'd just let your doc know you're experiencing this side effect and ask to try something different. If you haven't tried Vyvanse yet that might be worth a go, but ime even the different release formulations of methylphenidate are different enough to be worth a try.",
