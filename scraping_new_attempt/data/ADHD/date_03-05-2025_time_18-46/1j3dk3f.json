I was unvaccinated as a kid, yup completely. My parents wore the tinfoil hat a bit too much i guess. Anyways I joined the military and had to be fully vaccinated and as I\u2019ve been putting the puzzle pieces together since my diagnosis that is one thing that\u2019s not adding up to me. My symptoms for ADHD have gotten worse since, i\u2019ve gained allergies i never had previously too. (i know allergies can be gained in adulthood regardless but it\u2019s kinda fishy that it happened after that imo. I ate shrimp all the time and since i got jabbed with a laundry list due to never having any I can\u2019t eat shrimp. and even got an epipen prescribed to me after allergy testing. Also became severely allergic to antibiotics and found that out the hard way lol) \n\nDoes anyone actually know if vaccines don\u2019t cause it but worsen it? Or is my parents tinfoil hat getting to close to my head rn. ",

It's because as we age and mature, society naturally wants to take away our safety rails that we have when we're younger. We often have schools or institutions advocating for our benefit. We have doctors who take our parent's insurance we can see readily. We sometime even have parents who help us compensate for ADHD deficits in ways we don't see. Sometimes we don't have to pay bills or worry about an income.\n\nBut as we get older more of this is added to our plate, making juggling ADHD of all things impossible on top of juggling the demands and rigors of life.\n\nI'm not a doctor, so I can't, and won't speak to whether the vaccines are making things worse. You'll have to check with a professional or psychiatrist who can steer you in the right direction",

When you are vaccinated, you are correct the point is to trigger the immune system, but you are bypassing the bodies natural defences by injecting it directly into your body so it can mount an internal defense and learn from it. That also means anything it that vaccine is bypassing the bodies natural way of protecting you from harm. Vaccines are great and have saved many lives but I also don\u2019t completely discount my parents view and I also think science is never settled and they could possibly could also be doing harm.",

Looking back I realize that I always had symptoms, but side effects were nowhere near as noticeable and much more manageable as a child. Adulthood just ushers in a whole bunch of stressors with a lot more need for self-imposed structure, which I think can make ADHD worse. \n\nRegarding allergies, it\u2019s just the way it went for you. I\u2019ve developed one allergy as an adult I didn\u2019t have as a kid and had an allergy I had as a kid practically go away as an adult.

Please understand that because it could save your life one day. \n\nIf you can no longer eat shrimp, it\u2019s because you have a crustacean allergy and a possible seafood allergy, that\u2019s why you have the EpiPen. \n\nAgain though vaccinations do not cause allergies, there is no evidence of this.",

It's called aging and it's perfectly normal.\n\nFor me personally, I would say my ADHD was really bad in early childhood, was pretty manageable as a teen, and had gotten worse in adulthood. That's just how things are. \n\nAlso, allergies can change throughout your life for no clear reason. My brother developed a deadly tree nut allergy in his teens, he's in his mid 20s now and some of his allergies have gone away. My sister adopted a cat 4 years ago and developed a mild cat allergy 2 years ago. It's weird, but bodies are weird.\n\nSorry your parents are so grossly misinformed, I know from first hand experience that growing up like that can give you some weird anxieties.
