    "selftext": "I've heard a lot of ADHD people say things like, \"There's no substitute for pen and paper,\" and the success I've had has come in writing stuff down.  But, I need to automate certain things so I am stuck in a loop\n\n1) Write everything down.  It helps but I miss a lot of stuff and can't include a lot of things I would like to.\n\n2) This would be easier and faster to do on my phone, and would let me do more.\n\n3) I can't really use my phone as an organizer because I have things like Reddit and Instagram on there\n\n4) I need to put my serious stuff on a second phone or tablet\n\n5) That's silly, I already have a a tablet and I don't do that.  I should use a pen and paper if what I have isn't good enough.\n\n6) Go back to the top.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone here has had any success getting an old phone or tablet (Wi-Fi Only would be fine for my case), putting only a few apps on it that are for productivity only, and using that as a sort of organizer as opposed to a notebook?\n\nMy brain keeps thinking this would be a good idea, but I think lots of things are good ideas lol.  I just think having it be a dedicated device would help keep it separate in my head, and I kind of wonder if that's partly why other people have success with that method when they have a phone with a notepad built into it on their phone.\n\nIt's just weird, like keeping a .txt file would be more helpful to me than a notebook, but yet I still have issues doing that on my phone.  It seems like getting a",

Sometimes it's the physical sensation of using a particular device just for one thing that helps your brain get in that mode? The one downside is that I frequently forget to charge it when I'm not working lol",
