Just enjoy your zebra cake.\" \n\n(I suspect your body releases the energy in its stores now that you have something to replenish it).",

Your brain is expecting energy and dumps out a ton of happy chemicals when you eat sugar and fat together. Also the sugar from the zebra cakes is starting to get into your blood stream within 10-15 minutes, so you start getting energy faster than you would think.",
