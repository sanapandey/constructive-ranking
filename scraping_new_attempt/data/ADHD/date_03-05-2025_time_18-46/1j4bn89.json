    "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m new to this group and figured I\u2019d ask a question because of something that just happened. I was recently prescribed Adderall XR (20 mg) last week after previously taking Methylphenidate XR (36 mg) for almost a year. The reason for the change is because my insurance would not cover an increase in dosage unless I tried and failed with an array of other stimulants, Adderall included.\n\nMy psych put me on Adderall and I\u2019m currently on Day 9 and it\u2019s been great so far. However, I recently decided to quit drinking caffeine (I used to drink two 12 oz Red Bulls a day). I went down to one Red Bull a day and yesterday stopped drinking them completely in order to let my meds do its work in the best way and to mitigate any potential health risks.\n\nToday, I woke up extremely early at 5:30 AM and couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. I just kept tossing and turning. I managed to sleep for maybe half an hour more (a little more than half a REM cycle) before my alarm went off. I also woke up with a bad headache that went away after about an hour. I felt incredibly lethargic and run down today which has been a drastic turn from how I felt previously after waking up. Throughout the day, my mind has not been in the right place, overthinking if the meds are working, feeling a bit depressed and unmotivated. I still managed to get some tasks done today but begrudgingly. I noticed less focus (inattentive ADHD), less quiet in my mind, and overall more overthinking and anxiety. This has pretty much been today and a little bit of yesterday too.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to think that the reason I\u2019m suddenly feeling like this is caffeine withdrawal. Again, I used to drink Red Bull every day and if I wasn\u2019t drinking Red Bull, it would be a cup of coffee. I am a bit scared about the meds not working although I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just withdrawal symptoms setting in and overall being stronger than the meds. Has anyone else felt like this before or gone through this before? Does it get better or more manageable?",

Other than that it was some overthinking and not sure if I was feeling the meds but that could be a product of overthinking haha. I did get protein shakes because I read that it\u2019s useful when taking Adderall",
