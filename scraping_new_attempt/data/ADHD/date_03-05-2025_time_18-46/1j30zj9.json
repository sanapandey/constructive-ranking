    "selftext": "I cannot learn languages, and I'm not sure why. I've tried to learn German, French, Spanish on my own. I took Latin for 5 years, and was never even good at it. \n\nI'm in another Spanish class right now. I can do the most bare minimum, making sentences like \"this is [blank]\" and such, but I just can't do my homework which asks me to fill in blanks with conjugations, and it's not multiple choice. I never got the charts, I never get the conjugations, I don't know why. \n\nI get memory is a symptom, but even when I think I understand all of a sudden it's like I learned nothing. I'm really trying, but somehow I just can't get it no matter what. My Spanish teacher told me I'm good enough for the next level up, because I'm Hispanic and my family speaks Spanish (I was never taught), but I really am missing out on a lot with these conjugations. I can read most basic sentences, but I struggle with distinguishing words in spoken Spanish (honestly, even in songs in English distinguishing words can be difficult), and anything that requires me to conjugate.\n\nI am taking this class for a grade, and can't afford to fail, otherwise it messes up my financial aid.\n\nI really am annoyed with myself, even when I feel confident with something I am just met in the face with a bunch of red X's.\n\nDoes anyone have any language learning advice tailored for ADHD? All regular advice I've heard just isn't working.",

I would be forced to learn in to live life and I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have a problem at that point. \n\nLearning from a book and classes with no intention. Very slim chance for me to really get it.",
