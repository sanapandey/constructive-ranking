    "selftext": "When I started on it I guess it helped me concentrate at work, and it sure made me less distracting of others. Fast forward a few years and I have this overall feeling of lack of motivation but also a sense that I am just becoming a boring person, but part of me thought that was just the cost of being able to focus. Now for reasons related to motivated I asked psychiatrist to try dexamfetamine and wow within like 3 days while I did find myself more motivated, what I really noticed was that I felt like myself again. I was gaining benefit from the medication, concentration etc is better, but I\u2019m back to being convivial and light hearted and joking around. It\u2019s made me realise I had no idea what methylphenidate had done to my personality. I know others go in the opposite direction but thought someone might find this interesting. ",

Man-2-man. \n\nI tried a prescription for 6 months, and that was one of the best takeaways from the experience. I had so much patience for my family and friends. I often let impulsive thoughts go unsaid and socially. Things flowed in a different way. Although this didn't last forever and strangely as time went on, I found my patience thinned, and I became irritable. I stopped the use before the dose went up. \n\nI don't usually line up with others and what they're saying, either. Interestingly, now that I'm getting older, I do have a greater capacity to let people express themselves, and hopefully, in the end, I am heard as well. But my attachment to the outcome of being heard has lightened, so i just don't seem to be bothered as much as I had been before. \n\nWell, i recognize (and the right people will, too) the maturity in you being able to de-energize yourself. That takes maturity and good self-awareness.",

I pleaded in the beginning that I noticed changes (as a partner i considered myself to be an accurate reflection for her self-awareness). Something to note was that the addiction or dependence to the medication made my partner rationalize in many different ways about the continuation of the medication. Refusing the idea (thought experiment) that she was in fact addicted which eventually turned backward unto me as now I was unnecessarily judgmental, when in fact all my concerns stemmed from love. \n\nThe personality of my beloved woman continued to worsen, and the rationalizing created more distance between us as time went on. I continued to plea with her that the addiction was creating delusions that she took as significant truths. Efforts to protect were taken as personal attacks. \n\nI eventually could not bare the yelling outbursts and misinterpretation. It broke my heart, truly. As I decided to leave a person I was still in love with. But over the span of 18 months I no longer loved this new personality/person as I did before. I felt like something stole my beloved and just realized this recently through therapy.",

I'll say again, thank you for taking time out of your day to continue a discussion.  I'm just home from work. \n\nUnderstood. I'll apologize once more. I have been trying to correct the way I address topics as i have been pointed out for being insensitive in the past. I'll take the time to adjust my responses. Thank you for further explanatio. It doesn't go unappreciated. \n\nIn honest reflection of my relationship, I certainly did have other aspects of the relationship that contributed to its downfall. I just have also noted that we were able to work through these things before, but i couldn't ignore the results as our capacity to work through everyday things dwindled. We both put our efforts forwards, so i just resorted to searching for answer/results by comparing what had changed from past/present and targeting what was evidently different. It's a multi-fauceted discussion. Things are complicated. \n\nPardon my use of the word 'reliance'. If you were to correct me, what word would be more suitable to use? \n\nAbsolutely. All in which you've achieved, the revelations you've learned, and the growth you've undergone will not vanish, and is still a part of you - always. \n\nMay I pressure you on that point?  Have you had times where you decided to stop medications? If you have, what was it like, and did you have any thoughts about staying off of medications, etc?",

Now on the dex for a month or so and it\u2019s been so much better, my motivation/productivity and relationships have both improved a lot. \nI think it\u2019s fairly frequent for this to occur. Happy for you and grateful for us that we\u2019re able to access and try alternatives that work :)",
