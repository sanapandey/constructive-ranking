    "selftext": "Forgive me if this has been discussed nearly billions of times but i wanted to ask due to the shortage if people feel like SANDOZ is more efffective? I feel like alot of manufacturers have changed their ingredients in their medications. I have used KVKT/SUNP and now it seems nearly impossible to find that anywhere. What manufacturers have you guys used that you notice and feel like youre not taking a sugar pill? ",
