    "selftext": "I woke up this morning thinking today was going to be productive and as I was about to shower I realized I had a small black head on my nose. When I squeezed it, I realized how satisfying it was to pop it so I began looking for more and more. I feel so upset for wasting so much time and losing track. At least I feel more assured that maybe the medication does help me with my impulses more than I thought, because usually when I wake up I take my meds right away. ",

The series 2 are better in quiet environments (though they still make some noise, had one time where a participant in a meeting was bothered by them) and are bigger in form, also softer to the touch.\nBecause they are bigger i can use them with one hand and don\u2018t need to look at them.\n\nThe 2 sets are great, i have one at home at my couch to use when i watch videos or other stuff and one set in a case in my backpack for meetings, my therapie sessions and other occasions.\n\nThe clicky ones are only for home use, because they are really loud (louder than a ballpoint pen). They have a more plastic feel to it and are smaller.\nI still like them when i am alone and i do something quiet, the clicks then are a second stimulant for me.\n\nSo they have different uses for different scenarios. The same goes for how many you use.\nMost of the time i use 6 pieces, because that\u2018s the sweet spot for one hand use for me. But sometimes i use 8 or all 12.\n\nIn the box is a qr code that sends you to their youtube channel and they show you some figurations and forms you can use 6/8/12 of them!\n\nAnd i recently ordered 12 new ones from the new gemstone collection (because why not \ud83d\ude05) and black clicky ones before they are out of print.

I also try to not turn on my bathroom light at all so I can\u2019t see my face enough to find things to pick at. I have a nightlight in my bathroom to see enough to function, and sometimes I light a candle to provide a little more light while I shower. This works because I usually shower at night, but I still sometimes turn on the light for whatever reason and end up picking for a long time before I can get myself to stop. Once the damage has been done, clean the area and keep it moist to help with healing and scarring! Vaseline slugging seemed to break me out more, so I use pimple patches and they reallyyy help.\n\nSide note: I want a shower clock to help with time blindness in the shower, but I also want the lights off to keep me from picking. So, I will look for a shower clock with a light for the face of it.",
