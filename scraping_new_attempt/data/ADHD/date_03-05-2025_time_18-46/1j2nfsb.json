    "selftext": "Saw a post about being home alone makes them \"regress\" or do nothing. I thought it was common knowledge that one of ADHD's core struggles is executive dysfunction, aka you need someone/something other than yourself in charge.\n\nYou may notice this in ways like brushing your teeth/showering when you have to leave the house compared to when you don't. Or when you have a deadline impending vs a task with no deadline. When someone is home that is expecting chores to be done vs when you're home alone.\n\nYes, it's not impossible to self motivate, but it's inconsistent at best. So any possible way you can outsource consequences or expectations of your behavior, goals, or tasks should be taken if you're wanting to see more consistent functioning.\n\nUnderstanding ADHD is half the battle! The more you understand how your brain works, the more you can work with it.",

Slowly the dishes would pile up because I'm incapable of even considering doing them at this point, and my mood would get progressively worse.  Eventually the dishes would get to a point where I didn't even have any serving bowls left to use as a makeshift plate; simultaneously I'd withdraw and not leave the house for a bit, until at some point I manage to summon a desperate spark of inspiration and actually do the dishes.  Then suddenly I'd feel like a functional human being again, my mood would improve, and we start the cycle again.\n\nThis was all before I had a dishwasher, so it's somewhat less terrible now than it was before when everything had to be hand-wadhed, although it still happens to some extent with pots and pans",

Honestly, these \"ADHD pro-tips\" that give a blanket, definitive answer, to me, are ultimately insufficient. In this case, the core issue is motivation. Yes, having another person to hold you accountable *can* help, but to me, that's not a viable long-term solution. I can't constantly be dependent on another person sitting next to me while I work. Instead, I've focused on my own behavior and environment. What conditions help me to focus? Maybe putting on a podcast is better for my productivity than sitting in silence, or maybe music is better than a podcast. When it's time to sit and focus, I try to set up my surroundings to give me the environment I need. Knowing your own patterns is part of it too. For instance, maybe I know I'm most able to sit and look at my computer for an extended period of time after lunch, so I should schedule my meetings, which are more actively engaging, in the mornings. And hey, maybe I can only really sit and focus on Excel sheets for 3 hours in a day no matter when those hours happen. If I recognize that, I can plan around it. \n\nAlso, literally everyone with ADHD can tell you that external accountability is not in any way a requirement for getting shit done. We've all accidentally spent 6 hours working on something because we got sucked into it. Reframing the kind of shit I don't want to do as something that I do want to do for whatever reason, as lame as that sounds, is helpful. This also helps find places where we're holding ourselves to standards of others just because we think we're supposed to do that. This is where acknowledging the limits we have because of ADHD comes in handy. There are plenty of tasks that take way more energy for me than they do for someone without executive dysfunction, so why should I expect myself to get the same stuff done? Why should I hold myself to arbitrary external standards if they don't mean anything to me? And if they *do* mean something to me, then it's much easier to keep myself motivated. Thinking this way has been really helpful for me to build long-term sustainable habits. Finding better medication has also helped a ton.",
