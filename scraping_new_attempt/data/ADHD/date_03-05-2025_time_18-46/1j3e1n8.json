Quick to anger, strong sense of justice, extreme emotions in general, struggling to fit in or feel \u201cnormal.\u201d I got in trouble for daydreaming in class a lot, but that\u2019s partly because I already understood all the material and was so bored. Lots of doodling/drawing on papers. Chronic procrastination, extremely messy room, and lots of sensory issues. I hated crayons, chalk, pastels, construction paper. Crappy scissors that would fold the paper instead of cutting it would give me full body shivers and make me scream out loud. I hated showering and was very sensitive to changes in temperature.",

Turns out when you tell a kid that they are difficult for 20 years, and never tell them they are good at anything, because, \"well they should know, their grades/scores are great\" they completely self-destruct.\n\nOn the other hand, I've always been relatively successful. I've had two businesses, recently started another one. I wish I'd been treated with a lot more empathy and a lot less condemnation as a kid. I always envied the boys, who were given plenty of leeway and excuses. Talking during class, not paying attention, making careless errors or turning assignments in late were personal failures as a girl, but totally understandable for \"genius\" guys.\n\nTurns out, I'm perpetually single with very little empathy for men who can't get it together now.

Self control was a big one as I got older, very easy to think \"I can, so I will\" when it comes to indulgences.\n\nPart of the reason I think I managed to do well at school was my fidgeting. Because I just did it regardless, I was able to pay more attention. That combined with broadly speaking enjoying learning new things, and putting a lot of stock in being smart (because I wasn't sporty or social or anything else), I managed to do well. It definitely caught up to me as I progressed through school though, because you do eventually reach a point where you have to more actively apply yourself.",

This isn't to brag, but to show that it was the reason I didn't get diagnosed until I graduated college. No one suspected it because I did so well in school. But it was BRUTAL. I cried and had emotional overstimulation breakdowns over simple homework questions that I overthought, I questioned everything in school and challenged the teachers because I was so hard stuck on fact and specifics. \n\nI was at the same time super aware of details and making sure everything was perfect but missed the most simplest of requirements. I had poor handwriting, my brain always ran too fast and too ahead, daydreaming, hypersensitive to a lot of stimulation, anxious and often left school because of it. The lights always bothered me. The perfectionism left me struggling daily about how I was an imposter and failure and if I didn't do the steps in order or have a strict schedule and predictable outcomes, I'd stress even more. \n\nMy symptoms got worse after I got out of school because the structure of classes and predictability of everyday being a requirement went away. Then I got very disorganized, my sleep schedule went out of whack, my task paralysis got worse, distract ability got worse, depression got worse with entering mundane workforce, etc etc. \n\nIt's to show that even the most successful students can struggle. My mom always tells me she feels she failed me because she didn't know. But neither did I \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",

I doodled and wrote a lot in classes that bored me, just kinda disappeared into whatever I found more interesting. Teachers often said some version of \"She'd be a wonderful student if she just applied herself\" about me. \n\nMy first foray into university was disastrous, the lack of teachers pushing me to get my shit done sent me spiralling. I think that was a huge red flag to my psychiatrist, as soon as the structure was gone I couldn't handle school.\n\nEdit: And the fidgeting! Knee bouncing \"runs in my family\" which I now suspect is just a symptom of ADHD running in my family. I'd get in trouble for bouncing my knee and disrupting other students.",

I had a natural inclination towards writing and language, so I could make it seem like I knew what I was talking about by writing an intricate essay or making something up, when I actually hadn\u2019t bothered paying attention or learning at all (I actually had a teacher in high school come up to me and tell me \u201cit\u2019s well written, but you didn\u2019t really say anything\u201d, but still gave me an A lol)\n\nSocially, I wasn\u2019t an outcast or anything, but spent most of my time alone outside of school. I would have a few friend groups throughout the years, but definitely had some situations around middle school where I started feeling a sense of rejection on some level, which resulted in me escalating the level of drama way too high, and losing most of my friends as a result. In the past few years (my late 20s/early 30s) I learned about rejection sensitivity being associated with ADHD, and it made a LOT of sense.\n\nI was a high achiever academically pretty much only because I was able to try to figure stuff out based on what I already knew, but when it came to something I had no previous experience in or didn\u2019t care about, the wheels really came off in those situations. My achilles heel were literature classes where I almost always found it impossible to get through boring books. If it weren\u2019t for sparknotes/cliffnotes I definitely would have done WAY worse.\n\nThat got even worse in college when I got to classes where the extent of my interests hadn\u2018t prepared me for what I would need to learn. That\u2019s when I got my first C in a class, which almost was an F because I forgot the time slot for the final exam and only realized that when it was halfway through the time slot. I had to sprint to the lecture hall, fill in what I knew, and just guess on the rest of the questions.\n\nAfter college, the wheels came off even further. I realized I really hated the career path I was on, which I only chose because my family told me to. My 20s were not particularly great because I was used to being seen, and feeling like, a high achiever, but suddenly I wasn\u2019t. I hated applying for jobs because of the feeling of rejection, so I would often just give up. I only really figured out that ADHD mapped onto my life pretty clearly in my late 20s, and now in my early 30s, I\u2019d say that I\u2019m actually excited for the future (but I don\u2019t really have expectations for what the future holds). It took me a while to try to let go of the need to be \u201dthe best\u201d and to accept myself for the flawed person that I am, understanding that the way my mind operates has its strengths and flaws, to not beat myself up over the flaws, and let the strengths lead the way.",

            "body": "Oh man, once I had the diagnosis and knew what I was looking for the signs were literally everywhere.\n\nIn fact, a lot of my memories from childhood are memories precisely because they were notable to me in some way (because they were moments of me realizing or feeling Different or Weird or Embarrassed etc).\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nAny time anyone talks about me as a toddler, they always, always, always mention *the* iconic mental image everyone has of me at that age: sucking my thumb while twirling my hair around my finger. My mother had to keep my hair short because all the twirling kept leading to tangles she could only cut out, and I needed a retainer type thing at the age of 8 to counter the overbite I\u2019d created by pushing my top front teeth forward with my thumb while sucking on it. My dentist told me I needed to stop doing that and, somehow, that was the one time in my life I managed to change a habit immediately. I simply never sucked my thumb again. No idea why that one worked.\n\nOne of my few distinct memories from preschool is based on the activity system my teacher had in place in our class. She had a poster of pockets hanging on the wall, where each pocket represented one of the children. There were cards for each activity, limited by the number of kids who could do that activity at the same time. If you wanted to do the activity, you would put the card with your name in the pocket to indicate you were doing that activity, and if all the cards were taken you had to wait your turn and do something else. One day, I wanted to do an activity, but someone else had used the card. I can\u2019t recall the details, but the gist was I had an understanding that *I* was to be using that card and not the classmate. Maybe I alleged he stole it out of my pocket or something? Idk, it\u2019s really not relevant because when I went to the teacher about it, she looked at me in surprise and reminded me we weren\u2019t using the pockets today, it was a total free activity day (probably end of semester or something? No idea). I say \u201creminded\u201d, but this was the first I was hearing about it. Clearly she\u2019d announced and explained it at the start of the day, and clearly I had 100% missed it.\n\nIn kindergarten, a few months before moving up to grade 1, we got to go to the grade 1 classroom for a sort of open house test day, to see what grade 1 was like. We got there and we were given a little piece of paper with a design on it and told that when we were done colouring it we would move onto the next grade 1 thing. I grabbed a red pencil, scrawled a bunch of lines over the design until it was all roughly red, and looked up, done, and eager to move onto the next thing. There was no moving on, and I looked around to see that everyone around me was carefully colouring in the picture, taking their time, because apparently this wasn\u2019t a \u201cget this out of the way then we can move onto\u201d task but an actual activity.\n\nIn grade 4, we would have free reading periods, where we\u2019d sit in class and read our books to ourselves. One day, I looked up from my book to realize the teacher was teaching something. Free reading period had ended some mysterious amount of time ago and I\u2019d completely fucking missed that and just kept on reading.\n\nAt the age of 8 I started violin lessons. This was of my own volition and I was very excited. I barely practiced. Every few years my teacher would sit me down for an \u201cAre you sure you want to continue lessons? You don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t enjoy it, it\u2019s your choice, not your parents\u2019\u201d. And every single time I knew why she was asking, and I also knew I wanted to continue. I really liked learning the violin, I also didn\u2019t understand why I barely practiced. \n\nAt some point in grade 9, I was writing a newly received grade into my agenda\u2019s grade tracker and  doing a rough calculation of what my average for that class was, when suddenly it dawned on me that the grades in my elementary school report cards had *also* been averages, that my teachers hadn\u2019t decided them based on vibes, but calculated them from the grades I received on tests, just like now in high school. Not once throughout elementary school had I ever considered the grades I received actually did or meant anything other than whether I\u2019d done well on that particular test or not. Genuinely blew my mind.\n\nIn grade 10 chemistry, one day, we did an experiment. My teacher gave us fully verbal instructions for the experiment at the start and then left us to it. After every single step, I had to go up to him and ask what the next step was. Nobody else in the class did that. They just went through the experiment. I still struggle with the idea that all of them retained every single step of that experiment just from having heard it once. More steps than me? Sure. *All* of them?? Genuinely cannot fathom this.\n\nIn general, if my teachers didn\u2019t write down our homework for the next class on the blackboard before class was over, I missed at least part of it.\nI heard them say it, but I could never retain all of it long enough to write down. Dictation tests in elementary school were similarly stressful.\nI was a very, very good speller and never even studied for them, but when the test involved full sentences instead of just individual words, the teacher never quite repeated it enough times for me to get the whole thing down without going into full Mission Impossible mode, and I\u2019d usually have to block out the first reading of the next sentence in order to finish off the last one. So it all compounded.\n\nAs has been mentioned in another comment, my notebooks from grade school through university are more doodles and random scrawls than actual notes. In general, I am really fucking bad at taking notes. For the exact same reason as the dictation tests. Can\u2019t hold the information in my head long enough to get it down, especially when I\u2019m also trying to listen to and process the next thing being said. Eventually I always have to make the choice to either get down the notes, or actually properly listen to, process, and engage with the lecture.",

The pattern had to do with whether that semester involved more rote memory tests or not. Language classes were the biggest swings. German reading comprehension test, I did great. German idiom test that involved straight memorisation of 5 pages of idioms from our German idiom book, yeah that was an inevitable fail.\n\nMy mother got me my first personal CD player/tape deck/radio thing for my 8th birthday (so that I could have the freedom to develop my own taste in music without her having to suffer through it lmao). From our American neighbours we inherited a teenage mutant ninja turtle story tape. I *loved* listening to that shit after lights out to lull me to sleep. Later on I did the same with our Lord of the Rings BBC radio play CDs. And as time wore on, I turned the volume lower and lower, until eventually all I could actually hear was the murmur and rhythms of speech, not any of the actual words themselves. Never bothered to spend a single second wondering why I loved that and found it soothing, but I did it for years.\n\nWe all still wore wristwatches at this time. In high school, in an attempt to counter my tendency to wait until the last possible moment to leave for school, inevitably ending up being late half the time if the wind was blowing against me (I cycled), or the lights worked against me, etc. I started setting my watch to run fast, but doing so randomly, so that I didn\u2019t actually know exactly how many minutes it was running fast and therefore couldn\u2019t rely on \u201cit takes me 17 minutes to cycle to school so I only need to leave when my watch says 8:14\u201d or whatever. Inevitably, I would eventually start to work out exactly how fast my watch was running, at which point I would reset it to a different randomly fast time.\n\nI\u2019m very sensitive to people telling off other people\u2019s children, especially if their parents are right there, because it happened to me a lot and it left a lasting impression of Badness on me. If the parent is there, mention the behaviour to them and let them tell off the kid.\n\nPretty much every birthday part I ever had ended in me crying in my room or going to my mother and saying \u201cThat was fun, make everyone go away now.\u201d Overstimulation. Similarly, I did not do crowds well. I do them better now, but mostly I know myself well enough to avoid them. My friends and I went to a funfair once in my teens, and I was really relieved when one of them got on the very first ride she saw and promptly threw up and decided she had to go home, because I was feeling nauseous just standing there among all those people and really wanted to leave, and now I could offer to accompany her.\n\nI went through about a million sports. Track and field was my favourite and the one I stuck with longest, but even that was only 3 years.\n\nI drove my friend insane in high school clacking the heels of my boots against the floor all class during winter.\n\nAnd, of course, the classic, my violin teacher and every single teacher for any of my weaker classes, or even my stronger classes, told my mother I would get top/higher grades if I was actually interested in the subject/put in the work. \n\nExcept physics. There was no saving me in physics and my teacher appears to have recognised that. I passed grade 10 physics on a rounding technicality, which I got to because my teacher made a tiny grading error on my final test of the year. I\u2019ve never been able to work out whether that was deliberate or not as a tiny favour in the knowledge that I\u2019d never be taking another physics class again.\n\nAnyway, hopefully this gives some breadth of examples. I\u2019m sure I could find more in my memories if so called upon.",

Bored with what we were doing 10 minutes earlier. Bored entertaining myself. I was pretty much up my sisters or dads butt 24/7 to do something with me.

Got caught in class for daydreaming/doing adjacent tasks to sustain attention (drawing/being on other websites)- got a few detentions for it. I even had a teacher call my parents in to accuse them of neglect?? (crazy btw! it was kinda racially charged..)\n\nAlways had a messy room (and system) and forgot things like books/homework. Chronic procrastination. Hyperfixation (I was a Tumblr kid lol). Chattiness (definitely pushed people away from me growing up). Early negative self-talk (as I experience rejection sensitivity). Social stimulation dependence. Interest motivated which reflected in my grades; the gap between my fav and least fav subjects was comedic. I struggled maintaining long-term friendships, as emotional permanence got hard once everyone began depending on messaging apps.\n\nTrouble with instructions- I knew HOW to follow rules and did so well. I struggled mentally; my dad often got confused why I couldnt just go from \"A to B\" instead of meandering and going on a stroll down to C or D or whatever. I did everything out of order. I also struggled at home with instruction. Someone telling me to do Task B while doing Task A could ruin my entire evening. I remember crying to my mother about how I couldnt understand why my brain was so hypervigilant about 'doing things right'- I couldnt even engage in a hobby without worrying.\n\nSleepiness, which is underrated. I almost never fell asleep without reading a book before bed. I struggled to wake up and always felt sleepy in school, especially as a teenager- I got berated for that one the most. Meds have helped me realise its not normal to feel so tired all the time. My low energy was such an issue that my mum thought I had thyroid problems. I also experience frequent night-time paranoia/sleep-paralysis- the list goes on.\n\nI agree that the 'failing school' narrative is reductive- psychopathology has a way in painting our 'symptoms' as only negative impacts on our lives. Its necessary, yes, but Its kinda offensive and I hope the point-of-view changes in the future. ADHD is a disorder, but it also shaped my self-expression and world-view. I need a diagnosis because im actively dysfunctional as a young adult (failing university lessgo), but ADHD also forms the defining parts of me that dont need 'fixing'.

            "body": "I did pretty well in primary and secondary school. I loved learning, and apparently I was a sponge at absorbing knowledge.in upper secondary school I started struggling. Subjects I used to love suddenly felt alien to me. Like math and physics. So I ended up focusing on subjects that were still \"easy\" to me, which was basically everything under the humaniora umbrella, in particular writing and languages. I ended up doing my masters in English and international business communication, where I did well on the English part and struggled in some areas of the communications bit.\n\nWhen at 37 (I'm currently 44) I was in the process of being diagnosed and had to reflect on which difficulties I faced during my upper secondary school years, I realized that I wasn't stupid or lazy... My brain just didn't allow for me to study the topics that were no longer easy to me... Like math and physics... I remember being so frustrated because I'd read the same page over and over and over, and the material just would not stick in my head! I highlighted, I took notes, I used post it's, nothing helped, and I felt so ridiculously stupid... Everyone else could study, come to class prepared and answer the study questions, and I would be looking at my carefully written notes and answer sheets, and it was as if the words were jumping around the page, refusing to form legible sentences! My teachers were often frustrated with me and would tell me the classic of \"if you just try a little harder...\"  Yeah, it's not like I wasn't trying! \n\nI also remember realizing that the laziness I had often been accused of, especially by my dad, was really me being easily distracted from boring tasks. Like tidying my room. He'd tell me, \"be done by 3pm\" which would be easy if you're motivated... But I rarely was, I'd get distracted by something I found during my tidying, and I'd spend hours doing that instead, usually a book that I'd end up reading. The worst part about this was that my father would react with anger if I hadn't managed to finish in time, and if I hadn't finished by the time the next day of school started, I'd come home to a cleared room and my things burning in the backyard... I spent many years terrified of not meeting his expectations, and fighting to prove that I wasn't lazy, and in particular that I wasn't stupid!\n\nAnother symptom on the completely opposite end of the spectrum was the fact that I didn't just think outside of the box - the box was in a ditch ten miles down the road. It still is, in fact I haven't seen the bloody thing in ages. BUT it got me in trouble with my peers, because my level of abstract thinking rarely matched theirs. So at ten, I'd have a reading comprehension and interpretation level of a student of 14 or 15.... Which apparently is a lot for that age... But that also meant that sometimes I'd ask questions my peers didn't understand or that my teachers couldn't answer! So I was bullied for being weird... As a result, I developed a class clown persona (if they HAVE to laugh at me, I'll make damn sure that I control what they laugh at!) to mask the hurt and humiliation. It became such a big part of my personality that it wasn't until about a year ago (when I crashed and burned with stress and depression) that I started dismantling it and find my way to who I am when I'm not trying to mask or be a fucking people pleaser....",

As a kid I was in at least 3 different sports at once and still had energy when I got home. As I got older and COVID hit I narrowed it down to just one sport which my senior year my team went to state, I was a starter, and I got all-section (I was one of the top players in the section tournament leading up to state.) I also did another activity which I went to state my Junior year of high school. During COVID, I got my first job at 14 and have had at least one job since then with a 4 month break during softball season my sophomore year. I am currently in a STEM major working two jobs and might be starting up a third. I do not know how to chill.\n\n2. Chronic procrastination. By middle school I was doing my homework assignments for my 8th period math class in my 7th period science class. I still did good in both of those classes. \n\n3. Disorganization. I have a perpetually messy room. The first day my room has been clean since I moved into that room was when I moved to college. Now I\u2019m in a dorm and while it\u2019s not messy it\u2019s still not clean (luckily my roommate is the same type of messy as me so she doesn\u2019t want to kill me)\n\n4. Sleep. This isn\u2019t an official ADHD thing but most people with it have troubles with sleep. For me, I can\u2019t turn off my mind and when I finally do and go to sleep, once my alarm goes off I still feel tired. It does not matter how much I sleep, I still feel exhausted. Luckily taking adderall seems to help me with that so hopefully I will be able to get that under control soon.\n\nAnother thing I have noticed about myself that I\u2019m not too sure are ADHD related or just a product of being me (or my anxiety and depression) is that I am perceived as the dumb blonde pretty often. I have naturally blonde curly hair and I have to actively focus on what somebody is saying for me to hear/process it properly. So when I work in customer service and somebody talks to me without any warning, I don\u2019t hear them properly, thus the dumb blonde stereotype. \n\nAlso I am a 19 year old woman with inattentive type. I also did very well in school (if we ignore online classes) and scored a 30 on my ACT with my individual scores being a 34 in science, 29 in math, 33 in reading, and 22 in English if people know what that means.",

(Also, grades are not affected by attendance or \"behaviour\" where I live; as long as you do the material well you get good grades).\n\n\nThere were some quite telling moment though, like when we had \"national tests\" in English and I completely missed to write half of it. (But the teachers had other materials to go off I don't think it affected my grades that much). Or when we were reading and I became so engrossed in the book that the whole class went out for a break and I didn't notice at all. Just looked up from the book and the room was completely empty of like 30 children xD.\n\n\nMaybe the most contributing factors however, was that I liked almost every subject + had some academic gifts. This meant that I was motivated, almost never got homework, and when we had, say, \"glossaries\" (translating words from/to other languages) I could memorise them during the 15 min break we had before the lesson/test. These strategies didn't exactly work when I entered university though, and tried to cram 2 months worth of material (like 2000 new words for anatomical structures in Latin) into 2 days of studying...

            "body": "I didn't struggle in school (grade-wise) because I'm also gifted (diagnosed along with my ADHD). My giftedness is actually what hindered my ADHD diagnosis in the first place. I can't even tell you how many health workers have told me that I \"can't have ADHD\" because I \"managed to graduate college\". When I look back, I've always showed a lot of symptoms that were overlooked because I was passing all my classes with flying grades - and that I myself didn't even realize were ADHD symptoms until after I got diagnosed (at 29) and started to understand the disorder beyond stereotypes. It also didn't help that I've developed a bunch of masking strategies.\n\nI have never paid attention to a single class in my life. I just physically can't. Everything I've ever learned was through self-study. During school, I was always reading a book, writing stories or drawing, but no one cared since it wasn't an outward disturbance. I had (and have) a lot of non-stereotypical hyperactivity, which also made a diagnosis more difficult. I was able to sit down for the whole class (which, to a LOT of medical professionals, automatically means one can't have ADHD), but I kept playing with my hair, poking my skin, biting my lips, and shaking my legs the whole time. Again: if it's not bothering anyone else, no one cares or pays attention. I felt overstimulated quite easily, so I always asked to \"go to the bathroom\" only to go outside and walk around a bit. When I got access to a phone that had earphones I would listen to music during my whole school day because it would help me focus (I still do this all the time). Chronic procrastinator, never studied for a test earlier than the day before and always completed every assignment on the adrenaline of deadlines. Also chronically tired, since, as we all know, trying to focus with ADHD requires a lot of energy.\n\nI also presented a lot of symptoms outside of school, but they labeled me a \"difficult and picky child\" and that was that. Mood swings (that I now understand were because of overstimulation and tiredness) and difficulty regulating emotions, stubbornness, messy room, lack of patience (bc tired and bc other people were too slow), millions of simultaneous hobbies that never lasted more than 6 months, bounds of hyperfocus that consumed my whole life, inability to pay attention to what other people are talking about unless I'm interested in the topic. The list goes on.",

With the constant change and expectations going up, I have had multiple emotional breakdowns and attitude shifts from the anxiety. Finally got help about 9 months ago, I have regained momentum, but still have my moments. I confuse the hell out of my husband/gets frustrated with , but my mom with ADHD completely understands me\u2026. \ud83d\ude02 Oh and I miss the context of a situation sometimes or not know what was asked because I focused on part 1. Lastly, I leave tasks undone and do them accordingly to how I see them. Come back to stuff hours later confused why the dryer door is open or a trail through the house.",

Loved to read...my mom took away my books because I would read in the dark and while I did dishes. Hard to make friends, felt like I didn't belong even with the few friends I had. Obsessions...you bet. I still hyperfixate. It's hard to pay attention to conversations, movies, etc. I rearrange the eggs in the carton so it's balanced.

I would do anything in a desperate bid to form a connection - including dumbing myself down to try and make myself look dumb so classmates would stop bullying me about my high test scores.

Hot dogs would send me into a wave of tears. \n\n \\- Lack of emotional response. This led to my sister labelling me as a sociopath for years. I wouldn't cry to any sort of bad news. If someone told me bad news (ie. a family member died), I would instead just ask loads of questions to further my understanding. Even when reporting bullying, I had no emotional reaction to it. \n\n \\- I could not shut up. Throughout the years, all my school reports were the same.

Ever. I could never have a good night sleep because of this.\n\nOther signs were: I talked a lot (but I mean, A LOT), messy room and feeling overwhelmed every time I tried to organize it, always doing homework at the very last minute (usually the night before at 00 AM), falling sleep every time I tried to read a book because it was too boring, constantly worrying about the future even as a kid, etc.\n\nThen, when I was a teenager, I started to feel a lot of anxiety, overthinking everything, depression, etc.",

I got in trouble for calling out answers without raising my hand. I frequently got in trouble for moving ahead with work. I would understand the math or whatever quickly, get bored while the lesson was explained over and over again so I'd look at the next chapter, take the chapter test and then do the next one and so on. I was sent to the principal's office once because the teacher walked by my desk and I was completing the test four or five chapters ahead of the lesson being taught. Quite literally being punished for being bright. Luckily, my parents were reasonable and all they wanted to know was were my answers correct. This did have an effect on me though. I learned to keep my mouth shut, to not draw attention to myself by finishing work early and to daydream looking at my book and not out the window.",

            "body": "I was officially diagnosed when I was 22, after suspecting it for 3 years. I wasn't tested earlier because I did well in school and was generally a rule follower, and when I had real trouble there was always another explanation (illnes, personality traits, having moved a lot etc.), and because so many people in my family have/had undiagnosed autism and/or adhd, so I seemed pretty normal to my parents. But looking back there were a lot of traits and symptoms:\n\nHyperactivity: Up until 5th grade I rarely went a whole day without playing outside (climbing trees, riding my bicycle, running around etc.) unless I was sick or something. When I was 10 we moved to a colder climate and I started getting more restless because I couldn't play outside as often, and it was no longer socially acceptable for girls to play and run around. Instead we were supposed to just \"hang\" and talk. I would have \"hyperactive episodes\" before bedtime where I would run around the kitchen table until I practically collapsed because I didn't get to move enough throughout the day.\n\nEasily dysregulated: I would very easily get upset by little things, especially anything done by my little sister. Unfortunately she always had a bigger reaction than me when we fought, so my parents didn't always notice how easily upset I was. And when they did I was just \"overly sensitive\". \nI also asked for \"crushing hugs\" all the time and had to be tickeled a lot before bedtime in order to calm down and eventually fall asleep. Looking back that was deffinetly me seeking sooting stimulus. \n\nDifficulties doing boring tasks: even though I did very well in school up until university, i had a really hard time with homework. My parents have told me I would often cry or even scream if they tried to make me do it in elementary school. I also remember crying a lot over homework when I was a little older, even if the material was easy. I often managed to get away with minimal effort because I would still do well on the tests. Similar story with chores. Hatet it, and did anything I could think of to get away from it.\n\nSocial difficulties: Tho a lot of my social difficulties were related to my autism or the fact that I moved around a lot, I have always had trouble listening to others without interrupting, and I have always had a tendency to talk A LOT (which is probably also related to hyperactivity). My parents could be bored to death by my long monologues, but they were used to it because it's normal in my family. I did however make friends very easily when I was younger (up until age 10). The real issues started when kids around me stopped acting like kids and social rules got more complex.",
