    "selftext": "\n\nI have this feeling that as soon as i got to acknowledge my adhd symptoms got worse or just that i never realized how hard it was. Like all of a sudden I actually NOTICE that I just can't concentrate, that I developed coping mechanism in order to try not to forget anything (i still do or can't bring myself to do the thing), I struggle sooooo much with executive dysfunction and its not just that I don't want it's my brain !!!! It all get like SO real like I'm not just lazy or distracted or yk, it's actually above me and it feels soooo weird.\u00a0Not to mention the hyperactivity part bc I always thought i was i lazy \"do nothing\" while my brain is like in constant \"movement\", i stim so much i never realized, I get so frustrated when its slow and everything like you know what do you mean in the end i'm not just a drama queen ???\n\nDid you guys went through the same thing ? :')",

It took me a while to realize I just had my eyes a little more open now, and I knew what to look for, but at first it felt like I was screwing things up a lot more. It was sobering to realize I always had been!",

Your brain is now rewiring, because it has found something that is connecting all the things. And the brain is also extremely good in recognizing a pattern after it has been seen. Like when you lesrn about a soecific type of car for the first time and suddenly you see them everywhere. They've always been there, you just weren't aware of it. Try to just let your brain do all the rewiring while also trying not to worry about it too much. Knowing what symptoms you have will allow you to better work with them in the future. And i think it's also crucial to understand and allow yourself to acceot that there are things that can't be changed and to not work against them.\nFor me for example one of the things that has asways drained me the most was sensory processing. I realised that rhere's no \"just fighting tgrought it\" and no exposure therapy that can help, so i listen more to my body when i am actually out of energy and then i can decide to not go do that social thing, even if i want to, brcause i know it will leave me exhausted for multiple days.",

The months between my realisation and the official diagnosis were miserable. I knew it to be the case and really wanted it to be the case but I was filled with paranoia. And self-hate. Because my brain knew something was actually wrong and was freaking out but since it wasn't confirmed, neither me nor my brain knew what to do. Cue extra potent symptoms and an increased self-hate as a result.\n\nAfter the diagnosis, I really wanted to talk and joke about it with friends and family. But a lot of the older generation kind of shut that down due to fear over prevalent misconceptions.\n\nNevertheless, I found that giving myself a wider berth helps a bit. Like, I know that my ADHD's gonna act up so I've learnt to accept more of my issues as something out of my control. This has significantly reduced my self-hate. (Some amount still lingers but it's significantly less than pre-diagnosis)\n\nIt does get a smidge annoying once in a while now that I know about it. But I've found that just letting yourself free to make mistakes helps a lot.\n\nAt least, now I don't react negatively to things unless it's a constant and repeated issue that's really messing with my head.",

Take your time, it\u2019s a huge shift in understanding yourself, honoring your limits and redefining your relationships, and grieving the past. Learning about adhd, connecting and venting online literally got me through the last two years! I needed to have the same angry drama queen meltdown conversation 40 times! A lot of feelings needed to be acknowledged and released. And the internet gave me space to do that lol. The energy has to be purged! Do what you need to do for you \ud83e\udd0d",
