    "selftext": "I am kinda doing okay in my life. I have a loving partner, really good friends, stay with my parents, don't have financial burdens. Only a hectic job. \nIt's just that always at the end of a routine day,  I am left feeling so numb and nostalgic for some reason. \nI feel like there's always this longing for a certain person or a certain situation. I don't know who or what those certain things are. \nI don't even know how to explain it. I don't feel sad. But it's a weird feeling of restlessness that never stops chasing me. \n\nIf you guys go through something similar, do you do anything in particular to make it better?",

What I\u2019ve found is I compartmentalize quite a bit and try to emote less bc otherwise I\u2019d be disappointed all the time. One issue is I haven\u2019t acknowledged or connected feelings as they relate to events/ actions. Instead I\u2019m nothing and don\u2019t feel much outwardly unless it\u2019s striking.\n\nShe\u2019s helping me connect events/ actions to emotions. We did some EMDR exercise that actually worked well",

The kinds of songs that when I am feeling low, sad, or anxious- when I put them on, I will feel a little bit better. Sometimes, I just have to sit with my noise cancelling headphones on, and my eyes closed for the first few songs. It might not work for you, and that's okay because we're all different. Good luck!",

Whatever happens happens I tell myself, its all in God's plan, happiness and belonging is just a luxury for us.\n\nThe only thing that i find keeps me grounded is pushing my body hard through running, it cleansed my body and mind.\n\nI done a 30 mile run the other day and feeling the burn throughout my whole body just makes me feel so much more alive. I lift as well but cycling and running has really helped me out. Maybe you could try..",
