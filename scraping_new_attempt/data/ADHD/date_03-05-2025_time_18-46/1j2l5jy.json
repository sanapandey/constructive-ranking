    "selftext": "Wondering what tactics people have found helpful in curbing your enthusiasm for new projects so they don't get out of hand and displace your unfinished other projects and hobbies?  \n\nRight now, for me, it's aquariums.  One should be enough for a while but not for me!  All I can think about is setting up another new one even though I just set up one for each of my kids in the past 2 months.  I don't want to create a bunch of new chores for myself that I regret later, and besides I have nowhere to put another tank because I need a bookshelf to store the books that were displaced when I reorganized my home office (project 90% done).  I won't be able to build that until I create space by finishing my project to refinish that side table (project 50% done).  And there's really not room to do that until I finish organizing all the chicken stuff so it's not getting in the way of the surfing stuff when spring comes...I could go on and on.  \n\nThis is a very cluttered and expensive way to live, and I'm curious how others reign it in until the newness wears off.  Adderall helps keep me focused for work and things, but doesn't slow down my obsessions with cool new stuff.  ",

Because the relearning gets tiresome, I try and keep just enough of my other interests going that I don't forget a bunch of shit. So I have a rough schedule, where on Tuesday I'll look at code for a bit. And on Thursday, I'll remix something. And I just have a few things like that to keep me from being totally sucked into one thing until it spits me out.",
