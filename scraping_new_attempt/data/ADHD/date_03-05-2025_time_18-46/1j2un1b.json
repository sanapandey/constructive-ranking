    "selftext": "I\u2019m currently on mydayis and i think it works wonderfully apart from a few things. One being i cannot ingest drinks with high sugar (soda sports drinks etc\u2026) without having crazy stomach issues throughout the day. Now i wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say i can\u2019t drink them at all it\u2019s only really when i drink them right after i take my meds. like for example on my way to work today i had a vitamin water because i wasn\u2019t super great yesterday and right after i finished the bottle i had pretty bad gas pains and they smelt horrible. But i know that this has happened on multiple occasion so if anyone else is experiencing this please let me know!",
