The best advice I\u2019ve ever had is use Certain Dri at night, and in the morning Mitchum or maybe Arm&Hammer. I have to change shirts 2 or 3 times a day. It\u2019s awful. Be very careful I gave myself a pretty nasty chemical burn with the Certain Dri stuff. Use petroleum jelly or fragrance free lotion if that happens don\u2019t put on my more deodorant. It\u2019s nice to know someone else struggles with this.",
