    "selftext": "Got diagnosed with ADHD last year.\n\nI'm taking adderall 7.5mg IR, but I only take one dose per day after I wake up. It's usually good enough to keep me working all day.\n\nBut the problem is I cannot sleep in 24 hour cycle any more. I start to sleep in 26 or 28 hours cycle which can be annoying. I am working from home with a relatively flexible schedule but sometimes it feels really weird to sleep at 6AM and wake up at 5PM.\n\nSometimes I can't stand it and stop taking adderall for a day or two. Then I can sleep fine. But I would feel like a zombie all day, get sleepy right after taking any meal, and get sluggish 5 minutes after I do anything.\n\nI tried to workout when I take adderall(I swim 30-ish minutes), but it does not help with sleep.\n\nI listen to very calming podcast to help me sleep as well every night. My bedroom is completely dark and I still wear an eyemask to sleep. I also wear earplugs. I basically maxxed out all the sleep hygenine setups.\n\nI don't know what I should do next.\n\nI really wish I can find a balance between being able to work and being able to sleep. Thanks for any help in advance.\n\n",

Are you taking it with a multivitamin?\n\n\n>calming podcast\u00a0\n\n\nNot bad, but not ideal If it's a new episode of a podcast, that means you're still injecting novelty try listening to the exact same episode for a week.\n\n\nAnd you haven't described what's going on in your brain during that time. Are you drifting to other thoughts? Are you just comfortable listening and awake?\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\nAre you in a reefer state? Some of us get a lot of night time help from that.",

I take 10mg hydroxyzine when I can't sleep but I guess it isn't exactly sustainable for everyday\n\nAlso for me some heavy metal music helps fall asleep. It's calming, but not all tracks and I need to fall asleep while it's on because after I pull the headphones out, I lack some sensory input",

            "body": "7.5mg IR is a really small dose and it should only last 4-6 hours. To put that in perspective, I too was diagnosed with ADHD last year and I take 30mg IR twice a day. I've had scripts for things like Hydroxyzine to help with sleep in the past (before I was diagnosed with ADHD.) But if 7.5 is screwing with you that much, you might want to discuss it with your psych and try a non-stim medication.\n\nThis is probably going to sound crazy but... have you thought about losing the eye mask? And losing the ear plugs? Those two things alone would keep me up. If I was doing anything close to that it would make me focus too much on sleeping and it wouldn't happen. Instead you might want to use a fan or a tv series as white noise (When I had a really hard time sleeping I found NASCAR was some of the best white noise to sleep to.) \n\nI have been a night owl my whole life. But I found I have an easy time falling asleep stupid early( it's almost as if I'm laying down for a nap) I end up waking up stupid early too, but I can still enjoy the quiet peacefulness of night, well early morning. But if I'm awake after 9-10pm, I'll be lucky to fall asleep before 4-5am. Which on a regular basis makes adulting tough. So you might want to try and take a nap/ pass out early, like around 8pm and see how it goes.",
