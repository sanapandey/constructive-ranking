    "selftext": "This year, I have been really on top of going to the gym 4-5 days a week. Some times 3 days, but no less than that. This has been the most consistent I\u2019ve been going. In the past, I would be really into it, then stop due to lack of sleep, period, or any other excuse. The issue would be getting back into it. \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m dealing with now. I was doing so good until this past week. I\u2019m on day 4 of no gym. I stopped due to a rough start to my period, but now that it\u2019s calmed, going to the gym sounds dreadful. I love whenever I am there and I do a workout I enjoy! I think it\u2019s the getting ready that makes it so hard. Anyone else relate?",

I've found that the only way I can be consistent in going to the gym is if I remove every barrier from me actually getting up and going. Like EVERY barrier. \n\nCase in point, the night before, I pack my gym bag with the next days work clothes, I put on the clothes I'm planning on wearing to the gym (yes I sleep in my gym clothes), I even set my socks and shoes out right next to my gym bag. I also pull a shaker bottle out and place it next to the kitchen sink, along with my pre-workout and protein shake. When my alarm goes off at 6:00 I know that all I have to do is brush my teeth and fill my shaker and I'm out the door by 6:10. Something about prepping all of this before makes getting up easier because I've pre-committed to all those other steps and my mind won't let me turn the alarm off and go back to sleep.\n\nGive it a try!",

I'd do one set of bench press then I'd be in front of my pc playing games or reading something until next set. Usually 2-3 mins later. On two braincells days, I like to split it between morning and evening if possible. Good days are good with full of energy though. \n\nI don't rely on motivation that much anymore. Discipline and forming habits work for me so even on bad days I try to finish some.",

            "body": "Yes. I really like when I\u2019m working out multiple times a week, but I just tend to fall out of the habit. What has helped me is being okay with that, and instead of focusing on being consistent in terms of not missing a day, week, etc., is to work on being consistent in terms of starting up again. A lot of the time I\u2019ll lift weights routinely for a few weeks, then not be up for it for a month, then do it again. If I feel guilty and worried about it, then it gets much harder to start again, because then it\u2019s only a matter of time until I stop working out and feel guilty all over again. But if I\u2019m okay with it, and accept it might be a while until I work out again, it\u2019s pretty easy to pick it back up very easily when I have the energy again. \n\nIf you set expectations that you can\u2019t meet, you\u2019ll start associating that task with failure. The more negative that association becomes, the harder it will be to do that task. \n\nAlso, just because you don\u2019t go to the gym doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t work out at all. Going to the gym can take a lot of time and mental energy, and you might not be up for getting ready to leave the house some days. It helps if you can come up with something else you can do that is still exercise, so you\u2019re still in the routine on lower-energy days. Having weights at home, having a bike, having a treadmill, etc. I have a hard time convincing myself to lift weights, but I can easily get myself to go for a three hour bike ride. I know I\u2019m not comfortable in public spaces, so I have weights at home. It\u2019s all about finding out what works for you, and how to minimize the mental friction of starting that task. And having options, so it\u2019s not a choice between working out the \u201cbest way\u201d or not at all. I\u2019d prefer to lift weights more, but biking still helps me sleep and helps with my energy levels and mood, so I still get the benefits of exercise, which helps avoid feeling like I \u201cfailed.\u201d",

I was so proud of myself and really started to see a difference in my mental health with like anxiety and sleep quality n stuff. \n\nThen I got sick. So I didn't go for a week. Then I went to visit my parents and there were huge snow storms so I didn't go. Then I had a ton of work and schoolwork to do, so I skipped the gym for that. It's been 3 1/2 weeks now and it feels like there's a giant, insurmountable wall that's preventing me from getting back to it despite trying for the past week\n\n\nI'm trying again tomorrow tho, hopefully this time will be the one \ud83d\ude4f",
