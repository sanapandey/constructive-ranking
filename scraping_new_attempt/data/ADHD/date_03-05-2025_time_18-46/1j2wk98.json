    "selftext": "I've been trying to address my ADHD lately as I feel it has quite a huge impact on my enjoyment of things. I don't enjoy playing a new game or watching a movie or listening to music one tenth of what I did as a kid and even as a teenager. Just very apathetic, I can put on again using listening to music for an example, I kinda just hear it and don't get that enveloped in it like I did in middle school, that's for sure.\n\nI've noticed many things that my brain just can't/won't do anymore. I get that the \"child-like wonder\" obviously doesn't have the same luster forever but man, I remember even up until my latter years of high school having just music videos play out in my head when listening to a song, I would think of stories to potentially create one day in my head as I'm falling asleep, stuff like that. Now it is impressive if I can visualize an object in my head for more than a few seconds before my head is immediately bouncing all over the place to other things.\n\nI'm trying to do things to improve my attention but definitely specifically wanting that sort of imagination and forming images in my head vividly back that I've clearly lost almost completely. Am open for suggestions. I will probably find a book to write as I feel like that's just the number one easy thing to do to improve mental visualization, but aside from that is there anything I could be doing more of? Am already doing standard attention-building activities like jigsaw puzzles and or word/math exercizes, but more visualization (and just being more apart of the activities/content I subject myself to) improvement/building activities I feel would definitely greatly help me and my enjoyment of life.",
