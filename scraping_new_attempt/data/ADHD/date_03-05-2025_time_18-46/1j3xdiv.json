    "selftext": "I love anime. And a while ago I came across this series called Solo Levelling. It\u2019s absolutely amazing and a growth arc for this underdog character who then becomes the most powerful person in all the realms. (I guess we all want to be that person, and I\u2019ve fantasised about it all my life, which now I can attribute to the challenges of ADHD.)\n\nBut, it\u2019s the manner in which he grows that caught my attention and interest more than anything else. He\u2019s a \u2018player\u2019 within a system which rewards him and penalises him based on daily achievements.\n\nHe can level up infinitely, and faces harder challenges each time. \n\nThe that stats which are in his control to improve are - HP, Intelligence, Agility, Strength, Health, Sense, and based on the nature or intensity of the challenge Fatigue increases. As he grows in level, he also gets different Titles and powers.\n\nObviously this fantasy world can\u2019t be translated into reality, but if you were to build a gamified system for yourself, how would you do it? Have you already managed to gamify parts of your life to counter your ADHD? What rewards do you give yourself or get? (This is especially hard for me because I get into phases where nothing interests me and no reward seems worth pursuing)\n\nVery curious to know your thoughts on this.",

I have to force myself to focus on whatever it is I\u2019m doing without over focusing. Meds help me with that.

I have set it up with a habit tracker app that allows me to, instead of tracking a specific action like working out, playing an instrument or meditating, just tick an option for an unspecified \"health\" or \"mind\" or \"spirit\" task, and once a week I go through the process and upload it to the character sheet. I intend to develop a way to do this automatically but for now it is a manual process.\n\n\nThe way I noticed this is helping me the most is that I am more present when I do things because I have to think about which category it belongs to and how big the action is, instead of autopiloting most of my day, which has led me to procrastinate and have anxiety before.\u00a0\n\n\nThe balancing part is just that I get a sort of a weekly overview of what I have and haven't focused, so if I don't get many exp for social or family it means I have to call my parents a bit more or set up dinner with friends for example, and for the days of mental paralysis... I have had a couple lately and I noticed that even by just doing a few things that earn exp I didn't feel like I wasted all of the day, but I always try not to be too hard on myself, have objectives and try to work towards them. My motto is that one step back doesn't invalidate all the previous hard work.\n\n\nI think some of the apps for habit tracking can be good, but we need to be creative on the approach of how to use them, otherwise they get boring really fast.",

But did you know that you can just lie to yourself about what you've done and what you deserve?   \nSure I said I'd only get this reward if I did these 4 chores, and I only did the 3 easy chores, but what if I just had the reward anyway? 3 out of 4 is pretty good. And the reward is right there, I literally have it already. And as long as no one knows that I'd planned to accomplish that fourth chore there's not even anyone to be mad.\n\nHabitica and Finch both worked until I figured out I could just check the box on Habitica to get the XP, and there's no consequence to not finishing your tasks in Finch.",

Things are starting to seem bleak for me now because all of the ways to cheat the system mentioned in some of the comments, including this, are things that I\u2019m guilty of doing.\n\nI approached my studies the same way throughout my school days. And when I got into college for UG, the accountability that my parents provided was also severed, so I was a loose cannon. Kept everything for the 11th hour - preparations, submissions, getting into class, waking up - and then I figured it\u2019s okay if I lose a few marks or just not turn in my assignments and that led to a completely different outcome. \n\nPG was even worse. The guardrails were off, and the freedom was too much to handle without having an internal system of accountability.\n\nThis continued into my professional career and then finally at 33 I got diagnosed and things started to make sense. I\u2019ve only just reached a point where I\u2019ve managed to curb some of my most destructive tendencies and looking to invest into systemic changes - internally and environmentally.",

I look at my job as a sort of game in itself bc the the better job I do the more likely I am to get a recommendation for  job of someone my customer knows. Also the faster I get done the faster I get paid and can move on to the next job before I get bored. I was diagnosed at 33 so my life choices and actions started to make alot more sense and also it was a huge help in recognizing that my oldest daughter also was showing a lot of symptoms so I was able to help her understand herself a little more and get her a diagnosis. I got my eye on that 5yr old too, shes a little TOO much like me \ud83e\udd23",
