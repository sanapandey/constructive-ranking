    "selftext": "**TL;DR: I have panic attacks any time I can\u2019t figure out tech stuff. Looking for advice.**\n\nAlmost every time I run into a tech problem I start to feel a panic attack come on. Can\u2019t get something to print? Panic. Can\u2019t get something to look right in word? Panic. \n\nI know some of this is exposure. The more I do it, the better it gets\u2014right? The problem gets *worse* when I try to resolve it. Trying to get formatting correct in Word, look up how to fix it\u2014and then my brain short-circuits. I will be able to read what is in front of me but I can\u2019t understand it. It gets worse the more anxious I get. At its worst, it\u2019s almost like dyslexia. \n\nToday, I was trying to make things easier. I am struggling to read stuff for my class. I\u2019ve printed hard copy and it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping. I seriously struggle to read on a screen (unless it\u2019s something I\u2019m interested in?). I tried to set up voice to read and spent the last hour and a half with zero results. \n\nI stepped away whenever I felt myself get anxious. I tried to do some deep breathing. I gave myself time to work on this. I just *can\u2019t* figure out tech stuff and I don\u2019t know why. \n\nI\u2019ve worked jobs where I was on computers for most of the day. In those jobs I had minimal issues with anxiety/panic and was pretty capable of being able to figure stuff out. I don\u2019t know what happened.\n\nI stepped away and texted my wife before total breakdown\u2014but I\u2019m so tired of the smallest tech problems having catastrophic results. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is a thing with other people or I\u2019m just all of a sudden computer illiterate. Any tips are greatly appreciated.",
