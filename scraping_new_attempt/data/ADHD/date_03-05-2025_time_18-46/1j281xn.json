I continued to listen to music while I did other things, until I heard the sound to indicate that they had died. But the music continued to play.\n\nI realized that there had not been any music playing at all, but rather the layers of chatter and songs in my head was loud enough to have me subconsciously thinking I was listening to music \ud83d\ude2d\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or anything similar?",
