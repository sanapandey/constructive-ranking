I can't just watch something unless it's a horror movie or something really really interesting. I tried fidget cubes but I keep losing them and also they're not as fun(?) and I tried doing hobbies like crocheting but I need more attention on the crochet so I drift from the show's content. \n\nPlease let me know some good things to do while watching stuff!",

I usually catch enough of the show to keep up with it but I miss plenty of it this way too lol. I also have to be on my phone or checking my email at the bare minimum when I\u2019m watching tv. I also need the captions on so I can read the conversations as well.  I use to just never watch any tv now I feel like all I do is watch tv lol.",

They make great gifts for kids or adults who are fun and playful. You can sell or donate them very easily if you accumulate too many and people will actually use and appreciate them. Very easy to make with no pattern or frog and redo if you fuck up.",
