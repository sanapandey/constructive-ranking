    "selftext": "For those of you that have been diagnosed since childhood, specifically those of you that couldn't really tolerate ADHD medication as a child, did that change as you grew up?\n\nI am on ADHD meds as are 2 out of my 3 children. The one that isn't medicated is the only one with physical hyperactivity. The rest of us joke that we wish we had just an ounce of her energy, as we have virtually none and that's being medicated. \n\nAnyway, I feel like she's tried everything and they either give her migraines or change her bubbly personality so drastically that it just isn't worth it. Her psychiatrist said some people just cannot tolerate ADHD meds. I was wondering if anyone else has had this issue and maybe \"grew out of it\" as you grew up. She doesn't NEED them, but wishes she had them to help her focus at school. I just wish I could help her somehow. ",

How severe?\n\nI've found that my side effects from stimulants have eased considerably. Not sure if they give me migraines as I have a migraine disorder anyway, so I can't weigh in on whether those go away. Protein before you take and hydrating is a must. Good sleep if she can manage it will help also.\n\nAside from that, has she tried non stimulant options?",
