    "selftext": "When I make a list, I do it in pen because the more permanent the mode the better your brain retains it. \n\nBut if I mess up more than a malwritten letter, I have to rewrite the whole list. I've noticed that if I try to write over it my brain complicates it more in my head because even though it knows what the task is, because it looks all jumbled from writing over the mistake it makes it seem more complicated than it actually is. \n\nIf I have to cross something out (from a mistake, not a completed goal), I have to rewrite it as well. My brain sees the space filled up with pen and thinks I have more things to do even though I don't. ",
