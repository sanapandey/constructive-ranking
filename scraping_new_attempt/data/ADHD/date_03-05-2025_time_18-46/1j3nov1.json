    "selftext": "I am 16 and I have suspected I may have ADHD for like 4 years. I've never been 100% sure because when I was 12 my best friend had ADHD so I thought maybe I just wanted to be like him. After that, I started going on social media and I figured I was like the people who self-diagnose and I was just being delusional. Also bc I think that I am tricking myself into experiencing symptoms if that makes sense. Anyway, a few weeks ago I asked my mom if she thinks I have it and she said no bc i'm not very energetic/hyperactive. I've done research on ADHD ofc bc I think I have it but that made me unsure. Then, the other day my moms friend said she always thought my mom had ADHD growing up \ud83d\ude2d. Recently every experience of having ADHD i've seen has resonated w me sm. Anyway my question is how do I get my mom to consider that I might have it without like telling her that I think I do.",

ADHD without hyperactive side. Much harder for people to understand including teachers. Had two sons one had each different type. Oldest son the teachers would repeatedly tell me he would do great if he just would turn in homework. I KNEW he had done it and it was either left at home, left in backpack or left in locker. Also would seem to pay attention to teacher but he was actually \u201coff walking around in his brain\u201d so not hearing anything teachers say. Wouldn\u2019t remember to get me to sign permission slips, or get money for activities. Would send him to get something or do something in another room say okay off he went ..much later he would ask what was I supposed to do/or get. But he could also put 100% laser attention on something he wanted to get into. Good luck..it is a learning curve.",
