    "selftext": "This question was posed to me by my therapist in a session yesterday and i've been thinking about it ever since. I can name a hundred things which drain my energy - lengthy social interactions, boring tasks, stress, overeating, etc - but it's hard for me to come up with things that give me energy other than my meds or exercise. I'm curious to hear answers from other ADHD folks to help me think about this more as it applies to myself. ",

Even if i wake up tired, depressed, one session and im up and energized. Higly suggest to everyone!\n\nEdit: i am following Breathe with Sandy on youtube. I also subscribed to his Pateron. He has videos that are easy to follow, from few minutes up to an hour. In the begging i didnt nocited much difference between differend styles, but after 2 weeks i started to notice major difference how they affect me differend! In the morning i do short 10 min video, when i get from from work i pick a bit longer one and on weekend i do 1 hour sessions (which i love!!!). The intensity of body feeling is higly depended on how hard i squeze pelvic flor and abs on breathe hold (on the inhale before the exhale retention). Doing it daily changed my life! For real. \n\nEnglish is not my primary language so bare with me \ud83d\ude48.",

Was I interrupting too much?) and then my mental exhaustion peaks as well. I've been avoiding hanging out during spares with new school friends (I'm 39) partly because i just can't deal with the mental load of being myself \ud83d\ude2d.

But I\u2019ve also realized everything drains me especially interacting with people and being outside which are hard to avoid and on days I\u2019m alone at home I have to recharge and don\u2019t exactly have much more energy. But! Last year I\u2019ve realized how much music helps me to get more energized mentally and feel more motivated in general. I love listening to girl boss type music or 2000\u2018s girl group songs with great vibes or watch a powerful live performance of my favorite artists having fun and that does energize me! Also planning my week and days having this problem in mind and organizing moments of relaxation/coming down from something exhausting like a hot shower with low lights or some mindless video gaming and knowing this time is precisely for regulating and destimulating so that I won\u2019t feel absolutely burned out after a busier schedule. But I\u2019m still struggling a lot with this tbh",
