    "selftext": "I used to love academic and work structures where I submitted my work up to some higher person for review / critique / feedback. Now I'm on my own, looking into freelance, and organizing my own life, passions, hobbies, and free time. I've found that without that person (preferable older, wiser, mentor-like) to motivate me, I end up in a rut. I don't know what the next best step is and I don't have motivation to complete it without an external deadline tied to a person and their expectations and needs from me. Not in a codependent way, I don't think; it's just the only thing that works for me. I'm super introverted but also super socially motivated. I wish I had any sort of structure for that which would create expectation for me to better myself and guide me to do so in the right ways. I just hate lacking this external input!! \n\nAre there, for example, websites for connecting with coworking buds or mentors? ",
