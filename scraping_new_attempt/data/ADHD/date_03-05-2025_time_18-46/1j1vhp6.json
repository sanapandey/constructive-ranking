He would hide under the bed and I'd bring him food there, then he would use the litter box while I was asleep. \n\nHe's getting a lot better though. Usually he's very cuddly with me. Helping him trust again has been a really rewarding experience. He just gets triggered by random changes from what he's used to (like me wearing pants lol).",

            "body": "As someone who had struggled with untreated ADHD, anxiety, and depression for my entire life, I thought I hit the jackpot when I started working from home 12 years ago. Sure, it was nice for the first year or two, but then I realized that going to work used to be one of my only social activities. I used to have to take a shower and get dressed for work every day, but working from home, I obviously didn't, which led to some really bad habits of not taking care of myself, and everything got a *lot* worse. Finally, I started taking my ADHD seriously last year, which helped immensely with the anxiety & depression, and one really big thing that really helped was instead of showering a couple of times a week like I had been, I started getting up every day and taking a shower and getting dressed as if I were going into the office. It's been a real life saver.",
