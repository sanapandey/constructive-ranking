    "selftext": "I used to be a very loved kid. When i was a kid, i was authentic and unintentionally funny. All my family members used to love me.\n\nThen i grew up. The more i grew, the more i struggled with my emotions, the more i didn\u2019t want anything with anyone. I never had purpose in life, i was just watching time go by, playing games and that was it. My life kept getting worse and worse and my family members were trying everything to communicate with me and offer some help. But i pushed them away over and over and over and over again.\n\nI found out about this disorder last year and started treatment. Now that i\u2019m medicated, i can finally care about my family members and i want to get closer to them again. But i feel like they all gave up on me. When i try to get closer to them now, they are not like they used to be and can i blame them?\n\nI never felt so lonely.",

I wasted my whole like I am diagnosed but no one will medicate me due to my past drug use / overdoses. So my life sucks. And I'm also lonely af. I have three kids 6,4,2 and one on the way and they keep me going. Without them I highly doubt I'd get out of bed tbh. I ruined my record with multiple felonies and feel like a scum bag when I go to any job interviews. I'm currently starting my own business so hoping and praying that works out bc I can't even get a job at a gas station warehouse or McDonald's (tried too many tkmes)",

Even when you do lash out (which I have, and apologized for and did my best to make amends for, but not always successfully) or find it hard to regulate emotions, it's not all your fault. Not everyone understands mental health conditions, even some of us that have them. I hope the people you love come to understand and find their way back to you, and if they don't, I hope you develop the coping skills to make that okay. Family is such a tricky thing, I think that's why I chose to start over myself. Whoever wants to be in my life, can and I'll be there with open arms, understanding, and forgiveness for myself and others. I hope in time, you can do the same.",

            "body": "My own experience is that having ADHD means that we wind up making a lot of really terrible assumptions for ourselves and for others. Any success I have ever experienced in life was due, in part, to having clear expectations.\n\nI didn't see anything in your post where you have said any of this to your family, as a way of an apology. You should be applauded for taking responsibility just to yourself for pushing them away - that's real growth to realize that and take ownership. \n\nSo rather than perhaps making assumptions - what would happen if you approached them and acknowledged that they tried in the past and that you didn't act right. That now you've done some work, you've been diagnosed, you have new perspective. A key is to understand that ADHD is an explanation, not an excuse. And so while you understand now why you did what you did, you'd still like to apologize for it.  People hurt loved ones unintentionally all of the time. Don't underestimate the power of a humble, honest, heartfelt apology.  \n\nGood luck. And seriously, I know that you're feeling down - but the story you wrote above is also a story about someone that is working at being better and understanding themselves more. You deserve credit for that.",
