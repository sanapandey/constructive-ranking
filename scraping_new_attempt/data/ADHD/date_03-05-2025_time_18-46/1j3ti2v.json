I tried them out today for the first time and the noise cancellation made my brain so quiet. I loved that i could also control the cancellation as well! Plus I love listening to music so it was a huge win for me. However the price is almost $600 dollars and idk where to even start looking for any dups that are good quality and give the same features (Noise Cancellation control and Playing music). Would anyone know of anything like them but not as pricey?",

The sennheisers are good because of volume and comfort so long as you don\u2019t sweat profusely (i do). I also have a fan in my office to add white noise because I have some really loud people around me.",
