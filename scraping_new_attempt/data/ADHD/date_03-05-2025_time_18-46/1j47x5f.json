    "selftext": "I have ADD and I take adderall so caffeine isn\u2019t necessarily a stimulant for me. Actually it has the opposite effect. I don\u2019t want to come off as one of those people who wanna be different, but genuinely caffeine doesn\u2019t touch me. I can drink 2 cups of coffee before bed, I can drink 6 cups of tea, I can drink any energy drink and feel no rush even when I don\u2019t take any meds. My problem is I drink energy drinks for the flavor. I love the carbonation, the taste, etc\u2026 what is a good substitute for energy drinks? Sure I can drink any pop, but it just isn\u2019t the same as a carbonated, red 40, terrible for my health, kickstart, rockstar, monster, so on\u2026 ",

For the last 6 years I\u2019ve drunk at least 2 large cups of Costa coffee every day and also had teas. Like you I can drink tea or coffee right before bed and it won\u2019t stop me getting to sleep. I\u2019ve always been a night owl going to bed at 2am regularly, often going till 4am on personal projects before calling it a night, and then having to be up by 7:30 to get ready for work. \n\nSince realising everyone around me is probably right, and I likely have ADHD, I\u2019ve decided to get assessed at 40 years old. The day I started to organise this assessment I also decided to go cold turkey on coffee to see what effect (if any) it had on my symptoms\u2026\n\nWell, I\u2019m finding that I\u2019m feeling pretty exhausted by late afternoon despite beginning to repay some of my colossal sleep debt. I\u2019ve been going to bed at 11am or earlier for the last 3 weeks and I feel worse for it. Is it the sleep or the lack of coffee? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always found getting a random early night always makes me feel less refreshed so I don\u2019t know. \n\nAs well as feeling tired by late afternoon I\u2019m also finding it much harder to stay focused on my work during the day and can\u2019t maintain any motivation.\n\nOn a positive note my wallet has thanked me for not wasting nearly \u00a310 every day on coffee.",
