I think it was magnesium citrate and vitamin c, but one type of magnesium gave people the shits.\n\nCan anyone link me to it? I've had a search and can't find anything.",

Mag Citrate will give you shits\n\n2) I recommend taking vitamin b complex and fish oil together (morning). Methylated vitamin b complex is better. \n\n3) also, zinc picolinate or glycinate (morning) \n\n4) vitamin c in the evening will help coming off. \n\nGood luck.",
