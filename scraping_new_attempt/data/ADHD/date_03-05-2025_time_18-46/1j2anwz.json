    "selftext": "I am guessing here, but I am not sure if this is what pattern recognition is\u2026 I met a colleague who was nice and all, but I knew from day 1 that she isn\u2019t the kind of person I would like to hangout with. Over months, I did everything to avoid getting close to her despite staying in the same hostel and traveling by the same office bus. One day I fell ill (rushed-into-emergency ill) and was hospitalised. My mom decided I will move into this colleague\u2019s room because she sounded super nice and responsible (lol). I, in my semi-sedated state, high on painkillers, begged her to not do this. Long story short, my mom breathed a sigh of relief when I stopped talking to this colleague 1 year later (she was let go, so I could avoid meeting her). She was exactly what I had predicted, a whole mess to deal with. Thank god I escaped all travel plans with her early on.",
