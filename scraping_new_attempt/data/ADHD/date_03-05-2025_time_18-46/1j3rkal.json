I\u2019ve decided I want to buy my own home in the next 4 years max, property prices are fast increasing and as someone who has a lot of relational trauma, struggles to live with people and experienced awful housing insecurity in London I\u2019ve made it my mission to own my own home.\n\nI\u2019m currently a digital nomad (but pay UK tax, and still registered there) in Africa at the moment so I can have the financial breathing room to truly develop the time to build my remote business without paying high rental costs. Whew. It\u2019s a challenge but I\u2019m determined especially as someone with really bad financial habits and impulsive spending. \n\nAny self employed homeowners in the house with ADHD? How did you do it and well done!\n\nPray for me please \ud83e\udd23\n\n30 FEMALE UK. ",
