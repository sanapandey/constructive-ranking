I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD as well as Autism (diagnosed with that quite young)\n\n\nMy psychiatrist has started me on Aspen/dexamphetamine  to see how I go over the next month. \n\nCan I just say, after taking it and all of the loudness and overstimulation I felt doing my work and day to day tasks has improved significantly! I can focus on one thing and not a million. I felt like crying, it felt like such a relief. \n\n\n\n",
