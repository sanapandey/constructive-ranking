Can't have lab now because I can't make the round trip to my room and back in fifteen minutes which is the limit before we're too late to attend. Ten minutes later, I'm walking home and suddenly realize that my alarm to remember my lab glasses never went off. \n\nThere's a gremlin inside my brain.",

If I didn\u2019t have mine with me I couldn\u2019t do lab, and I lived off campus so there was no chance I could make it back. Each missed lab day was -5% of your total grade too. Aside from lab you didn\u2019t need the board until the final, so I didn\u2019t even need this thing at home.\n\nSooo\u2026 _I hid my arduino in a lunchbox in a bush near class._ \n\nI did that. For a whole trimester. (It worked too.) I think maybe _I\u2019m_ the gremlin inside my brain.",

So it may need to wait a little bit.\u00a0\n\n\nDidn't people think you were suspicious pulling a random box out of a bush? I feel like I would need to laminate a note or something. Especially since this thing would need to be weather proof for the stuff we have here and I'd feel more secure if it had a lock on it.",

I did hide it in a bush behind the building, so there wasn\u2019t a lot of foot traffic other than stressed-out grad students sneaking a smoke break. \n\nMy campus was in a forest and was known for having more \ud83c\udf43 than alcohol, so it was pretty common for people to have smoking circles and stashes in the woods, too. Probably would be a lot weirder in the middle of a city campus \ud83d\ude02",
