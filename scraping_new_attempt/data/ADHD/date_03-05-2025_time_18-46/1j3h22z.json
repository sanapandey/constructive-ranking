Sleepy but also just not. I got a fuck load done though but this is not for me at all.  Please reassure me this fades out cos I like to feel very much real and not like a wired floating fairy :) \n\n",

I'm not sure if that's how it works.\n\nYou'll be okay, though. Drink some calming tea, do some stretches, etc.",
