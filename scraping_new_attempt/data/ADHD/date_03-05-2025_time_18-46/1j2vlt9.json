    "selftext": "My life is going completely downhill. I\u2019m suffering from depression, my parents are divorcing and my mental state is getting worse\n\nEveryday I just suffer, it\u2019s ether cutting myself or blaming it all in me. My best friend hasn\u2019t been talking to me and is dating my ex who ignored me even though she knew what I was going through.\n\nThis was around Christmas and she dumped me the minute after I got her gifts. Than I started self harm and it made me feel better. My friends found out and didn\u2019t really care.\n\nMy parents were arguing almost everyday and it just made it worse, I started to blame everything on myself and still do.\n\nMy mom found out I cut myself and promised she would get me help. It\u2019s been 2 months since than, my dad left 4 days ago, my mental health got worse and I stopped taking my medication which helps with my anxiety.\n\nI\u2019ve contemplated suicide multiple times and have almost done it. I need help and I feel that people that also suffer from the same issues I do will be able to help me.\n\nMy best friend BEST FRIEND is dating the girl the dumped me and blocked me and I don\u2019t know what to say to him and it\u2019s fucking me up that me would do that to me.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on what I can do to cope I would appreciate it",

I have many friends that I talk to on a regular basis but one of my friends who has just recently went through a break up told me to invest in god and read the scriptures, and that\u2019s what I did I deleted all social media off my phone and read my scriptures once a day everyday until I felt like there was more to me and more to life than to just be sad.\nAll in all I guess what I\u2019m saying is if you have more than on friend your close with maybe they can help you like mine did me.",
