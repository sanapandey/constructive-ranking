I know quite a few people who have similar stories, it breaks my heart because it is hard enough to get tested when your parents believe you. \n\nDespite what you think, you are not alone. I am a freshmen in college (I turned 19 last week) and I know quite a few people here who are scared to get tested because of what their parents think about it. \n\nIf you need somebody to talk to, DM me and I will respond. I am not a professional of any kind and I am still trying to figure out what my own diagnosis means but I understand what it\u2019s like to have everybody else think that you are fine when you are not.",
