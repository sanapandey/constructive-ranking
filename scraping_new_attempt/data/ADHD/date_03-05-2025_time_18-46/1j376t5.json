            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action. We intend this comment solely to be informative.*)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I found the distress tolerance and emotional regulation tools from DBT helpful for rejection sensitivity. They worked better than CBT for me because I needed to learn how to self-soothe before I could start challenging the thought patterns. Beyond that it's really about identifying the things that specifically give you the most trouble and putting in strategies to minimise them. For example, if you have trouble with audio processing if someone is talking to you from another room, you'd need to get in the habit of getting up and going in there to talk to them, or asking them to come in where you are rather than to try and talk from far away.",
