    "selftext": "I just keep making mistakes today while driving and I want to cry. Like I do my damnedest to be a careful driver, but today I keep screwing up massively. Like I'm lucky today nothing bad happened with the mistakes I made. \n\nThis just happened, I swear I looked both ways but between the construction and everything on the road I guess I just didn't register the car? The lane was moved to the center so maybe the cones made the grey car blend in especially cause the sky is very grey? Not making excuses just trying to figure out how I made such a dumb mistake. \n\nAnd there was a cone in the road, a small one, but still, that I rolled over when turning, I saw it, but I swear it just left my awareness as soon as I started to turn on to the road. Like, I saw it! I made note of it! It just disappeared out of my mind I guess?! Maybe it's because there's so much going on with all the construction around? IDK but I'm freaking out. \n\nAccidentally ran a light this morning when it freshly changed because despite being several car lengths back I couldn't see it over the semi truck, luckily the other light hadn't turned yet.\n\n\n\nLike I don't know how I'm holding it together at work right now, I wanna curl up and cry.",

I always make a conscious note to stop at every stop sign for the full like 2 seconds and actually look. \n\nBut even with this if i'm deep in a daydream or thought or whatever, i've accidentally ran red lights because i'm just on planet zustor and there's the cardiganian invasion what\u2019s a red light.\n\nTLDR; just force yourself to make good habits and be nice to yourself, note it and do better the next time. we all make mistakes weather people like to admit them or not",
