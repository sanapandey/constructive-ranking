    "selftext": "I have be n growing anxious lately because my mind is rejecting to age and I come up sounding like a baby in a room of adults. My thoughts are wise, the things I read ar great, my assessments are good but whenever I am in a meeting I end up sounding like a donkey and feel ashamed when I see people steering away from this unnecessary tangent I made.\n\nAnd th same happened with me and relationships. I never got together with anyone because the standard textbook boyfriend or crush is always someone confident or smart or looking great and whatever. I never fill those criterias and get rejected always. ",
