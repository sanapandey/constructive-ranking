I recently lost 2 of my close friends because of my difficulty being myself when I drink. I have since quit of course.\n\nI am extremely extroverted and don't have a difficult time talking to people. I have difficulty building a rapport and hanging out later. While this is not a big deal when I'm in my hometown, I feel very lonely when I am in a different city (I'm currently pursuing my masters at an international University)\n\nAny and all advice is welcome. Thank you! :')",

            "body": "I'm not great at this myself, but I got really fortunate this past year to make a friend who cares about the same things that I do. That was the big clicker for me. Make friends who have the same passions as you. I work with standardbred racehorses and my friend is an exercise rider for thoroughbreds, we met when we ended up riding at the same barn. Both of us are obsessed with horses and spend long hours grooming them. So we generally hangout while doing grooming. I've stopped riding and she's out of the province right now so we haven't seen each other in months but we send each other pictures of the horses we work with and we plan to board our horses at the same barn next year. So yeah, find your equivalent.  I ended up hanging out with my brother more because we decided to get a motorcycle license. Pick something you want to do and then find a friend to do it with. Adhd doesn't  really lend itself to passive tea party style functions.",
