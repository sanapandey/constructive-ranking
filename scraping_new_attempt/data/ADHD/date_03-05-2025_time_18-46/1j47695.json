I sleep 8 hours everyday, i drink a lot of water, i eat well, i socialise, i eat vitamins. \n\nStill when i come back from school i am unbelievably tired. My head had been hurting for months now, almost every day. I cannot focus in general, and when my head hurts, its even worse. \n\nI have a lot to do, and i can literally not move. i fall asleep in classes. I have low motivation and i stress all the time. I do not have the time or place to work out. Coffee makes me anxious, and i am anxious without it as well. \n\nWhat do i do, i feel like im going crazy...\n\nI ",

Depression and ADHD are unfortunately closely associated and don't always respond to one common treatment plan. If you haven't talked to your primary care provider about depression, it might be worth pursuing. Discussing your symptoms with them could also point them towards investigating some other condition. I wish you all the best. Please don't ever give up hope and know that the way you feel is temporary- life WILL get better.",

Can\u2019t find it, OF COURSE but I know POTS was on there. Look into it. I know I have it, waiting on my appointment to formally get diagnosed. Good luck \ud83d\udc97",
