    "selftext": "43M Diagnosed 9 months ago, ADD and high potential..\n\nStarted gradually using vyvansse last summer but stopped after reaching 40mg (so around 4 weeks), as the side effects were unbearable.\n\nOn Strattera for more than six months now; my neuropsychologist recommended a non-stimulating molecule. Side effects not so bad; beneficial effects limited, but perceptible. Really felt it while doing renovations (I stopped constantly looking for my hammer and whenever something unexpected happened, I could stay focused on finding a solution rather than just walking around the house), a little less so during my bureaucratic job, but still, an improvement.\n\nBut for the last weeks I'm suffering from the old usual glitches:\n\n\\- spent hours shopping online for a keyboard with an integrated pointing device while I have a working solution (I like trackpoints Thinkpad keyboards, but the seperate keyboard Lenovo sells comes with a flimsy mini-usb connexion that breaks too easily, the vintage one with a permanent connexion doesn't allow me to scroll, now waiting for vintage mechanical keyboard with a trackball from ebay)\n\n\\- \"stored\" a fresh cabbage in the freezer instead of the fridge (found it after looking in my car, in my bedroom, in the garbage, doubting that I had even carried it home and left it at work)\n\n\\- forgot after thirty seconds that I was waiting for a slice of bread to toast in the toaster for breakfast, just sitting idle beside my girlfriend who went to pick it up after a few minute\n\n\\- as I write this I am troubleshooting the pressure of my heating system (it's not cold, but one radiator doesn't heat), and putting a single plate in the dishwasher and forgetting to close the door\n\n\\- obviously forget tasks/meetigs at work\n\nReading here I see people describing miraculous effects for their medication. Should strattera help me more? And can it just stop working? I'm starting even to wonder wether I was prescribed a placebo...",
