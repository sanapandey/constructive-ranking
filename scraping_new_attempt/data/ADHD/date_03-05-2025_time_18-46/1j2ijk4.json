I can't help myself but compare myself trying my hardest to catch up to the bare minimum while others in my class can't even bring themselves to care but manage to do better than me. Talking during examinations, joking around during class, while my head blisters trying to understand a study. It's so hard not to compare myself to my peers when they are better at everything in the class while I struggle to catch up.\n\nI've heard so many \"study better\"s, \"put more effort in\"s, when it feels like a marathon to finish a sentence. I feel nothing but pure hatred even when I am supposed to admire those around me, I can never feel normal when I'm surrounded by prodigies. ",

I find myself feeling similarly, though mine isn't necessarily education focused.\n\nI mainly experience this because with generational poverty, generational trauma, ADHD, autism, and physical disabilities, I feel like the deck is so stacked against me that I have to give 300% just to reach the point where they *started out* and to reach any success I'd have to give 900% -- meanwhile they can give somewhere in the 30-60% range.\n\nYou're doing your best, though, so try to give yourself grace on these feelings of resentment for your peers. It's hard not to feel angry when we feel slighted by the universe, especially when we feel like we're giving it all we've got in the process.\n\nI'm proud of you, though, for staying in school, for recognizing these emotions that trouble you, and for sharing that here.",
