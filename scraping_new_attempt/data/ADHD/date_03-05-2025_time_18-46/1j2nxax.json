    "selftext": "I (45M) was recently diagnosed with ADHD-attentive and was given some literature by my Doctor's office that reads, and I quote: \n\n>Fostering social empathy from friends, family, and colleagues can significantly impact a social experience. Having regular check-ins or creating safe spaces for dialogue allows individuals to express their challenges without judgment. Encouraging understanding among peers promotes inclusivity and reduces the social burden often felt by those managing these conditions.\n\nThing is, in my experiences, I've only had one person ever be negative about ADHD, and even before I was diagnosed, never felt that my symptoms were a hinderance to my social life. I'm an introvert and even though I don't have a huge circle of friends, they're all really good with my quirks. \n\nI most definitely understand how unique this is, so what I want to ask is, for those of you who feel or felt this social burden and feel comfortable sharing, can you explain how ADHD has been a burden to you socially? I'd like to see it from your perspectives since I'm apparently really lucky having good people around me.",

Where it really hurt me was in office politics bc I still have a difficult time being fake interested in people that I don\u2019t like and wear my heart on my sleeve. I also have a hard time balancing friend vs work colleague and had to teach myself conversational boundaries as well as how to talk to people who don\u2019t have similar special interests.

Friends. If that makes sense? Someone to call and gossip with and make plans to see each other.\n\nI find that I am unable to get past that barrier of acquaintances to friends where someone actually looks forward to spending time with me outside of the social obligation we might be in. Also, I find most people have already developed their friend groups and aren't actively looking for new friends and because I have rather severe social anxiety (in friend making spaces. I'm super charismatic to the Walmart Cashier but not to potential friends \ud83d\ude2d), I also have a hard time asking for people's numbers or social media to keep in contact. Also I'm broke so I can't really go out and do fun things.\n\nI also recognize, I'm a lot. Like... I talk a lot, I'm loud and I can be very crass. Or I'm the exact opposite and I don't talk or share much. So either way, Only one person ends up talking and that can be awkward. And I'm not a huge extrovert, as a matter of fact if I can get away with it, I take every opportunity I can to NOT leave my house. But I also don't really play video games or join streams, etc.... Do when do I get an opportunity to talk to people who have similar interests?\n\nAlmost never. Especially because a lot of my interests are solo activities like reading or crocheting.\n\nSo... If I don't want to leave my house, I have a hard time talking to people, almost all my hobbies are solo hobbies, I don't use my computer to talk to people and the few people I do manage to have a social interaction with find me either annoying or energy draining.\n\nWhen am I gonna make friends?\n\nThe answer is never. And it sucks. But what can I do? I'm literally doing it to myself even if unintentionally.\n\nWhich is wild because my bf is the exact opposite and he'd become best friends with the homeless man on the corner street in the time he had to stop for a few minutes for the crosswalk light.",

You still have the condition and need to deal with it, but now you're doing it without help. That means that you're fucking up parts of your friendships that wouldn't have been affected if you had just been honest about your problems.\n\n\nImagine someone with cancer whose friends ask them to play basketball. They go to try to avoid problems, but get tired out/afraid of injury and have to basically return home. If they had just said, \"I'm not feeling very strong and I don't think I can do this,\" they could have gone to get ice cream instead.",

I do feel relieved when I can talk to another ADHDer who welcomes my interruptions and correctly attributes them to my interest in what they are saying.  Having to mask can be exhausting.  \n\nThat said, I'm a social butterfly with tons of friends, so I don't think it is a burden in making and keeping friends, but rather an emotional burden to follow unnatural (to me) social conventions.",

I can't imagine that.  My mind is always going, going, going making sleep hard.",

So when a really good friend was about to move abroad, I cried so hard at her bridal shower party not knowing why, only to understand later that it was because I knew it was gonna be the end of our friendship as it was. We are still friends, and I did visit her last 2 years, and it felt like we never separated, but there have been months where we didn't talk to each other. I tried to connect to her multiple times, but beyond texts, it was really hard to do a call with her, and I have to accept that I can't do much about it, especially without her effort as well. The odd of me finding another friendship like that feels very slim to none. And that is how ADHD becomes a social burden to me.",
