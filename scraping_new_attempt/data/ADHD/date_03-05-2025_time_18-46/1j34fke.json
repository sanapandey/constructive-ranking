They might not like it, but they can still get it done. Versus me, who\u2019s in a position to fail Italian class in college because I can\u2019t bring myself to learn a new language in any capacity. \n\nPretty much yapping to reach the word limit, but does it help with those types of things?\n\nEdit: when I say I couldn\u2019t bring myself, I physically could not study it, or listen. I want to learn so I can pass the class. And when I forced myself to sit and learn(often), not only did I get nothing done, but I genuinely wanted to off myself. The motivation is definitely there, but I\u2019m falling apart here",

It feels insurmountable. I can only shower on days when I have taken my meds, without them I will just sit on the floor and cry about how unclean I am but feel unable to initiate the task. There have been times where, even on meds, my husband has had to physically guide me into the shower and wash my hair for me to make the rest feel like a smaller task... Pretty embarrassing to admit as a 31 year old married woman \ud83d\ude05 And to think some people try to tell me ADHD is some super-power and definitely not all disabling \ud83d\ude44\nI have even considered just shaving my head so I dont have to think about drying my hair afterwards, but seems perhaps a disproportionately extreme solution... \n\nIm just glad im not a naturally sweaty person so I can go about 3 days with just a wee Belfast bath (sink and flannel) before I need to shower again. \nIf I had to shower daily I think Id have nothing left to give! \n\nFor the same reason, I never swim, despite really enjoying swimming. \ud83d\ude29 I just cant be fucked with having to shower and wash my hair after.

They've been put off for two years, and I did them in 4 days after being on adderall. I'm nervous this reaction won't last, and I was very hesitant to go on them to begin with. But my brain literally can finally handle things I hate, and I have become quite a bit more organized. \n\nThat being I am not eating as well as I should or hardly at all. When the meds wear off, I crash hard. 10 mg lasts me about 6 hours. After that 6 hours, I want to sleep. I am supposed to take two doses of 10 mg a day. I try to separate them so they last all day.

Concerta and Ritalin didn\u2019t work super well so I tried Adderall and it\u2019s been an absolute game changer\u2014the tasks I\u2019ve been putting off aren\u2019t massive, just things like deep cleaning the bathroom or finally organizing the bins stored under the bed, but still\u2014those tasks seemed borderline impossible just a few months ago. So silly in hindsight\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve experienced some rapid weight loss and loss of appetite on Adderall too. I also experience the crash. I\u2019m at a higher dose (30mg of XR and 15mg of IR when the 30 is wearing off) but it\u2019s noticeable when the medication begins to wear off and my irritability increases. Haven\u2019t experienced the headaches, fortunately\n\nThere\u2019s certainly pros and cons. The loss of appetite concerns me, but maybe it\u2019s something that can be dealt with if it allows me to actually do the things I say I\u2019ll do around the house",

Medication won\u2019t make you love the stop-and-go of city driving, but it helps you see the signs, gauge the gaps, and react before you miss a turn.

I find i have to make sure I am set up and ready to do something useful about 30 mins after i take mine... If I am sitting on my phone (like I am right now, woopsie) when the meds kick in I will find it really hard to stop being on my phone/move on to a more useful task. \n\nAs a tip for anyone else who finds this: i have found jt helps me transition if I do a more productive task that I enjoy more, even if it isnt remotely important at the time. \nFor example, I am currently in the university library with an entire novel to read and a presentation to write on it, due in 48hrs... But im stuck on reddit. Ive been unable for the last hour (!!) to transition to study so Im going to book my car for its service and MOT (which isnt due for 2 months, its super unimportant) but that will get me off my phone more easily cause its a small task AND it also has a completion point which will then male the transition to actual work easier. Im also going to deliberately do all this via the PC instead of my phone so I can get it out of my hand. (Also telling you redditors im going to do it makes me feel a little like ill be breaking a promise if i dont so thank you for just existing in the world)",
