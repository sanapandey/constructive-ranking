When I brought her to the shelter she was scanned for a microchip and she did have one but no one was registered to it at all. I still had to wait the 5 day waiting period just in case but Jo one claimed her so she came home today! They tried to quarantine her for 10 dayd for scratching a volunteer at the shelter but I talked to the bite coordinator and she said since the scratch came from her reaching out of her cage as the volunteer passed and not from aggression that she is fine with me doing at home quarantine. Especially since I'm a foster volunteer with 20 years experience. \n\nShe'll be spending a few days in my bathroom to acclimate. She's chowing down right now. As soon as i took her out of the carrying crate she pouncing the yeoww banana I had left out for her and went nuts. \n\nShe is a purr machine and loves for me to hold her. She's going to fit in just fine.",
