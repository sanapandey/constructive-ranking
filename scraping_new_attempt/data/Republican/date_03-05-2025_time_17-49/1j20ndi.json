Social media has been a way for soldiers to circumvent toxic CoCs and solve issues with all sorts of issues within the military. Social media has expanded the reach of our recruiting element, and develop a public face for the military. \n\n\nThe military isn\u2019t just some grunt with a rifle, there is a whole lot more involved. Logistics, Medical, Intelligence, Signal, Adjutant General, etc.. Space billets, instructor billets, public affairs billets. There is so much more than shooting at bad guys with guns to building an effective military \n\n\nI have the same opinion with the bands. That role has been in the US Army since 1775. Bands provide drill and ceremony. Bands build morale. That is an important component to the services. Good order and discipline is derived from tradition and good order and discipline enable combat effectiveness.\n\n\nRecruiting and retention drive our military, not whatever you consider \u201clethality\u201d to be.",
