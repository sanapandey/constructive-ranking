That is not to take anything away from the success he has had. He is a very intelligent and motivated person with high expectations.\n\nI think this is what happens when ego precedes technical capacity, planning, execution and testing. But he is not the only tech CEO to be guilty of this pattern. There have been plenty over the years.\n\nThis may also be a problem with his young and lesser experienced employees at DOGE. Experience in the tech business teaches you a lot about what NOT to do. Like setup a website and make it public without securing it first as being one of the most basic.\n\nIt is an embarrassment to the efforts of cleaning up government waste. We seriously need to clean up the federal spending BS. I am just not sure he is the right guy to be leading the effort.",
