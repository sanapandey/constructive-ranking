If it's a just peace, where Russia gives up much of the stolen land or Ukraine gets NATO membership or a similar defense pact, I'd be willing to admit I was wrong. If Ukraine is forced to give up land in exchange for Putin's pinky promise, then Trump will prove his detractors correct.",

Today I'm feeling like \"Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means\"\n\nI'll also use from the aforementioned speech, \"There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender\"\n\nA Ukrainian surrender is by no means just. And an unjust peace is akin to slavery. \"You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery\"\n\nIt's should be pretty obvious to anyone that some things are worth fighting for. Clearly to Ukraine their country is worth fighting for. Just as the US is to us.",

The war is ending and Ukraine is keeping its sovereignty. This is what we wanted, for Russia to go the fuck home. I get that there are positions Ukraine would benefit more from like admission to NATO but Jesus Christ these innocent people have been getting bombed, shot, stabbed, raped, tortured and worse for literal years now by a nuclear power and Trump is going to make it stop a month into his term. Biden burned billions of our fucking dollars and let Putin and his orc ass mother fuckers absolutely terrorize millions of people for YEARS.",

So many loves have been lost in Ukraine because of dumbass Russia, Biden, and some of his European friends. Only countries like Poland truly tried to help Ukraine win, but they are limited in what they can do because of limited resources.",
