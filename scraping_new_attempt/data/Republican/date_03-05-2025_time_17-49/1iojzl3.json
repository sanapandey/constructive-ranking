You are correct it is unsustainable, or another way to put it is if the only way to continue without addressing the spending problem is to print more money, then inflation will make us all poorer.  Hopefully, for future generations, we will not become another Weimar Republic.",

He absolutely has every intention of having his tax cuts extended. He also needs the funds for building detention centers.\n\nThe ONLY way to hold up both the promises of a lower national debt AND tax cuts for the top earners is to cut some military spending, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or social security (or all 4 programs), because even if you cut out ALL education (4% of federal spending) and USAID (1.2%)  programs, and NOAA (0.09%), you will STILL need to cut out huge swatches of every other program to meet the proposed Trump tax cuts (estimated to be $5 to $11 trillion per year. )\n\nBut, no worries, as there is a plan to even it out somewhat by removing long-standing tax breaks:\n\n* Mortgage interest deduction--This could either be cut entirely or lowered to a $500,000 cap, with the former idea saving $1 trillion over a decade and the latter $50 billion over the same period.\n\n* Head of household tax filing status--This filing status provides a larger standard deduction for unmarried adults with children. Eliminating it could save $192 billion over 10 years. \n\n* American Opportunity Credit--This $2,500 tax credit is given for educational expenses amassed over the first four years of a person's higher education. Revoking it would save $59 billion over a decade. \n\n\n* Child and Dependent Care tax credit--This credit helps families with young children pay for up to $2,100 in annual child care expenses. Waiving it would save $55 billion over a decade.\n\n\n* Student loan interest deduction--Scrapping this deduction, used by people with student loan debt, could save $50 billion over 10 years. \n\n\n* Lifetime Learning Credit--This nonrefundable tax credit is equal to 20% of qualified tuition and related expenses under $10,000. Repealing it would save $26 billion over 10 years. \n\nThe rest of this plan includes getting rid of other handouts:\n\n* Medicaid\n\n* Food stamps (SNAP benefits)\n\n* Headstart\n\nAnd additional taxes:\n\n* 10% tariffs on all imported goods (estimated to cost an average of $2,600 per family, for in increase tax revenue of $1.9 trillion.)\n\nObviously, for trickle down to work properly, we need to both DECREASE taxes on the top 1% of taxpayers, and INCREASE taxes on the bottom 50% of taxpayers. The more safety nets we can remove for the bottom 50%, the more MOTIVATED they will be to return to the office, work full time, and stop relying on handouts like healthcare discounts, food assistance and childcare assistance.",

            "body": "The problem is that the average voter doesn't want higher taxes or entitlement cuts, and thus they support raising the debt limit.  As a result, anyone who runs for office that doesn't support raising the ceiling are unlikely to get elected.\n\nAnother problem is that right now people don't see any negative ramifications from raising the limit.  As long as that perception holds, there isn't going to be support to address the issue.  Eventually, it will have negative effects but not for some time.  Here's a snippet from a US Treasury Dept report on fiscal sustainability:\n\n*A sustainable fiscal policy is defined as one where the debt-to-GDP ratio is stable or declining over the long term. The projections based on the assumptions in this\u00a0Financial Report\u00a0indicate that current policy is not sustainable. This Financial Report presents data, including debt, as a percent of GDP to help readers assess whether current fiscal policy is sustainable. The debt-to-GDP ratio was approximately 97 percent at the end of FY 2023, which is similar to (but slightly above) the debt to-GDP ratio at the end of FY 2022. If current policy is left unchanged and based on this\u00a0Financial Report\u2019s\u00a0assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to exceed 200 percent by 2047 and reach 531 percent in 2098.* \n\n[*https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/mda-unsustainable-fiscal-path.html*](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/mda-unsustainable-fiscal-path.html)",
