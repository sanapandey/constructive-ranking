            "body": "I'm not gonna defend the decision, I like the resettlement rule by Trump, but...\n\nExecutive order are not laws, our country was never designed to be ran by one person,asa matter of fact it was.designed to never be ran by one person.  We have a constitutional Republic ran by representative democracy.  That means that if you want a law you have to pass a law through congress and the executive branch enforced that law and the judiciary interprets and checks against it. \n\nWhat is going to piss a lot of people off from both parties is this simple fact. If you cannot pass these as a law through congress your political ideology is not popular enough.  You can shit in the Democrats for how dumb the bipartisan infrastructure bill was, but it was passed through congress.  That meant voters could then go to elect people based off the work they did or did not do for them.  And then Republicans were at ribbon cutting events for new jobs from it,it was good. \n\nIf Trump can't lead and pass these through congress they will continually get blocked as many of these are not well written, lack detail, specificity, and are not direct power of the president to make a lot of new rules that Congress and the judiciary have to oversee.  \n\nRemember last time when he had to rewrite a bunch of these because he lost in court and then was able to do them? He will get there.",
