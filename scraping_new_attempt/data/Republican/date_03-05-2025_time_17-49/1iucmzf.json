That being said, I dont hate American people, we are all the same in my book.\n\nSo, in the spirit of coming together, I would love to have a good old hockey banter with you all :-)\n\nIf USA win, then you will all be able to laugh at me into oblivion.  But if I win, I get bragging right!!\n\nWhat do you all think?  Should we have fun instead of hating each other?\n\nCheers you all, and as a Canadian, if you don't appreciate this post, Sorry ;-)",
