But after reports emerged on Wednesday of the potential for conflict of interest given Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s prominent role in the Trump Administration, the document was updated, removing mention of Tesla and changing the line item to \u201cArmored Electric Vehicles\u201d instead.\u2018\n\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is the State Department\u2019s document was originally published in 2024, before Trump took office. Do with that what you want. Just pointing that fact out.\n\n\nLink for article: https://time.com/7221880/state-department-2025-procurement-forecast-tesla-armored-electric-vehicles-musk/",

Again just my opinion. \n\nThe DOGE website shows contracts, which is great, but it doesn\u2019t show what the contract was for, other than the agency it was signed to. In an analogy, the mechanic is ripping stuff out from under the hood and you don\u2019t know what.\n\nMy second criticism is that we are not hearing where this recovered tax-payer money is going or being diverted too. But what we are hearing and experiencing is that Americans will have to endure \u201cshort term pain\u201d, meanwhile Trump suddenly wants to bring South African refugees here to the U.S. and the administration just ordered 400 million dollars worth of armored Teslas\u2026.\n\n(Look at the first 3 EPA contracts on the DOGE website\u2026.they recovered 135 million from somewhere in the EPA\u2026.but just spent 400 million on teslas\u2026that\u2019s almost 3X as much as they recovered from 3 contracts)\n\nAgain, I wouldn\u2019t say I have concern but being a critic\u2026it sounds like someone is benefitting quite a bit more than the American people that put them there.",

Then you have to pull back up for various transactions. Not everything is electronic. Then you have to ask questions as to why and how. You NEED to have employees there to ask them questions. You can't just fire everyone and then magically know where all the numbers came from and what they mean. \nAn audit isn't something you can just write a code for.\n\nSo to me something looks off.\n\nI'm also not a fan of firing 100s of people.

It\u2019s gonna be really wild when people figure out that all of the conspiracies turned out to be true. There are literally books explaining this entire process. It\u2019s wild watching the effects of brainwashed people once you realize you\u2019re being brainwashed. This definitely was not a kinetic war. It was an information war. The sooner people back up and start connecting dots the faster things will make sense. The amount of executions that are coming are going to be staggering. The amount of people arrested is going to be staggering. The liberals and the elite were doing everything in their power to completely kill the working class. If 97% of one particular government org was going to other countries. What do you THINK they thought was going to happen when someone found out.? It\u2019s mind blowing that people don\u2019t connect these dots ever.\nYou don\u2019t have to believe me you can go searching through my post or whatever you weirdos do. But for once I wish you would just stop put the computer down and think about it because it\u2019s very logical and it makes complete sense.

The need to make other countries into states or making contracts for Musk is not a good look. Butting into the middle east again doesn't seem like a good thing. All we should do is try to stop the fighting, not taking over more land there for ourselves. \n\nSome of Trump's decisions seem out of focus, I'd rather more effort start being put towards term limits on all government positions and Vance's proposal for making voting day a national holiday, same day results, and paper ballots only.
