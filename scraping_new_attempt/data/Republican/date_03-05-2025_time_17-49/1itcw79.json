Much wiser to pause everything and then specifically approve worthwhile programs aligned with the American people\u2019s mandate.\n\nBtw - accountants can play games with figures. Universities can make their overhead rates almost anything they want. Even if accurate, paying high overhead rates is funding inefficiency. Given that NIH has agreed to to fund a flat 15% and non-profit funding pays 15% or less, I\u2019m gobsmacked anyone is objecting\u2026",

Or whatever party.  \n\nWhat we have is a guy running wild through the government turning funding off instantly to various programs that may be beneficial because a bad one is connected to it somehow.  If there was proper oversight none of this would happen. \n\nYou have to remember that both Clinton and Obama proposed this wasteful spending cuts.  What happened was republicans ran around trying to cancel it, or set up oversight so that they could do exactly what I stated.  \n\nNow I am glad the GOP is finally coming around to this, but not glad that they lost the oversight portion.",

So - we have a problem with both parties, but we have an insane level from the Democrats.  Just look at all of the silliness of the Democrats defending waste fraud than abuse currently.",

Grant awards that have already been provisioned and approved should be allowed to continue and play out per the original promise.  In nearly all cases, the funding freeze is wasting even more $ by not allowing trials and other projects to complete.  Staff were hired and equipment and supplies purchased under a contracted promise.  Never before had we had to worry that the government wouldn\u2019t keep its word.  And to top it off, the courts agree!  It is illegal and this administration is not respecting the law. If we don\u2019t have that\u2014 what are we?  \n\nThe sane, ethical, and effective  approach would be to review all new funding announcements and pause the review and rewards cycle. The scientists would still be upset- but as a fellow scientist I could at least understand the approach.  Them\u2019s the breaks. \n\nFinally, the sad thing is that the amount of $ \u201csaved\u201d here is so small compared to the true deficit.  Maybe you saved the equivalent of 6 hours of debt payment.  There\u2019s a GOP senator with a ton of financial experience that regularly presents on this and has recently shown the pointlessness of what is being done.  \n\nThe subsequent messes with firing nuclear weapon specialists and bird flu experts (that now they are rehiring) just shows further that DOGE has a) no earthly idea what they are doing  and/or b) it\u2019s all lies to paw through the enormous amount of payments data for other purposes \n\nI used to be a consultant.

Treatment?  Ever evolving insulin therapies and medical devices to get just the smallest amount of drug at the right time.  Curing? Research (now at risk) is ongoing of how to try to stop the pancreas islet cell death whenever it starts and block whatever went nutty in the human immune system that decided the pancreas needed to die.  \n\nExcessive obesity in indigent counties that comes with heart disease and all that mess.  Research - study the root causes and it has been found that factors like no insurance coverage, having to work 2+ jobs with zero time for anything else, little to no transport options, and food deserts create a self-perpetuating cycle where people don\u2019t have access to time or the food to make better choices. Interventions: invest $ to develop local food / garden co-op\u2019s and let providers PRESCRIBE food.  Pay for bus routes and drivers to get people to the doctor for basic care before it gets out of hand.  It works.  But, since that involves often poor and historically disadvantaged people it\u2019s labeled as DEI nonsense and killed.\n\nAnd speaking of cures- some of the data coming back from new studies about the impact of drugs like Ozempic is amazing. Used correctly, it is curing alcoholism, addictive behaviors, and binge eating by regulating a hormone in the body that is just completely out of whack in so many people. Recent New England Journal of medicine studies have shown they are doing phenomenal things to turn around cardiovascular health for the better and save so much money in medical costs down the road.  \n\nMedical devices- my sister is a PhD robot scientist with funding from many different agencies (she works for an independent think tank research organization, and not a a university) and she develops those helmets You put on babies whose head bones aren\u2019t going to fuse together correctly.  She uses software, novel materials, and of course trials to to develop and iteratively improve the helmet so that they are maximally effective and you don\u2019t have side effects such as promoting excess rubbing pain or friction that can cause infections.   She also works to get the cost down on those devices.  That right there is a freaking cure!  But now her funding is at risk thanks to the doggie boys\n\nThose are just a few examples of what I think are pretty phenomenal research results that  translate into cures, extended life, and the ability to keep our workforce doing other things besides just being sick.",

It's way too small for a place that needs HIPPA-compliant IT systems, Pneumatic tube lines, house vacuum systems, and crap like that. Labs and medical facilities simply require more overhead. 15% indirect funding means that money has to come from someplace else, and it means a place is unsustainable in grants alone. It means research facilities are unsustainable without a secondary income stream. That splits their focus and reduces their efficiency. Cutting things that are waste is good, and some number between 15% and 50% is probably right, but 15% just seems low and will lead to more problems than it fixes.",
