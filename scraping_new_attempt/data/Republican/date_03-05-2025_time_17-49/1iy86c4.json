To vote with our brains and not our hearts.\n\nTo evaluate what each candidate really stands for, what their track records are, and what promises they have kept.  To look at their financial well-being and consider how it got that way.  Are they serving us, or serving themselves, or, like some female non-native born members of Congress, are they serving other governments?\n\nThese are but a few things to be considered before the next round of marking your ballots.  Hopefully, the mandate that put President Trump will carry on and allow us to get rid of the greedy, arrogant, self-aggrandizing members of the Deep State.",
