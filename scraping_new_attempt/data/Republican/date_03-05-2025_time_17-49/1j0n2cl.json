This is not good for humanity and shows that clearly, it is a power struggle as peace takes away all opportunities for imperialism. \n\nAlso during the meeting.

Not issues you may have but here we go. \n\nBending over to Russia - we have made no deals with Russia, are actively fighting them in a war, but if you expect insults to be used in a peace talk. You are mistaken to think that will have a positive impact.\n\nObjectively, I have not seen evidence of this. Just in the recent meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump stated, he would continue to provide armaments to Ukraine if peace is not met. That definitely sounds anti Russia. I mean we are at war with them lol. \n\nCutting funding to the NPS - Non profit organizations are being stopped from accessing the NPS\u2019s funds. Probationary employees were put in a hiring freeze. \n\nThis was done so quickly, a number of employees have been rehired AND the National Park Service has already released a statement announcing their hiring of nearly 8000 seasonal employees this year. Not only has this saved money, created more opportunity, but it has also already ran its course. There was no harm done. \n\nObjectively, this was sketchy to watch take place. Overall, it has a net positive. \n\nConstant threats to annex Canada - annoying, yes. Going to happen? Impossible. \n\nBut what is the purpose? It has been explicitly stated that the tariff and threats of annexation are because of the illicit drugs crossing our northern border. \n\nNot only has this added immense pressure to Canada, but it has worked. \n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-agency/news/2025/02/cbsa-launches-operation-blizzard-to-target-fentanyl-and-other-synthetic-narcotics.html\n\nOther than being annoying, I don\u2019t see how this is objectively bad. It objectively is a net positive for all involved parties. \n\nTariff causing gas to be expensive - WE HAVE THE CHEAPEST GAS SINCE THE END OF 2020! The tariff did nada nothing. \n\nGas hasn\u2019t dropped more in price because winter lasted longer than usual. It just snowed in Florida. Don\u2019t forget just in 2022, gas was ALMOST FIVE DOLLARS. \n\nObjectively, tariff has had near no impact. All the while bringing proven positives. Gas will always go up and down. The US Energy Information Administration released a statement describing how it won\u2019t have impact and especially not long term impact. This statement was agreed upon by respected groups such as Goldman Sachs and other economic institutions. \n\nBuilding a massive trump resort - that\u2019s one way to look at it. That also, is not even close to the reality of the situation. Egypt and Jordan would be very involved in the real life plans. Just reddit memes. \n\nBut I would rather you hear what he actually said the plan is. Go 1hour and 16mins to 1hour and 20mins. He\u2019s said a ton. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/3u97KlTvpic?si=O-jVI6s57joLw1U-\n\nObjectively, this is a positive for the neighboring nations and Gaza as a historical region. The finished construction with the collaboration of said neighboring countries is the only option. Go on Google earth. There are no buildings there anymore the people fighting for control, can\u2019t afford to rebuild it. \n\nI mean, do you think it would be better to leave the rubble and do nothing? Lol?",
