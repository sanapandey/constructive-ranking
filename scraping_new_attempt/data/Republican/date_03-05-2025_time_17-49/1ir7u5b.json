    "selftext": "We have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted. You'll have to excuse my boomerishness, but with New Reddit and some other changes (I still prefer Old Reddit) some of what we used to do has shifted. Some of these thing I think can be coded, but I am learning how. Again, forgive my ignorance.\n\nAnyway, one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos, text posts, and image posts, if unchecked, were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us, but also intended to get us shut down. If some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we weren't diligent enough in taking them down, the sub could get shut down. \n\nThat is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception, and it remained an unspoken rule. But things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made, and then new reddit happened and we mods just didn't adjust to the times perhaps? That's my excuse anyway.\n\nPeople started posting links in text posts, which I thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it, but it was just a pain in the ass. They started posting text commentary under articles, which never used to happen.\n\nSo the issue is thus: too little oversight into posts leads to\n\n* Shit posts (And I mean shit)\n* Trolls having too easy a time to troll\n* Bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users.\n\nThese new rules are to force commentary where it belongs, in the comment section. If you want to make a comment about your article, just make it in the comment section, don't change the title to comment on an article, and don't comment on the article in any body section (I think I changed that so you won't be able to).\n\n**Forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the** ***same*** **commentary**. So do not complain about free speech on this front. Protestors have to follow rules, too, they are supposed to get permits, they are not allowed to just disrupt everything... at least anywhere other than blue cities.\n\nThis also prevents an annoying trend I've been seeing where users post a link to Google. Not a Google article. Not some app on Google to comment on the app in some relevant way, just posting a link to Google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post.\n\nHopefully I have removed that ability so the rule is moot.\n\nWe also hope to allow more things like text posts, video posts, and other posts. But that requires moderation. I can't tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll, brigade, and try to hurt us. An innocuous photo of Trump and the First Lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of Melania's dress or Trump's tie (I forget which). It was a troll post.\n\nThere may be setting changes to do some of this automatically (and I think there are, but I'm new to this part of moderating) so the rule doesn't even matter because it won't be possible to break these rules.\n\nThat said, I would also like you to know WHY we limit the kinds of posts we allow.",
