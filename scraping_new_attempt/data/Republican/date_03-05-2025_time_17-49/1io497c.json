            "body": "(From the article) New York has a \u2018green light\u2019 law that allows illegal aliens in the state to evade ID checks if law enforcement pulls them over, Bondi said. It prohibits police and other agencies like the DMV from sharing data with federal authorities for purposes of immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cThey have a \u2018tip-off\u2019 provision that requires New York\u2019s DMV commissioner to promptly inform any illegal alien when a federal immigration agency has requested their information,\u201d Bondi further explained. \u201cIt\u2019s tipping off an illegal alien. And it\u2019s unconstitutional, and that\u2019s why we filed this lawsuit.\u201d(End of article)\n\n\u2014-\nSuddenly, this lawsuit makes a lot more sense. It\u2019s a federal charge against a state for harbouring illegals and giving those illegals advanced warning to get outta dodge before law enforcement shows up. \n\nThis is just reprehensible.",
