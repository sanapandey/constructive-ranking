                                    "body": "Nah, Hamas is pretty skilled at propaganda as well, they've managed to trick the younger Millenials, most of Gen Z, and the older Gen Alpha that \"palestine\" was there first, even though Israelis lived in Israel for thousands of years before the Arabs ever came to \"palestine\". \n\n\nIn fact, the only reason the war is happening right now is because Jews were kicked out by the Romans in 135 AD. Then the Romans were kicked out by the Arab Muslim conquerors. And about 1000 years after that, Jews were told to \"go back where they came from\". Now they did. But of course the Arab Muslims don't like that, even though the Arab Muslims aren't even from \"palestine\" in the first place. \n\nSo now Hamas is actively trying to rewrite history and brainwash our youth into thinking that the \"palestinians\" where there first, even though they weren't. I've literally seen so many brainwashed idiots on Instagram say that Jesus was \"palestinian\", even though the name \"palestine\" didn't even exist until 135 AD when the Romans kicked the Jews out (\"Syria Palestinia\"), as I mentioned before. I also saw a post claiming that Christmas originated in \"palestine\". One again, it did not. Jesus was an Israeli Jew; and Christmas was started in Israel.",

No doubt that college professors who are supposed to be teaching history teach the altered version of history that the Arab Msulims created. \n\nAnd speaking of which, on a side tangent, on TikTok I found an account that had posts claiming Muslims discovered America first, and their \"evidence\" is \"infrastructural similarities\" between Middle Eastern and Southwest American houses, Mayan glyphs that they claimed are \"Arabic\", and a bunch of other bullshit that their only proof of is word of mouth, no actual solid evidence. I also saw a Muslim claim that the Confederate flag was inspired by the Moor flag, when it wasn't. Absolutely NOTHING to do with Moors or Muslims. Muslims (most likely the Fundamentalist ones, because I've interacted with Muslims who weren\u2019t completely nuts) just seem have a strange fascination with trying to rewrite history to fit their agenda. The history of Israel is just one of many things that Jihadist Fundamentalist Neo Nazi terrorist groups like Hamas are trying to rewrite the history of.",
