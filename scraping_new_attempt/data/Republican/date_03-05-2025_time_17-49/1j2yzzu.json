How long until there aren\u2019t enough Ukrainians to win despite the money and weapons we give them and we have to send our own troops? This Republican and veteran is against continuing our history of endless war. The best thing we can do for Ukraine is to help end the war peacefully. Zelenskyy doesn\u2019t want that.",
