And these two are clearly left wing partys with the Greens being the more radical think AOC kinda stupid.\n\nAlso these \"Conservatives\" are the reason germany is being flooded with Migrants since 2015 they brought them in and procceded to do nothing about it, only recently they choose it as a topic to campaign on with the goal of getting Afd voters back.\n\nYou probably have seen the clips from the american news channel that was following german police and raiding and arresting citizens for posting mean memes online. That law comes from these \"conservatives\".\n\nThey are nothing but a Balloon full of hot air. Now I'd like to be suprised but I cant see how they want to restrict mass Migration when forming a goverment with leftists.",

In many cases, wanting less red tape can be about making the democratic process more efficient and transparent.\n\nHowever, when a party or politician repeatedly undermines core democratic institutions, like the free press or the judicial system, by labeling them as fundamentally corrupt or illegitimate, it starts crossing the line from simply being \u201canti bureaucracy\u201d. These institutions aren\u2019t just random layers of red tape. They\u2019re pillars that keep the system balanced. If you consistently discredit the watchdogs and referees (media, courts, independent agencies), you risk paving the way for unchecked power.\n\nSo yeah, \u201canti bureaucracy\u201d by itself doesn\u2019t mean \u201canti democracy,\u201d but if the criticism is broadly aimed at *all* government institutions, then people have a valid concern that it\u2019s shifting from \u201cless paperwork\u201d to questioning democracy\u2019s core principles.",
