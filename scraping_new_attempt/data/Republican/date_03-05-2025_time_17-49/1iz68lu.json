And somehow Harley Davidson motorcycles became a huge part of that.\n\n10 years later we found out that most of the parts were manufactured in Mexico, same with Ford, Chrysler etc.\n\nTrump is creating a NEED to manufacture in America and he is also leveling the playing field by raising costs of foreign manufacturing.",
