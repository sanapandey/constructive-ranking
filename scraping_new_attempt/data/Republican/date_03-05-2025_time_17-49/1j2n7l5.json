Putin is definitely the central issue but there is no easy or safe way to get rid of him. All we can do is play the cards we have, but Zelenskyy wants to turn this into a global war against Russia. That\u2019s just insane, that\u2019s what we have been trying to avoid for almost 100 years.",

At the beginning of the war USA offered him asylum. Instead he said \u2018I need ammunition. not a ride\u2019. This, when tanks were surrounding his capital city? This is a guy we should support. \n\nRussia has threatened nuclear war since literally 1949 when they got the weapon. Never before has the west shrank from that threat\u2026why? Because we have them too. They didn\u2019t use them when they lost Afghanistan, they won\u2019t use them now. If they do, that\u2019s on them. Maybe stop invading countries and annexing. This is the lesson of ww2.  No more annexations. \n\nYou can\u2019t just start letting them take whatever territory they want because of the threat of nukes.  If you do, they literally retake all of ussr because you are afraid they\u2019ll nuke if they don\u2019t. Get a grip.",

If we directly get involved then things will get worse. Maybe that is the right thing to do, maybe in the long run it would be better to take Russia head on, but you can\u2019t blame Trump for not wanting to drag us into that ether. As for him being a guy we want to support, I don\u2019t know. The more I watch him the more he seems like a slimy con artist to me. That whole \u201cI don\u2019t need asylum I need ammo\u201d thing seems more like a PR stunt than anything. He is a performer and he knew dork day one that this would be a PR game. He plays the hero and celebrity but there are some good reasons to question his motives. He has suspended elections, banned opposing political parties, arrested political opponents and a lot of money has gone missing which at least warrants suspension. \n\nThis fall into the two things can be true. I don\u2019t like or trust Putin but that doesn\u2019t make me automatically trust or like Zelenskyy.",

If he loses, especially in early days, Russia takes over the largest country in Europe. They put in the constitution suspension of elections exactly for this scenario - Russia can\u2019t be allowed to invade and then dictate election results, it would be an \u2018election\u2019 like they have In Russia\u2026are those free and fair?

I know it\u2019s very frustrating but I think the point is Zelenskyy is getting in the way of his own progress here.\n\nUkraine is in an awful spot which you recognize. What do you propose then the US do differently? No president leading up to and since the war began, has offered a solid resolution so far. The only thing (and you\u2019re not the first one) is to continue a status quo for supplying Ukraine. At the rate they are going they will lose this war and then what? Would it have been all in vein? UK and NATO is in agreement this is a far better and less evasive resolution.\n\nEven Obama\u2019s staff recognized this early on. There will be tales of triumph and heroism for the ages for Ukraine soldiers who serve. Won\u2019t serve them any good if they are captured by Russia. Nobody wants that outcome on this side of the Western hemisphere.\n\nI think your emotions and frustrations while understandable are more in line with Zelenskyy\u2019s. Major difference is he\u2019s the leader of Ukraine you\u2019re like the rest of us a Redditor. Trump\u2019s response is a \u201cwake-up call\u201d that Zelenskyy needs to get on board otherwise he won\u2019t have a country left. Or worse, they do drag us into a World War and they will be obliterated. As the entire country would become a battlefield. Once again, no one on the Western Hemisphere wants that. It is unacceptable.\n\nZelenskyy by the way was the original proposer of the [minerals deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn527pz54neo.amp) this past fall knowing if Trump was elected this was the framework for a peace agreement to begin.\n\nThe issue here is Zelenskyy\u2019s vagueness of a \u201csecurity guarantee\u201d. He would love NATO membership. Nobody wants that except Ukraine. It\u2019s not happening. So what does he want instead. He said \u201c\u2026something similar\u201d. The \u201csecurity deal\u201d is preventing Russia from taking Ukraine\u2019s resources and instead creating a US business partnership in lieu. So that Russia cannot harvest Ukraine\u2019s resources \u201cat will\u201d.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/world/europe/us-ukraine-minerals-deal-security.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare",

I hope we\u2019re in agreement on that too.\n\nThe only option other than coming up with another deal is to start the third world war. If any allied countries get boots on ground, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s time to suit up. That would cause an astronomical amount of deaths. A world war with current technology would be devastating on a level we\u2019ve never seen before. The ONLY viable solution is to have Ukraine come up with a ceasefire. Zelensky isn\u2019t winning this thing. So prolonging it like he is, is just getting more people killed. Yes, it\u2019s unfair, because Putin is the aggressor, but Putin will not back down, he will go to world war if he has to.\n\nI also want to remind you, Ukraine isn\u2019t an ally. Yes, they\u2019re the \u201cgood guys\u201d in this specific situation, but they are not allied to us. We shouldn\u2019t jump to bat for them on the same level we would for, say Poland or Germany. They wouldn\u2019t do the same for us. Ukraine is lucky that we are willing to play the middle man and prevent Putin from taking more of their land. We don\u2019t have to do shit. Coming up with a deal to start a ceasefire is the BEST case scenario here, it prevents the most deaths and it brings the situation as close as it can to world peace.",

Speakers included Secretary of the Ukrainian National Security Council Volodymyr Horbulin, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer, U.S. Principal Deputy to the Ambassador-at-Large for the New Independent States Ross Wilson, the chairman of the British parliamentary committee on national security, and Sergei Karaganov, a leading Russian expert on foreign policy who is now a close adviser to Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOne could argue that the goal of such a conference sponsored by the American embassy was to promote NATO expansion, particularly to urge Ukraine to join the Western alliance. But that is not how I remember it. Typically, U.S. government public diplomacy like this does not bluntly advocate, but rather presents information or views that would be new to our local audiences. A more forceful NATO appeal for membership for Eastern European countries, including Ukraine, emerged from the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008.\n\nAt our conference on NATO in 1999, divergent views were expressed, but there was no outright opposition. The Western speakers tended to celebrate NATO\u2019s notable success at keeping Europe at peace since the end of World War II. Even Karaganov, with close ties to the then-leadership, President Boris Yeltsin, did not raise a red flag. The Russian leadership did, however, object strongly to encroachments on Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. This was also the decade in which NATO was promoting the \u201cPartnership for Peace\u201d for coordination with NATO programs and possible eventual membership. At the time of the conference, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were all on the verge of becoming NATO members, the first of 14 former Soviet-dominated countries that would eventually join the alliance.\n\n\n\nThe Issue of NATO Expansion\n\nTwenty-three years later, President Putin has made Ukraine\u2019s preliminary steps to joining NATO the principal grounds for the Russian invasion of Feb. 24, 2022. The alliance\u2019s leaders have always made clear that it is up to each European country to make its own decision about membership. But the eastward expansion of NATO particularly inflamed Putin, who has claimed that Secretary of State James Baker and other Western leaders assured Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, at the time a unified Germany joined NATO, that the alliance would expand \u201cnot one inch eastward.\u201d\n\nGeorge Kennan would surely have understood Putin\u2019s reaction. The architect of the \u201ccontainment\u201d policy toward the Soviet Union wrote in 1997 that \u201cexpanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post\u2013Cold War era.\u201d Kennan continued: \u201cSuch a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East-West relations; and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.\u201d\n\nPutin believes that Russia rightfully deserves a sphere of influence in its \u201cnear abroad.\u201d\nKennan never convinced President Bill Clinton or his Russia adviser, Strobe Talbott. And the remarks of Secretary Baker or NATO leaders could be discounted because they were never part of a treaty or formal agreement. But Putin nevertheless claims that the West betrayed Russia in the post-Soviet period because much of Eastern Europe, in fact, joined NATO. And this is at least part of what motivates his aggression now.\n\nIn any case, this putative betrayal does not carry the weight of a violation of a formal agreement, a violation of which Putin himself is guilty. By signing the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994, the Russian Federation promised not to threaten or use military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. As a result of this and other agreements, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons and acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. It is now paying the price for trusting Russia to honor its international commitments.\n\nShift in Ukrainian Public Opinion\n\nDuring my tenure in Kyiv, State Department\u2013sponsored public opinion polling never showed a majority of Ukrainian public support for NATO membership. Private sector polling showed that as late as 2012, only 28 percent of Ukrainians wished to join NATO. Not surprisingly, pro-Russian sentiment was stronger in the east, but the largest plurality was for neutrality. The 2014 Russian seizure of Crimea and the fomenting of a violent separatist movement in eastern Ukraine sharply shifted Ukrainian public opinion. A poll by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation in June 2017 found 69 percent supported joining the alliance.\u201d\n\nThe rest is very informative, but I\u2019ll leave it at this. \n\n[source](https://afsa.org/about-afsa)",

Following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, media highlighted new reports of Russian forces using Ukrainian children as human shields. Observers also reported Russian authorities used Ukrainian children as informants to gather information about the location of strategic military objects, such as checkpoints and transportation routes, and used Russian children, including orphans and children with disabilities, to sew clothes and bandages for Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine and to make tactical stretchers, mobile stoves, and trench candles. Russian authorities expanded efforts to militarize Russian children and Ukrainian children in Russia-occupied territory in Ukraine. The government publicly announced there were approximately 10,000 \u201cmilitary-patriotic\u201d clubs in Russian schools, and the Ministry of Education reportedly announced it piloted a mandatory course in schools that included classes on drones, practice using live ammunition, and excursions to military units. Observers reported Russia-associated military associations and clubs, registered as non-profit organizations, continued to routinely prepare Ukrainian youth in Russia-occupied areas of Ukraine for conscripted service in Russia\u2019s armed forces; some observers reported Russia-led forces conscripted Ukrainian youth as young as 16 years old, some of whom may have participated in fighting. In February 2024, observers reported Russia-led forces created new camps for Ukrainian children in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine, where Russian-occupation authorities taught children to use firearms. In November 2023, Russia-led forces announced a new \u201cprofessional military orientation\u201d for students in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Experts reported Russian authorities placed thousands of Ukrainian children in \u201cre-education\u201d camps in Belarus, Russia, and Russia-occupied territory in Ukraine; in some cases, instruction included military education and training. All children placed in these camps remained vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including human trafficking. As in previous reporting periods, the government provided support to the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, an armed group that unlawfully recruited and used child soldiers in the Central African Republic (CAR). Media previously reported the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group kidnapped boys in CAR and exploited them in forced labor in mines.\n\n[source](https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-trafficking-in-persons-report/russia/)",

More defense contracts, tech innovations, and energy partnerships have boosted your companies. We are all interconnected, and we must stand firm against aggressors.",

Many in NATO have lived under a US Security Umbrella and didnt meet their military obligations. Is NATO outside of the US a capable fighting force? Without US Logistical help could European NATO allies get troops to the Baltics? Many of these issues Trump highlighted in his first presidency and NATO and EU countries laughed at him. Had the EU been more of a credible military threat Russia probably doesnt invade. \n\nIf Europe was actually concerned about their own security instead of as the Polish PM said having 500 Million Europeans ask 300 Million Americans to defend them against 150 Million Russians things probably go different. The EU should have read the tea leaves after the disastrous Afghan pullout that the US was war weary and should have asked themselves if they were prepared to lead in the defense of Europe and not have America setting their security policy.",

The US want to performatively help Ukraine by providing just enough resources to bleed Russia but ultimately Ukraine will lose more of its country if a ceasefire isnt achieved. \n\nThe US under Biden didn't actually care if Russia won because if we did we would have from day 1 handed over as much aid as possible instead we drip fed the Ukrainians more and more equipment that was slightly better under the guise of not wanting to antagonize Putin and escalate the war.  \n\n  \nTwenty years of war should have taught us one thing and that is do not half heartedly commit to war. Fully commit to winning the war as fast as possible to end the suffering or do not go at all. Half measures only prolong the death and destruction of nations.

The whole point of this recent meeting was to negotiate mineral extraction from Ukraine by the US, which was a roundabout way of securing some sort of incentive for Russia not to invade Ukraine again without having the political risks of WW3 (NATO/US troop security mobilization is a red line for Russia, mineral extraction would be a way to ensure some safety of Ukraine)\n\nZelensky is essentially discrediting any potential ceasefire deals with Russia by saying what he had said in the meeting and in this. It makes things harder for the USA to help make a deal especially when Ukraine is so shut off to the idea.\n\nWhat Zelensky seems to not understand is- If the war continues for too long, Ukraine will absolutely lose. Russia hasn\u2019t yet taken advantage of its millions of troops (still has a lot of citizens it can conscript) at its disposal, or significant military equipment (Weapons capable of large scale destruction, including but not limited to nuclear weapons). Ukraine can only defend itself, and cannot provide any sort of offense. Eventually they will exhaust the rest of their soldiers, leaving them with almost nothing to fight with. For Ukraine\u2019s continued existence, some sort of agreement would have to come about with Russia. And it most certainly would benefit Russia more than Ukraine, due to the nature of the situation. (I.E. would likely have to do with Russia keeping parts of captured territory).\n\nAnd most of us want Ukraine to continue to exist for obvious reasons. If it is captured by Russia, it paves way for continued Russian imperialism. It is in our best interest to keep it existing, but it is also in our best interest to end the war not only so Ukraine doesn\u2019t fall, but also so we can stop such an expensive war.

You can look at the depletion of their soviet stockpiles, loss of the black sea fleet, degredation of their capabilities in syria to the point they lost it, dramatic decrease of CO2 emissions, use of north korean troops, loss of swaths of the kursk region, the rout from the kyiv and kharkiv regions, to mention nothing of the use of crutchnik waves. Russia is not the soviet union.\n\nI want to touch on the nuclear war statement too, is this to say that any nuclear capable nation has a carte blanche to do whatever they want? If that is the case, it alters the geopolitical game to favor nuclear powers so heavily that we'll see nuclear proliferation be the only winning play. Suddenly the odds of nuclear war go through the roof simply by saturation.",

If that really was part of the original deal in 1990, then I can understand why Putin is pissed off. As are other leaders in Russia.\n\nNow I just need to find a way to cite that original deal because people love to follow up with the word: LINK? I don't have it. I've just heard it repeated on a few news sources. If someone can provide a link to that original treaty the USA signed with Russia, I would appreciate it.\n\nRemember this much: America has never been invaded in our lifetimes. Nor in the lifetimes of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents. My mother lived through the *fear* of invasion following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I remember questioning her about it when I was a kid in the 1970's. I have never forgotten the shock of seeing this fear in her older eyes. She was just a teenager when Pearl Harbor happened. Despite the passage of decades since that moment, the fear never left her. It was still there.\n\nMy point is this: Russia *HAS* been invaded. Millions of Russians *DIED*. That fear of foreign invasion is very real. It affects you. It affects decisions that are made to prevent such a thing from ever happening again.",

But it also makes sense for them to be open to peace even if they could keep going. My understanding is that they currently control land access to Crimea so a status quo peace allows them to consolidate their acquisition of Crimea. A status quo ante-bellum is highly unlikely unless they are pushed out of this territory",

All they talk about is how Brexit killed the UK economy and he's going to give $5B. UK has to be wondering where that money is coming from. Then, the threat of sending troops and planes to fight just to try to get NATO involved. Trump should release a statement that it's beyond foolish and wound end the United States membership if they provoke a NATO war with Russia.\n\nEurope / NATO wants to act big and bad when the United States does all of the heavy lifting.

No matter how much support the US and EU give, unless they actually send troops (and cause WW3), they can't win. \n\nThe mineral deal was/is a good proposal. It gives a non-military US presence in the contested area, which basically forces Putin to back off. It's a reasonable way to thank the US for all the support (if you ask me), and it could lay the foundation for a path to Ukraine joining NATO and/or the EU formally. \n\nI think Zelenskyy is beyond the point of wanting peace, though.
