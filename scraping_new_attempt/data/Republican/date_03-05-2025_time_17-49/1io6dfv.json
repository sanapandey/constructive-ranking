            "body": "The OP is a concern troll. They have been making posts that attempt to challenge our views (or really stick it to us with \"gotcha\" posts) because the OP is a pathetic, passive aggressive troll. Concern troll posts are designed to put you back on your heals and make you angry with your side. They benefit from the fact that the media is still largely controlled by the left ao the articles will omit information that will make this headline seem more reasonable.\n\nThe post is staying though. It is good to know these things. For those of you who believe this is conflict of interest, I have heard that this contract was drafted during the Biden administration. But Google doesn't allow me to search articles within a time range through an advanced search on my phone. If someone could please do that, that would be great. The article makes it sound like this was just created but these deals typically take a while. It sounds like Trump is just giving the final approval?\n\nBut regardless, $400 million is not all that much for such a contract. Also Musks products are the best in the industry and most cost efficient on the market, and their trucks already are made with bullet resistant glass and body.\n\nYou can be critical of this contract but just know that a concern troll is trying to stick it to you and that there is more to the story. Don't be immediately outraged, that's what these pathetic trolls want.",
