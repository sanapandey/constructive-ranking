Till then it's up to the courts to decide and set precident.  \n\nWhich in all likelihood the court will side with Trump and we can all move in from this incredibly fucking dumb argument that may not even have any active cases of in Maine.",

The 1984 Minimum Drinking Age Act withheld federal funds for highway money if states didn't move their driving age to 21. South Dakota sued, it went to The Supreme Court and in a 7-2 ruling upheld the law. The major difference was the drinking age law came out of Congress and this comes from the EO, but the Title IX stuff is Congressional.",
