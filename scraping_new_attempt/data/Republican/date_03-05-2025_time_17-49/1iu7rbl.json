A subset of that is Evangelical.\n\nThat being said, they are not the same, but they are \"in the same boat\" in my opinion, with large groups of religious nutjobs (including my mother) who struggle to understand anything outside the context of being spoonfed religious propaganda.\n\nThis is not necessarily for all Catholics, or even all Evangelicals. It's just a large enough subset that it screws up everything else around it, and politicians pander to the loudest voices in the room, which in the particular instance, would be those religious nutjobs. It's the same issue in pretty much every religion. However, Republicans especially outdo themselves by BS'ing their way into the \"good graces\" of the religious groups within the US. They have Mormons and Evangelicals at the moment, and they're working on the Jewish and Catholic angle right now.\n\nIf it weren't for the Republicans pandering to the religious nuts out there, my resident state of Virginia would have been deep red for a lot longer than it has been, and have no risk of turning blue.",
