                    "body": "Yeah. You're reading this way too superficially. That's how public perception can become a negative factor in all of this. Even Trump admitted this is going to be, \"...great television...\". Because he's well aware of the optics that transpired.\n\nThe minerals deal here allows a business mutualism that would allow the US to be invested and offer a sort of economic reassurance that increases the value and importance of Ukraine to the West. It is not the solution but, the prospect of making the US and Ukraine have a stronger trade relationship. Which increases the US willingness, in the future, to protect them. It holds strategic economic value interests. Otherwise, it's a tough sell towards our interests.\n\nRemember, no NATO ally has been vocal about the Ukranian NATO membership. As NATO considers them to have a 'fragile democracy' even before the invasion. The offer is suggesting that Ukraine can become a more formidable nation and then be able to stand stronger against adversaries. This is just a token gesture to start that level of diplomacy and going forward. You need to start somewhere.  \n  \nHowever, as some have said already. Realize President Zelensky has already taken massive casualties (as have the Russian military) and will continue to do so. The big question is we saw President Obama not take an aggressive stance after Crimea annexation. \n\nIn a 2014 quote from Obama about Ukraine:  \n\n\n>\"was not the Ukraine we are talking about today\".  \n\n\n>\"There is a reason\u00a0**why there was not an armed invasion of Crimea.**\u00a0Because Crimea was full of Russian speakers, and there was some sympathy to the view that Russia was representing its interest. The Rada \\[Ukrainian parliament \u2013 ed.\\] at the time still had a number of Russian sympathizers. The politics inside Ukraine were more complicated,\"\n\nAdditionally, it was only until Trump became president that he began to increase arms sales to Ukraine (refer to Trump's Javelin reference). Something that Biden then, eventually, continued once the invasion began.\n\nI hate to say this but while our media will fire up on all cylinders to make Trump look bad, this hurt Zelensky more so and his own people. He has that obligation to his people. Especially since he's always showing face during the war to his soldiers and citizens. But as this has been mentioned, he also lowered the conscripting age of his own people since last April due to losses.\n\nAs emotionally frustrating as it is, I would turn some of these questions back to you. Do you think the US should be directly involved? Do you believe that Ukrainian strength will overcome Russia without US/European interventionism alone? Is the US carte blanche to Ukraine?",

What Ukraine does in its borders with its laws are none of our concern, but Trump wants to be remembered as this Peacemaker and this is his moment when he has the trifrecta in DC to get some thing done before the Democrats retake one branch of congress and stifle any more of his efforts.",
