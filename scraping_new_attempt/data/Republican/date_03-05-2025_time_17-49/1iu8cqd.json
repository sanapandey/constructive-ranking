Just had a 90 minute course where the whole thing was giving shitty examples of trump. Wish I could speak out on this bs cause it is obvious they are trying to push this liberal agenda on students but it would definitely affect my grade.

Over decades, higher education expanded and evolved in ways that attracted liberal-minded individuals (and discouraged many conservatives), leading to a self-reinforcing leftward tilt in faculty ideology\u200b [nas.org](https://www.nas.org/articles/Why_Are_Most_College_Professors_Liberal_New_Studies_Investigate#:~:text=explanations%20is%20to%20be%20found,debates%20in%20contemporary%20higher%20education)\u200b[insidehighered.com](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/03/21/liberal-academic-self-selection#:~:text=among%20professors%20is%20the%20result,focused%20on%20the%20United%20States). This trend has been amplified by the correlation between advanced education and liberal values, and by formative events such as the fights against McCarthy-era repression and the social movements of the 1960s, which linked academia to progressive causes. As a result, by the 21st century the professoriate leans decisively left-of-center \u200b[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_American_academics#:~:text=Smaller%20follow,13)\u200b[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_American_academics#:~:text=described%20themselves%20as%20far%20left,28). In the case of Donald Trump, this liberal academic majority \u2013 joined by numerous moderate and even conservative professors \u2013 found itself **strongly at odds with the President**. Trump\u2019s policies on science, immigration, and education, as well as his confrontational, anti-intellectual rhetoric, clashed with academia\u2019s evidence-based, globally minded, and pluralistic values \u200b[insideclimatenews.org](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22042017/march-for-science-scientists-climate-change-donald-trump-climate-denial/#:~:text=with%20the%20policies%20of%20the,Trump%20administration)\u200b[insidehighered.com](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/30/higher-education-leaders-denounce-trumps-travel-ban#:~:text=Many%20higher%20education%20leaders%20issued,many%20cases%2C%20expressed%20moral%20outrage). Consequently, many professors were vocal critics of Trump, defending principles of truth, expertise, and openness that they felt were under siege. In summary, the predominance of liberal views among professors stems from both who enters academia and how academic culture has developed, and this ideological character has shaped professors\u2019 responses to political leaders \u2013 with the Trump era being a notable example of academia mobilizing in defense of its core ideals.\u200b [nas.org](https://www.nas.org/articles/Why_Are_Most_College_Professors_Liberal_New_Studies_Investigate#:~:text=explanations%20is%20to%20be%20found,debates%20in%20contemporary%20higher%20education)\u200b[insidehighered.com](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/30/higher-education-leaders-denounce-trumps-travel-ban#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20order%20must%20be%20rescinded%2C,behind%20it%20must%20be%20named%C2%A0%E2%80%A6)",

Universities and professors rely on funding and grants from national science organizations, which all contain an agenda. (NHS, WHO, NOAA etc) The funding will usually only be given if said research proposal aligns with the agenda. In addition, good luck publishing and getting noticed for said research if it doesn\u2019t follow the narrative.\n\nProfessors(majority) and universities seem to be brainwashed by this system today unfortunately.",
