Not even the Germans really care about that. \nIt's just like when Elon and Vance showed their support for a pro Russian German political party. They may like them or not, but why do they waste their energy and put more strain on transatlantic relations to support a political party that is anti American, anti globalist and pro Russian in a country that is not America.",

Germany is not like Russia. (And all the other democracies that have similar limitations to free speech aren't like Russia either.)",

Why can he not advocate for fair and equal democratic participation? If the people choose a party that\u2019s favorable to Russia it\u2019s not their right to suppress them. Suppressing the opposition makes them no better than Russia.\n\nDude there was literally just a report showing German police raiding homes of people that criticized their leaders. How did you miss that???\n\nEdit: and they also made it our problem when European countries started threatening to charge AMERICANS with these thought crimes and petitioning for their extradition to stand trial. Fuck. That. Shit. Fascist",

Russia is the dominant power in a lot of barely inhabited tundra in northern Asia. There is no reason for a bargain. Russia has nothing to offer to the US and they wouldn't have any power in Europe at all if Trump wouldn't hand it over to them. Russia isn't the Soviet Union and even the USSR wasn't very impressive. But today's Russia doesn't even have the political bloc power the USSR has had. They are completely dependent on China's goodwill and are mostly isolated politically. Russians aren't welcome in so many countries that they start to vacation in North Korea. It's crazy to think the US would need Russia for anything.",

The only thing you said there that I totally support is that Russia is an authoritarian state. You know what? The US isn't. America is a Democracy and it will stay one. No one wants to give up their freedom and the only people who really believe that Trump is going to turn the US into an authoritarian state are crazy libs with paranoia.\n\n>It's pretty simple.  The current governments of France and Germany and the rest support Biden, NATO, and the globalist neoliberal consensus, and so are enemies of President Trump and America. \n\nThe governments of Germany and France don't interfere with American national politics. Germany has its election this week and it's considered a safe bet that the conservatives will win the election and the head of the conservative party will become head of the government. In France the conservatives are the dominant power in the ruling coalition and more conservative policies are put into place.\nAll over Europe the governments already become more and more conservative without losing democracy or the personal freedom of the people. \n\nYou really need to rethink your opinion about Russia. Russia is weak, its historically always been the enemy of the US and it really doesn't have anything to offer that our allies aren't already offering to us besides some tips how to suppress your own people. Russia is a weak ally. Their GDP is roughly one fifth of the EUs and their military is about half the size of NATO without the US, even though they already pumped it up for the war in Ukraine. Putin thinks and acts like it would have the power of the former Soviet Union but in reality it's just a mediocre power that strangles it's own economy with corruption and mismanagement and sends it's citizens to die in the hundreds of thousands for a piece of land that just doesn't belong to them, claiming that it's to fight the West and keep US influence away. That's not an ally I want for the US. And they never will be an ally to America. They just pretend to be friendly now to get what they want and regain some of the power the USSR once had. If they get real power again they will do anything to harm the US and the free world, just as they did in the 1900s",
