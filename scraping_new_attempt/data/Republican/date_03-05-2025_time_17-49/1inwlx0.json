IDK where these people live, but clearly not in my stomping grounds.  Most likely just foreign trolls/bots stirring discontent.  Regardless, I wouldn't shed a tear if our liberal extremists left en masse.  I've had more than a lifetime of their crazy in the past decade or two.",

Even if Kamala won and was sitting in the White House, it would never scare me enough to want to leave the country. It\u2019s genuinely a modern marvel how people like this have that mentality. Hopefully you\u2019re right and it\u2019s just a bot account, but tbh I don\u2019t know.",

These are the people who woke up and literally cried over whose butt is in a chair. These are also the people that say they will leave the USA if Trump is elected and then in 4 years, surprise surprise, they\u2019re still here because they love the privileges they have here.",
