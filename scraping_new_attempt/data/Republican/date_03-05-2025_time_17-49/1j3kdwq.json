I have seen different sources conflicting each other on the true nature of birth rates in our country (most likely to push an idea/agenda). Second, so if birth rates are actually lower, no one is actually being \"replaced.\" That is the incorrect term to use. No one is being forced out of the country and replaced with another human being. The media uses the term \"replace\" to make you more afraid of people you are immigrating into the country. It's a scare tactic to create more division. Third, our country has never consistently been the same at every point of its history. Again, our country is a melting pot, and sometimes different ingredients are added to the stew. Fourth, you never answered my questions. What should America be to you, personally, if not a melting pot? Should America just be one culture and one religion?",

On the topic of what religions are acceptable in the minority I say smaller christian denominations, the people that wrote the constitution werent thinking of massive islamic and hindu waves of immigration, the freedom of religion was meant for minority christians, such as myself, I am a catholic. It is an organized replacement, as I said earlier there is a reason the globalists love abortion and birth control so much and push careers over family, it is a deliberate effort to tank the native american birthrate and replace us with cheaper labor. As a side affect of this replacement america as a culture and a people are completely destroyed, despite what we have been taught to believe America is a people too, it isnt just a set of ideas.",

                            "body": "To simplify it, they are, in fact, more moderate than anything. More bluntly, moderate capitalist with either left or right leaning ideology compared to actual moderates who feel both parties are too ideological for simple partisian solutions to work. Liberals still support capitalism (for the most part), amongst other things. They may seek reform but not a revolution of sorts. Meaning, they typically do not want a socialist society. They support greater internationalism while maintaining capitalist ideals. So they usually differ in foreign policy more so than domestic policy from a typical righty, and they may differ more in domestic policy compared to foreign policy from a lefty. It goes deeper, but for the most part, that is what it boils down to. An example could be healthcare. A liberal or rather a right leaning liberal would be more in favor of not having free health care but a more affordable health care by seeking reforms in the health sector without primarily abolishing it. A left leaning liberal may share these sentiments but would want to push for them in a more generous stance. While a socialist or a modern leftist would suggest free health care across the board. Compared to a traditional righty who would want more of the same or more restriction. Another example would be foreign support for Ukraine. A liberal righty would suggest continuing support but maintaining the status quoe or even a more give and take type of support like in the form of loans instead of grants. While a liberal leftist would rather see increased action and support for them in the form of grants and fewer loans. At the same time, a hard-core righty would be more in favor of withdrawal of support and isolationism while maintaining a more traditional stance of give an take. Compared to a hard-core, lefty who would be more inclined to just keep giving without anything or little in return while increasing support. Granted, it is a spectrum for a reason, but this outlines it in a broader sense. There are hard core liberal lefties and hard core liberal righties, just like there are just hard leftists (socialist) and hard righties (traditionalists). It's like how rebublicans are to conservatives and democrats are to socialist. They are similar but different and lean on their respective sides of the spectrum. I'd say most people fall somewhere in between that in America. However, as the divide worsens, so does the radicalism of each ideology and the support behind them. So, in turn, we are actually seeing fewer liberals and more socialist and more conservatives instead of having more Democrats and more Republicans. We went over the left and right scales, but there is also the up and down axis as well. This is where you get fascists, socialism, libertarianism, communism, etc. Depending on the left and right leanings in relation to your up and down leanings. That's a whole nother topic, though.",

Even after men have injured girls in sports. \n\nIt is the demeaning of and belittling anyone and everyone who doesn\u2019t follow the party line. Heck, they all have their own prewritten script to read. All exactly the same. \n\nIt is a mental disorder where they aren\u2019t using their full frontal lobe. All living in the lizard part of our brain, the amygdala.  It is a disease that spreads through the population a rapid speed. It isn\u2019t evolving, it is regressing, devolving.",
