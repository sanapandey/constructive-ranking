I know it\u2019s satire but this is basically what you hear constantly. Trump adds were literally villainizing gay people instead of approaching them with the heart of Christ. \n\nInvalidating leadership with conspiracy theories is not healthy for the future of our nation and is a major flaw in our leadership system right now. It\u2019s known that misinformation is powerful and it kills me how much Republicans and flock to it for political ammo. I used to respect the Republican party till I saw how easily lead around by the nose it is. I was raised Republican, I voted for Trump the first round, but this is just childish. \n\nSure, the left has a ton of problems but nearly everyone I know that\u2019s a Republican doesn\u2019t know a thing about geo politics unless it\u2019s exactly the crap their social media algorithm serves up. As someone that loves history, my Republican friends have literally gotten stupider (especially the ones that use tic tok, don\u2019t know why).",
