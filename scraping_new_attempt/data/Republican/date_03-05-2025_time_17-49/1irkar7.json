This occurs if a part of something is proven to be wrong, it's then assumed that the entire thing is wrong. What I see happening is Elon going into a department with his DOGE team, tweeting about how they found some waste, and then using that as the excuse to essentially take over that department and shut it down. I'm confident there's wasteful spending in all of these departments, but specific examples of wasteful spending doesn't mean the entire department is wasteful or should be shut down",
