He remained loyal and amazing and quite friendly.

He actually wants to reclaim his throne he just is going about it in a somewhat secretive way due to the politics of the past. Likewise book-Aragorn and Arwen are fully committed to their relationship and book Elrond supports Aragorn as Isildur's heir from the start and doesn't need to be convinced by Arwen's light fading. \n\nI do actually like the change in the movie (not that I dislike the original storyline in the book) because it makes it easier to explain the politics / history of the position and characters if they have those little resistances and reluctances. It trims up the storyline in a very palatable way and relies on tropes just enough that we as the audience understand both sides",

I think it\u2019s because to Elrond, if he\u2019s gonna lose his beloved daughter, he wants to make sure that at least she\u2019ll be happy for a little while (relatively speaking) before Aragorn eventually dies, and also he wants it to happen after Middle Earth is saved from Sauron and the kingdom of men is established/secured. It\u2019s a bit of a parallel to how he initially lost his brother, Elros, to establish the first kingdom of men, Numenor.\n\nMy impression is that he\u2019s actually kinda sorta supportive of it all. Like, he\u2019s not happy about it, but more like \u201chey if she\u2019s gonna fade away, then I want her to only do so after marrying the love of her life and having a life with him for a hundred or so years first\u201d. He had Narsil reforged for Aragorn before the fellowship set out from Rivendell, encouraged him to be king, sent his biological sons (he essentially raised/treated Aragorn as his own son too) to aid him etc etc.",

It's just that elven power and magic slowly waning over time, because it's the age of men.\n\nThey aren't dying, or even getting ill, but they are getting weaker, and just generally unhappy. Kinda like homesickness I guess. So they leave to the West, to the continent known as Valinor where the Valar live. The Valar are these divine beings who govern the world on behalf of the creator, sort of like archangels. Elves living in Valinor aren't diminishing the way they are in Middle Earth.\n\nIt's never exactly explaining how or why Elves would be waning in Middle Earth. But it's pretty clearly part of the overall plan for the world that the creator has. It's also something that wasn't always the case. Elves in fact originated in Middle Earth (about 11,000 years before the events in LoTR), and some left for Valinor and then later came back (for complicated reasons) while others never left.",

If your dad's friend was in his death bed, and your dad cried and hugged him, would you think \"huh, my dad is being gay with his buddy\"?

Wouldn't you hold him or her in your arms and cry, and say \"please come back, please don't go away?\". In that point where you suffer because the person you care about will be alone and you can't follow them.\n\nI've been there. Done exactly that.\n\nEverybody would probably do the same at this point. It's not a sexual thing at all. But the portrayal of friendship in media tends to be much less close and developed than the one of romance, thus creating the sensation that any close relationship between two people has to be sexual. That's why we need more movies like LOTR. Very little romance, lots of friendship, lots of love.",

The character trait of showing a rainbow of emotions is not worth praising a character for since EVERY male character these days does it.

Tolkien's work espoused good Christian values *for the time in which he lived.* He also was writing in a somewhat historical context (apparently he drew heavily from the early history of England, especially the conflict between the Normans and the Anglo-Saxons), so he had to create a strong sense of place, and the whole thing started as a bedtime story for his son, so it makes sense that it would skew heavily toward men who are good role models for young men.\n\nAll that to say, I agree with you, his writings are great works of art with much to learn from--both good things to take as examples and bad things to learn to do better--and that it's good to discuss both sides. We as humanity in general should always be striving to move forward and do better and learn from our past in order to improve our future. I hate that society has collectively decided that anyone imperfect needs to be canceled. There are so many figures throughout history who were considered great men and women in their day, but they're not good enough for today's standards, so rather than start a conversation about learning from their mistakes, we ban their books and tear down their statues and erase them from our history. It would be so much more productive to talk about why people thought this was great literature or art or politics or law or military strategy or talking points, and what we in our modern day can learn from the individual's strengths and the prevailing mindset's weaknesses at the time these people rose to prominence.",

The issue is with darker-skinned southern people specifically only allying with the figure/realm embodying evil.\n\nTolkien grew up at the height of the British Empire. Middle-Earth is a Europe and Britain inspired setting. There is a history of Anglo prejudice towards darker skinned people of the South, and particularly during the British Empire most English people would have held strongly racist ideas about dark skinned people in Africa, South Asia, Oceania, etc.\u00a0Tolkien also clearly deals with race in very archaic ways within his own worldbuilding, very intentionally attributing certain qualities and characters to people of each race.\n\nI think it's safe to assume Tolkien knew what he was doing when he mentioned that the dark-skinned people who fought for Mordor are men from the south. He could have chosen them not to be human, or to have another skin color (or not mention skin color at all), or had them come from any direction. It's possible he made these decisions unconsciously, or it's possible he made them with the intention of evoking certain tropes and ideas about race of his time period.\n\nI don't think Tolkien is going to hell for this or anything, and I don't think he was so unserious about his work that he would do this out of purely malicious racism. But I think we can accept that an Englishman born in 1892 might not have represented people of color very well in his work, and that that affects how people today receive his work.",

What I do know is not to completely go in the opposite direction, because in my mind it can only end right here.\n\nWhat I can say, ironically, is that I knew what I was doing was wrong, I simply lacked the conviction to challenge it; I would listen to a Radio programme called Desert Island Discs on Radio 4. Every episode an interviewer sat down with people from all walks of life, but all successful in their own right. The one thing that always connected all of them, was despite initial potential adversity, pursuing their dreams and not being deterred from it in the face of adversity. I think loads are available online (might need a UK VPN).\n\n[I also recommend a bit of philosophy](https://youtu.be/zccoaL0stbM?si=ZcQ87pXF14NbwCyC) (and I'm not a Radio 4 plant, I swear). The videos aren't perfect, but they can serve as some good introductions to people who spent lifetimes trying to quantify what it means to be true to yourself. But I truly think it's something anyone should glance over, if they've ever thought they weren't being true to themselves.\n\nBut of course I get it. If you're going into some office job, we know you can't be in tears during a meeting. Or if it truly is that outside of who you are and where you feel comfortable, is it the right line of work or role for you?\n\nAlso consider meditation. A lot is about quieting the static of your mind, and trying to let emotions wash over you and pass you by. Giving yourself a little more control or tools to know how to let emotions happen to you with ultimately, a little more control, can be great for you.\n\nIf you ever want to shoot me a message, I'm open. :)",

This - at least, as far as the police are concerned - is most likely a regular serial killing. As in, someone who murders because they want to murder, not because they want to enact political change or make other people feel afraid.",

I obv don\u2019t know what exactly happened in the example you alluded to but generally I think it is absolutely fine to cry as long as nobody is reliant on you. \n\nMaybe to borrow a lotr example theoden (rohirrim king) cried at the grave of his son and I don\u2019t think it is seen as a negative or a weakness because there the burial and everything connected to it is done so he can just grieve at this point.

So seeing someone who cries at small things, there's a part of me.that wonders why they lose control so easily.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Now, I know that's not how it works. I know you're dealing with things your way, but the thought is always there. The perception here is that you aren't in control of your emotions and tend towards being irrational.\u00a0\n\n\nThat may not be the case, but in my experience people who cry easily tend to make choices based more on what will let them stop crying rather than what is objectively better for all involved.\n\n\nMy advice to you is to focus on being objective and make sure you're not acting on the emotions you're experiencing. If you can do that, the tears aren't a problem.\u00a0",

Lying to his wife and \"son\" was to protect them from the actual evil (Robert Baratheon), its harder to keep a secret than to share it, especially if that secret is such a dishonorable thing, which kinda shows he didn't care about being seen as honorable, but was just about that life. At the end when he confesses to be a traitor and throws away entire image of an honorable man for the life of his daughters.\n\nKilling her pet was also because of the power that evil(Robert Baratheon and Cersei) held, and he had no choice and even took that burden upon himself to always carry the responsibility of his decisions(he who passes the sentence should swing the sword). They even got the Butcher's boy killed. \n\nAlso when his other daughter didn't want to be a lady of some castle he hired the best swordsman of bravos to train her, instead of forcing his will on her. Which would be unheard of.\n\nMaybe you're right when it comes to excluding his wife from decision-making. And in the end she takes a lot of questionable decisions on her own without Ned as well, like taking Tyrion prisoner. Didn't seem like a particularly healthy relationship.\n\nOne thing I hated about him was how he was friends with Robert because he was truly a piece of shit.\n\nHis society was completely dogshit, but he was truly exceptional in his society.",

Not that it was not masculine, but that his idea of masculinity was too \u201cold\u201d, it was something even older than what we today call \u201ctraditional masculinity\u201d. The traditional masculine archetype of the 1950\u2019s was the roudy laborer, the factory worker, the blue collar family man, and the soldier of WWII and Korea. Tolkien by then was clinging to a past masculinity.\n\nThe masculinity of Tolkien is even older, stemming from romanticism of the enlightenment gentleman, the dandy, people like Oscar Wilde, Charles Dickens, or Lord Byron. Not the roudy factory worker or the rough blue collar laborer, but the refined dandy, the ellegant gentleman, the educated man who shares poems in latin with his friends ina fancy dinner table. \n\nThis was already long dead by the time LOTR came out. The \u201ctraditional masculinity\u201d of the 20th century had also made a mockery of the dandy, of the refined gentleman. And icons like Lord Byron were even portrayed as gay, not as celebration but as insult. The dandy was to be a failure, to be mocked, ridiculed, to be shown as a gay or queer individual to be insulted and put down from the stick up studios and fancy lecture halls. So when audiences read LOTR\u2019s men, it was weird that the romantic gentlemen were the heroes, not the gay punching bags or comedic relief. \n\nSo when people say Aragorn is \u201ctraditionally masculine\u201d, he is not. He\u2019s more of \u201carchaic masculine\u201d, something even older than the traditional masculinity we know today.",

The image shows four virtues: respect women, unhesitatingly offer support to those in need, don\u2019t be cruel, show humility.\u00a0\n\n\nAll four of those virtues can be enacted whether a man has \u201cpower\u201d or not.\u00a0\n\n\nIn a more general sense, you do not require power or prestige to be a good man. What you do need is empathy, kindness, and a backbone to stick up for what is right. None of that requires success or power.\u00a0\n\n\nIndeed, I think this idea that men *should* \u201cacquire power,\u201d is quite misguided. It\u2019s an option, sure, and many men feel a strong compulsion towards it. Be it financial success, being an employer or leader. However, there are many other equally valid options for men.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe idea that \u201cpower\u201d is an integral part of manhood is an old idea borne of repressive gender expectations. It doesn\u2019t reflect actual philosophy on how to live a good life and be a good person. Not does it encapsulate everything positive about masculinity, not by a long shot.\u00a0",

But this like\u2026normal \ud83d\ude05\n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of people y\u2019all spending time with but most of the men in my life are like this. And those who aren\u2019t, that\u2019s okay too. We all have our own ways to cope with things. We don\u2019t have to be a certain way or fit a certain type. People meant for us will accept us as we are. They won\u2019t try to fit us into \u2018Aragorn\u2019 mold or their version of healthy masculinity.\n\nAnother part of this is Eowyn and Arwen. Arwen especially sacrificed a lot for love. She decided not to sail with people, gave up her eternal life, all because she had faith in her man that too when times were bleak. Galadriel herself stated it was a lost cause and if we win, it\u2019d be a miracle. Neither did Eowyn or Arwen lose interest in him when he showed emotions. They were steady enough to take charge when their men couldn\u2019t. Arwen would lay down her life in a battle and so did Eowyn. She slayed someone whom even Gandalf thought was a formidable enemy.\n\nBefore yelling healthy masculinity and living in some fantasy world, understand real world works differently \ud83d\ude04 And if you want to yell healthy masculinity, learn about healthy femininity as well.\n\nEowyn didn\u2019t use Faramir as a rebound to fuck around because Aragorn didn\u2019t give her a chance. Neither did she think any less of Aragorn when he bowed before the hobbits. They rightfully deserved it. If you say men like Aragorn are rare, I\u2019d say women like Arwen are rare too. She was a healer! When Aragorn was faced with a tough choice, she made sure she stayed with him to see it through rather than saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem! Go see a therapist for it\u201d or whatever. Of course, Aragorn had to fight his own demons and battles, but at the very least, Arwen didn\u2019t make him feel like he had to do it all alone.\n\nMost women yelling healthy masculinity in the comments section wouldn\u2019t give two shits about an honourable lad like Aragorn. It\u2019s a plus that he is attractive. There\u2019s plenty of guys around who aren\u2019t straight up 10s but are honourable and would treat a woman with dignity and respect. No one has given two fucks about them.",
