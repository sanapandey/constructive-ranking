It took me about a year and some change to complete the Latin course, and then I started Greek because the daily refreshers were garbage.  I subsequently purchased a book to keep learning Latin from and was surprised at how little I had actually learned in DuoLingo. \n\n\nAll the lessons are short and don't explain grammar, so you have to be a bit familiar with how language is structured going into it to parse the conjugations and stuff. \n\n\nMy overall opinion after a couple years of use is that DuoLingo is literally the bare minimum you can do to learn a language. But it's free and it's better than nothing.  But my opinion is possibly skewed by the fact that I went after the classics instead of something that may be more productive.",

You can know every one of those things except one and you still are beginner level at the language. So I can learn how to deal with grammatical structures, conjugations, tenses, and exceptions, but if I don't know the definition of 95% of the words used in a passage, then I'm screwed. That part is pure memorization too. Some of the others at least work systematically. Boy I wish this was just math where you could get to the same result no matter what path you take as long as you don't break any rules",

I'm good at memorizing stuff and applying logic but only to some (related)degree. I can understand a concept, use it, play around. But when it comes to math logic I'm screwed. I just don't get it, *can't get it* the way it works so I'm stuck with basics. I also bad at the grammatical structure of languages, the rules and all that, but I noticed I can easily do the communicating part. I understand people, they understand me, some things just naturally stuck with me without effort. It's the \"polishing\" part I suck at.\n\nFor example, this whole paragraph. I'm not a native English speaker and it shows \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

The other wild thing is the people who come in on Sunday night only to do a few lessons to get to rank 1 right away and then do nothing for the rest of the week. It never fails.
