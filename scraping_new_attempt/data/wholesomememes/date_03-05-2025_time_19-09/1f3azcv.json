Additionally, the white lines between the baby and the parents are the blankets of the bed rolled up acting like a shield for the baby in case they do roll inwards by rolling on their own face.\n\nNow, I might agree that the blankets being the white lines might have been unclear, but the simple fact that they were sleeping on the edges of the bed is showing enough information that they care for the safety of the baby and they don't want to crush him.",
