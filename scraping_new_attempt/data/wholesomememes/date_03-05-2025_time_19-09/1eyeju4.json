Online I already had a community) came because I went into my local game store, bought some magic the gathering card because I wanted to learn how to play and I showed up on Thursday. I learned with people who liked to play. It's even easier today since they sell premade deck that you can then customize.\n \nTake something you want to learn and odds are there are people who will teach it to you. \n \nYeah it takes work and I had to shuffle my schedule a bit around my activities but every boss will accommodate you. If they don't, change job ASAP. I got hired eventually into that game store",
