It\u2019s like we\u2019re all stuck in this cosmic game of emotional hot potato, and instead of just passing it on, some of us are actively working on breaking the cycle. I mean, props to those of us trying to untangle the mess while also rolling our eyes at the same time. It\u2019s exhausting but also kind of empowering to recognize it and say, 'Not today, trauma!' Let\u2019s just hope the next generation can smirk about it too, but with way fewer emotional landmines.",

That child, who will one day be your grandfather, then beats his child. That child, who will one day be your father, grows up and beats his child (you). Each generation is perpetuating abuse and causing the next to have emotional issues. \n\nGenerational trauma can come in many forms. It doesn\u2019t have to be just physical abuse. It\u2019s a complex issue and requires a lot of self awareness and determination to see the cycle and take steps to stop it.",
