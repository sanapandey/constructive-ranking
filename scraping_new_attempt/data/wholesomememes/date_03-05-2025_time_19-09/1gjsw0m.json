            "body": "Hey friends! I know a lot of you might be holding on to some anxiety and could use something to take your mind off things. Take a moment to leave a separate comment about a hobby you like, or want to learn more about, or maybe mention a game you want to play but would like someone to play with. Putting yourself out there can be difficult, but the internet usually makes it a bit easier. I hope everyone makes a new friend today!\n\n(\u261e\uff9f\u2200\uff9f)\u261e (\u25cd\uff1e\u25e1\uff1c\u25cd)\u22c8\u3002\u2727\u2661 \u2570(\u273f\u00b4\u2323`\u273f)\u256f\u2661\n\nAlso, we have been pretty strict about enforcing our new original content requirement as well as our long standing definition of wholesome being \u201cuplifting and/or motivating\u201d - so there have not been very many posts we can approve. We have updated some of our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/about/) and our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/s/zCP5V6KIip), but have more guidance, tools, and even some events on the horizon. We would love for you to share your OC memes / comics! Just keep in mind that it should be a meme (image/gif with text on or in it), it should be general (not specific to just you) so more people can relate to it, and not JUST a cute animal - if your meme features something cute, it must still be uplifting and/or motivating. \n\n``\u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294   =^..^=   U\u1d25U   \u208d\u1422\u2022\ufecc\u2022\u1422\u208e   \u01b8\u0335\u0321\u04dc\u0335\u0328\u0304\u01b7   \u0e05^\u2022\ufecc\u2022^\u0e05``\n\nIt can sometimes take us up to 24 hours to review and approve posts, so we really appreciate your patience. And if for some reason your meme doesn\u2019t get approved, just know we are trying to be fair to everyone and we encourage you to keep trying :) \n\n(\uff89\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5)\uff89*\u2661\uff9f \u2727\uff9f\uff65:\u2727\u2764\u30fd(\u25d5\u30ee\u25d5\u30fd)\n\nBe well and be kind \ud83e\udef6",

It's perfect for anyone of any age or experience to get them into programming and/or game dev in general.",
