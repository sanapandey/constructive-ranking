Compliments are absolutely earned, not just given. Women tend to get more compliments from men because they put more effort in - style their hair nicely in a way that suits them, wear outfits rather than random clothes, learn what style and application of makeup best complements their features, etc. \n\nLike I said, if you do these things already and still don't get compliments, this comment doesn't really apply to you, and I hope you'll get some soon, but if you don't do them but do want compliments, it starts with you. Style your hair in a more flattering way if you don't, start putting together what you wear as an outfit rather than putting on whatever. Put in some effort into how you look and you'll get more positive attention about it!",
