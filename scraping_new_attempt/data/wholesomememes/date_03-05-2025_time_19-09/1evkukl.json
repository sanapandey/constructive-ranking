That\u2019s when I noticed her eyes weren\u2019t her father\u2019s color at all. They were my father\u2019s. They were chocolate but swirls of maroon red. I started tearring up. She looked at me and said, what? Are you ok? I cleared my throat and said, yes. Yea I\u2019m fine. I just realized you have grandpas eye color. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever look in his eyes again. And her being a teen said, ok weirdo. Rolled my dad\u2019s eyes, crossed her arms and smiled. That\u2019s the day I knew my dad was still with me.",
