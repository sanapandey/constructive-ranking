My original project idea was never going to work, and one of my committee members absolutely should have had the breadth of knowledge to tell me it wasn't going to work, but he didn't. My advisor wanted me to get a small proof of concept project done before submitting the prospectus, so I wasted more time than I want to think about trying to get it working. The department hired someone in 2021 whose entire scope of work was exactly what I was trying to do and he immediately told me \"this is going to be INCREDIBLY difficult and has a very low chance of producing results. I will help you try, but you need to be prepared that this is probably not going to work. Why did [first guy] sign off on this?\" Lo and behold it did not work.",
