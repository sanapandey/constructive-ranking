We loved your submission, Let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t get the middle seat. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c, but it has been removed because it doesn't quite abide by our rules, which are located in the sidebar.\n\n* (**Rule #1**) All posts must be wholesome memes.\nWe're not saying this is unwholesome! Just that sub's focus is uplifting, unless nicing-up existing rude memes. There are already great subs for cute (/r/aww, /r/eyebleach, /r/rarepuppers), things that make us smile (/r/MadeMeSmile, /r/HumansBeingBros, /r/AnimalsBeingBros), or that give us the feels (/r/WholesomeFeels or /r/baww). This might also fit better in another sub in the [Wholesome Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/awkwardtheturtle/m/wholesome/). It's not a \"no\" - it's a \"not the best fit here,\" and another sub will be better.\n\n   * We appreciate you thinking of us very much! For more on our rules, please check out our sidebar. If you have any questions or concerns about this removal, feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fwholesomememes).",
