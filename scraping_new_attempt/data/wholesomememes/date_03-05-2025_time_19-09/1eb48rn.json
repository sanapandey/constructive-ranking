Pretending that you are depressed or have any other form of mental health illness when you don't just to seek attention from others is itself a mental health issue and should be treated as such rather than part of someones personality. It can stem from childhood and a lack of attention or care in early years, making some people seek attention to extreme points, being so desperately attention-defecit it can even be hard for them to probably recognise when they are given proper attention and always want more.\n\nAlthough on the other hand other people, strangers, might not be properly equipped to handle your issues so it's best for not just your own health but also theirs to seek medical help or at least help from close friends if you suspect you might be suffering from anything like this. Don't treat it as a bad thing, it's simply a mental health problem you may be dealing with and there's ways for you to get better with the proper care. You don't need to be categorised as a sociopath just because you want attention and go to unhealthy lengths to have it.\n\nI suppose if someone is continually refusing help and continuing in their bad health habits you're free to choose if you care to associate with them as I'm sure it can definitely affect those close to them as well. I admire and respect people who stand by someone like that even through the mental health burden or toll it may take on you. Just hopefully it's something most people are aware of before jumping the gun and selflessly supporting someone with mental health issues by themselves like that.",
