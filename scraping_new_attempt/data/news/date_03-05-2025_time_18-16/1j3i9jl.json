Those that stayed silent therefore do not matter. \n\nOk, you confirmed that you are, indeed, confused. Let me try to clarify. \n\nYou are actually missing a group that voted for neither, and still voted. \n\nYou're talking about voting groups, which is irrelevant at this moment, and will be irrelevant for the next 22 months. Those are important numbers every 24 months, or every 48 if you're only counting the general election. \n\nI'm talking about your original inflammatory statement: \n\n> _\"...most Americans don\u2019t have the comprehension to understand how this is a problem and what it leads to.\"_\n\nIf you meant to say _\"most voting Americans...\"_, then correct your original post and make that edit. If not, your numbers and your assumptions, are wildly off-base. \n\nYou're also making the grossly incorrect, and specious leap that 90 million Americans who didn't vote for Harris or Trump in the 2024 election, suddenly don't care that their country is swerving at high speed down Fascist Highway, and that they would simply sit down and watch it happen. \n\nThey do care, and they represent another 27'ish% of the total population of the United States. Simply saying \"therefore do not matter\", just shows a level of ignorance that belies your intended argument here. \n\nThese 90 million Americans have opinions, and motivations and families and friends and coworkers that they care about, and care about them (to varying degrees, of course). \n\nMany of them are also armed, a significant majority in fact, and more than willing to step up and step out of their homes to defend themselves, their families, their neighbors and this country, if it comes to that. \n\nSo if there was a civil disagreement that rose to conflict, you would have 77 million Americans on one side of the table who _might_ decide to run their mouth or become violent, and you have 157 million on the other side who might have something different to say to them. \n\nNobody cares what party you represent, left/right, blue/red, Democrat/Republican, when it comes to fighting off fascism and the oligarchic takeover of our democratically governed Constitutional republic in this country. \n\nNobody is going to ask who you voted for before they throw the first words, the first punch, the first shot. That's not how it works, and we have hundreds of prior art examples going back through history where this exact situation has been the case in other countries, other civilizations. \n\nSo let's walk back the false rhetoric and start talking about solutions here, not slinging about unrelated \"voter statistics\". \n\nLet's heal this nation, not promote and foment more hate that further divides us.",

He was clearly not malicious, and whatever your thoughts on his policy stances or communication style, he was always informed and adept in his long political career. I tend to side with people who say he was capable of running the country at that point but not necessarily the performance that running a campaign requires, and who knows what the next 4 years would have looked like for the guy if he won. I like Joe Biden, and think his presidency is highly underrated. But even for me that debate was a real eye opener",

The rest of the news outlets threatened to boycot the pool if Obama banned them. Obama relented and let them back in.\n\nThat whole episode was really overblown (and Obama wasn't involved). There was a pen and pad Q & A w/ a Treasury official (Ken Feinberg) on executive compensation that Fox didn't even bother to attend. Four other networks sent reporters, and following the session, they found it newsworthy enough that they asked Feinberg to redo it as a series of round-robin evening news interviews. Feinberg agreed and the WH put out a request for a Pool reporter to record the interviews. That particular Pool reporter, seeing the same four listed Networks, raised an objection to the network Bureau Chiefs that Fox should be included too, they agreed, the WH added Fox and Fox took their turn during the round-robin recorded interviews. Fox was heading the White House Correspondents Association at the time and the rest of the press were constantly trying to curry favor with them. \n\nAfter, Fox made the whole incident into some sort of deliberate plot by the Whitehouse to intentionally exclude them, and added it one of their litany of constantly raised eternal outrages. Obama adviser Anita Dunn responded to Fox's complaints by saying White Houses' had always had selective control over what interviews their officials choose to accept, but that in this particular case the only reason Fox's name hadn't been on the initial pool request was that they hadn't participated in the Feinberg pen and pad that precipitated it.",

In other words, should the ban be temporarily paused until the court makes a decision?\n\nFor the first question, judge in this case has said that \"case law in this circuit is uniformly unhelpful to the White House,\" suggesting that he may be willing to force the White House to restore the AP's access.  However, it's going to be a while until issues his ruling.\n\nThe second question, on the other hand, just deals with a short-term solution, and it requires a completely separate argument from the AP.  Specifically, the AP can only get the injunction if it can demonstrate that it will suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the ban continues while the legal proceedings take place.  This may be hard to show, regardless of whether it can be proven that the White House is breaking the rules.",

A few years later they had to settle for $800 million after helping Trump lie about his election hoax for months, leading up to January 6th. Obama was entirely correct here - Fox News was and is destructive to the US and you're watching that today just like people watched it 15 years ago.\n\nBy contrast, Trump declared *all* non-Fox outlets 'fake news' and 'enemy of the people' and then also banned AP, which is the gold standard of unbiased news. \n\nWhat Obama did was similar to stop inviting the heckler to his shows. What Trump did was similar to saying \"2+2 = 5\" and then banning the calculator because it produced 4.",

Sullivan (1963) \u2013 The Court ruled that informal government pressure (e.g., a state commission \"advising\" booksellers not to sell certain books) could violate the First Amendment, even though no law was passed.\n\nNational Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie (1977) \u2013 The Court ruled that denying a permit for a Nazi march violated the First Amendment, even though it was an administrative decision rather than a law.\n\nTrump v. Hawaii (2018) (Dissenting Opinions) \u2013 While the Court upheld the travel ban, dissenting justices argued that executive orders should be subject to First Amendment scrutiny when they target religious groups.\n\n2. Law Enforcement Actions & Retaliation\n\nNiemotko v. Maryland (1951) \u2013 The Court struck down a city's decision to deny a permit for a religious group to hold a meeting in a public park, even though\n\nEdit: No response to that, huh?",

I don't think it's relevant here because Trump isn't trying to limit the AP from publishing or distributing their works, that would be anti free speech. Access to the oval office isn't a right to free speech or press issue, .\n\nNational Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie: This is more about if the swastika was \"free speech\" or \"fighting words\", since fighting words are not covered under free speech. They initially disallowed them marching with swastikas as they ruled it was fighting words, but that was overturned. The denial was legitimate as it was initially ruled their symbol was fighting words and the courts have ruled fighting words aren't covered under free speech.\n\nTrump v. Hawaii: if the ban was based on religion alone this would have been a different story, but they determined there were legitimate grounds for the ban outside of unconstitutional ones like religion.\n\nNiemotko v. Maryland: denial to a location based on a protected class, like religion, is unconstitutional, and this case backs that up. Denial based on how you name a body of water isn't protected.\n\nBack to the original point, do these cases show that even without Congress making laws that something can be unconstitutional? Yes I think some of them do. Does any of this show that Trump isn't allowed to kick people out because he doesn't like the way they report? I don't think so. \n\nOne big difference is that all of the examples are about groups or entities denying access, but what about an individual, like Trump? Does an individual have the right to kick someone out of their home for saying something they don't like? Absolutely. I think that's more like what Trump is doing here, it's basically his house and he decides why gets invited. This isn't a public park or something, it's the private residence of the president.",
