In these systems, tax authorities use data from employers, financial institutions, and other relevant sources to pre-populate tax returns, which taxpayers can then review, adjust if necessary, and submit. Notable examples include:\n\n* **Denmark**: Offers pre-filled tax returns, with a high participation rate among taxpayers.\n* **Sweden**: Provides pre-filled tax forms, simplifying the filing process for its citizens.\n* **Finland**: Delivers pre-filled income tax returns to all taxpayers for their review.\n* **Norway**: Implements a system where the majority of taxpayers receive fully prepared returns.\n* **Estonia**: Known for its efficient tax system, it takes the average person approximately five minutes to file taxes, thanks to pre-filled returns.\n* **Germany**: Provides a pre-filled tax return service where certain data from third parties, such as health insurance companies and employers, is automatically entered into a citizen's tax return upon authorization.\n\nAdditionally, countries like Spain and France have systems in place to notify taxpayers electronically that their pre-populated forms are ready for review and submission.\n\nOverall, many European countries have adopted pre-filled tax return systems to streamline the tax filing process and reduce administrative burdens on taxpayers.\"",

For more info see: https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306\n\nThe regular working person with W2 reported income can't avoid paying for long. IRS knows how much they earned and will aggressively seek payment, including wage garnishment if one ignores the issue long enough.\n\nAnother aspect is many lower income people get more money back than they had withheld. Effectively paying a negative tax rate. EITC is a prime example. In those instances, claiming exempt won't make much difference other than getting a smaller refund.",

Plans include a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivised buyouts as part of a wider effort to shrink the government under the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, around 7,000 probationary IRS employees have already been dismissed, with further reductions expected. The proposed cuts, if approved, could see tens of thousands more staff departing, a move that former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has warned would leave the agency \"dysfunctional.\"\n\nIn a controversial twist, some IRS employees could be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security to assist with immigration enforcement. A letter from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested IRS workers to help with the administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n\nFederal agencies have been ordered to submit their workforce reduction plans by 13 March, though it remains unclear whether the White House will approve the IRS restructuring or how quickly it would take effect. While the administration argues that streamlining the government will increase efficiency, critics, including a group of seven former IRS commissioners, have warned that gutting the agency will only weaken its ability to collect taxes and fund government services.\n\nDespite repeated requests, the White House, Treasury Department and IRS have yet to comment on the plans. As the tax season continues, IRS employees involved in processing returns have been told they cannot accept buyout offers until after the filing deadline in mid-May. The outcome of this dramatic reorganisation could have far-reaching consequences for tax collection, public services and the broader functioning of government.",
