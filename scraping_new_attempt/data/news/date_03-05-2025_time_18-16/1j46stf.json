Silencers are good for basically every single firearm regardless of type or purpose (though in some cases like shotguns they're not very effective so they aren't commonly used). They're not some super-assassin specialist toy that makes guns completely silent, that's pretty much hollywood myth. They're just something that brings guns down from causing instant permanent hearing damage to just being extremely loud. They're basically just like a muffler on your car, really. If something goes bump in the night and you grab your gun to defend your family, a suppressor means you won't cause your kids permanent hearing damage if you end up having to shoot an attacker, because it's not like you can time out to pause the home invasion to put proper hearing protection on every member of your family and then tap back in once everyone's ears are covered. It's a legitimate safety accessory that is valid on every firearm, and notably in a lot of European countries where guns are extremely heavily regulated there are often no restrictions at all on suppressors because of this.",

They lower a firearm from the range of hearing damage to less hearing damage.  It'll drop it 20-30 decibels, but is commonly still over 100. With noises that loud, its still recommended you wear hearing protection for prolonged exposure.\n\nThat reduction does make it better for neighbors and safer for the person shooting.\n\nYou don't buy one if you want to kill someone, as they are fairly difficult to get and make a handgun much more unwieldy and hard to conceal.",
