On top of that, starting in the 2nd semester put me behind in internship opportunties because most companies coming to my school are usually looking in the fall for the summer, and I was behind 1 class; essentially meaning I was only a Junior for 1 semester credit wise.\n\nThat's not including financial hurdles such as maintaining a car made 22 years ago and paying rent over the summer while living with my family (scholarships covered school housing).

Yes, some stayed home for some of the reasons I mentioned.\n\n>Always the voters, never the democratic party\n\nDemocratic voters chose Biden and Harris.  But yes, even Bernie and AOC pleading for people to turn out wasn't enough.  People just didn't care, or they opted out \"out of principle\" or to \"teach the Dems a lesson.\"  \n\n>Remember I'm \"speaking\"\n\nWell, *was* she speaking?   Yes, there are hecklers and protesters out there.  They wanted to derail the whole thing to make it about their one issue.   But there was a lot more at stake than just that.  And those who stayed home over Gaza, got Trump.  \n\n>that never wanted Joe Biden to never drop out \n\nNo, I was fine with Harris.  I voted for her, and didn't need to \"hold my nose\" or suppress a gag reflex to do so   She was far closer to my values and priorities than, well, Trump.  And we were going to get one of those.\n\n>Tell me why the dems starting blaming how they were too pro Trans after they lost? \n\nI'm not sure there's a consensus that this one issue is *the* issue.  I don't think there's one issue.  I think the preponderance of the population is just either fairly conservative, or they don't really care enough to turn out.   Sure, the conservatives weaponized the issue of trans support among Dems, but it's not like Harris had trans people at the center of her campaign.   Dems support trans rights, true, but they also support abortion access.   \n\n>Tell me why they had Liz Cheney?\n\nIn an effort to reach  out to anti-Trump conservatives, and those conservatives who (they hoped) still believed in decency and the rule of law.   I didn't think it would work, because I think conservatives almost always come home in the end.  \n\n>Tell me why they went more to the right in their campaign?\n\nOn what issue specifically?   They tried to appeal to moderate Dem voters, yes, because those are both greater in number and more reliable in turnout than progressives.  But Harris was of course successfully painted as a radical by the right and as *maaaaaybe* 10% less fascist than Trump by terminally online progressives.  I honestly think the largest issue that undercut turnout was her being a black woman.  But in a population where people self-identify as not even seeing color (and that applies among progressives as well), that's anathema to talk about.   There was just *something about her*.  So, of course, we get Trump.  \n\n>Kamala ran a shit campaign\n\nShe had about 100 days.  And we knew that if she didn't win, Trump would.   This is after Dobbs, after 6 Jan, with Project 2025 out in the open.   Those who cared about those things, turned out.   \n\n>Do you even have a ideology or do you just like what ever position the democratic party is on? \n\nI do have values, and the Dems are closer to my values than the Republicans.   So, as with every election, I had to choose between the candidates/parties running.  I chose the one closer to my values. \n\n> Are votes earned or demanded? \n\nI vote because I consider it a civic duty, and I knew Trump winning would hurt people and lead to chaos.   I used the political voice I have to try to prevent that from happening. If you didn't care enough about what was at stake, that's your prerogative.  Even if you want to frame it as someone else not \"earning\" your vote.   Which just means \"they didn't make me care enough to try to prevent Trump from winning, and all of this from happening.  Stupid Dems!\"",
