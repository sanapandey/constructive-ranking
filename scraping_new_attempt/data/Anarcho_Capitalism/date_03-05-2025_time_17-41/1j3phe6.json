It basically implies either the goverment or an allied goverment was running pedophile honeypots at pedo island.... She could've done the \"we can't confirm or deny\" answer they usually do, which says nothing or a blanket denial of knowledge. It'd be like if the goverment said they can't disclose on Aliens because it'd threaten national security. That says _a lot_ more than \"it isn't real\" or \"we can't confirm or deny anything\" doesn't it?",

            "body": "Alright, long post incoming.\n\n\nNumerous rich and powerful people transcending political boundaries who are using their wealth and influence to prevent this information getting out. And honestly, it's probably nobody you know by name (that's the whole point). As of 2024 there are 756 billionaires in the USA; you can probably name 4 of them, but let's be honest, it's fair to say that it is likely that a significant number of those 756 billionaires at least knew this was happening for sure and did nothing, had a reasonable suspicion it was happening and stayed quiet, were actively involved in some way such as facilitating the smuggling of kids for the group, or actively and directly participating.\nThe rich and powerful of other nations are very likely implicated as well, such as many Middle-Eastern nations, African nations, South American nations, Australia/Canada/New Zealand/the UK/the EU, and likely many others. After all, many of Epsteins victims were trafficked from around the globe, those kids had to come from somewhere. This would implicate... so many powerful people in so many nations.\nOn a specific note, the UK Royal Family are heavily implicated in the affair as well, through a certain prince whose public handling of the matter has been... less than stellar. A leak from America heavily implicating the Royals with child-rape of this scale would be hugely damaging to UK-USA relationships and, by extension, relationships between the USA and other Commonwealth countries, such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada, India, etcetera\nHollywood as an institution is... let's face it, they are involved in this too. Probably actors you know, definitely producers and finances you don't. Hollywood has its own power too, and they don't want this information getting out either. Think about how long it took for Harvey Weinstein to fall out of grace, and his actions were basically an open secret for a long, long, long time. He was much more brazen and public than Epstein ever was, and so many people knew about him, almost all of whom stayed quiet about it and clapped and smiled when he was thanked at the Oscars. With some notable exceptions.\nGiven the ties between various political leaders, wealthy and powerful billionaires, wealthy and powerful influencers, foreign intelligence agencies, and the USA, it is highly unlikely that organisations like the FBI, CIA, etc were not at least aware of this operation and benefitting from it, if not active participants in some way. A leak from America heavily implicating it's own intelligence apparatus with child assault  of this scale would be hugely damaging to America\nThere are, almost certainly, important people on both sides of the political isle who are impacted by this, meaning that there's a kind of \"mutually assured destruction\" situation occurring here; if the full files are released, the effect on both major political parties would be devastating, and accordingly, neither has an incentive to do this as it would be the equivalent of a political suicide bombing.\nLong story short\nNo foreign entity with access to this information has anything to gain.\nNo American political party stands to benefit.\nThe rich and powerful of both the EU and US lose everything\n\n\n\nIn short, nobody but the common man benefits, which is why we'll never get a complete list.\n\nSorry for the lack of formatting but I directly copied this from discord and i'm too lazy to correct it.",
