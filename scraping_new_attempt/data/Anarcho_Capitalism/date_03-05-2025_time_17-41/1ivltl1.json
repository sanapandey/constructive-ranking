    "selftext": "I seen this question asked earlier, but gaging from the answers I seen, it would appear some of you are behind the curve a bit. I say that with respect, of all \"political structures\" anarcho-capitalism tugs at my heart strings the most because the theory of it prevents BOTH government and communal ownership from becoming a source of tyrannical oppression. \n\nSo to put my question in perspective, I'd like to clarify that formalized governance is no more or less subject to becoming tyrannical than non formalized governance.\n\nThis is the same \"catch 22\" that not even top communist theorist can figure out, there's no way to firmly keep any given society from bouncing back and forth from a stateless society and a state ran society.\n\nThe culprit in both anarcho-capitalist/communist societies is that both are dependent on democracy. Democracy is absolutely necessary to maintain the balance of power in favor of the people, but any unified standards, such as \"rule of law\", requires at the very least a non formalized system of governance to uphold. With absolutely no unified standards, then pure democracy becomes a source of oppression known as \"the tyranny of the majority\", or \"the tyranny of the misinformed\". \n\nSince it's absolutely impossible to represent the interests of all people in equal measure in a pure democracy, society will naturally polarize and the ensuing chaos most often necessitates a heavy handed top down authoritarianism. In fact, historically speaking, it's pretty much guaranteed lol. \n\nSo what's the game plan to keep pure democracy from destabilizing society without either formalized or non formalized governance becoming a tyrannical force, even if it were only an unintended consequence?",

We will prevent them from returning.

That doesn't make any sense.  Could we lose that will?  Of course.  Welcome to humanity.  Political philosophy isn't magic and there is no neat or pretty solution outside the one where humans no longer exist (I'm super duper not in favour of that option by the way).  We will ALWAYS struggle against the downsides of human nature.  But we build pretty cool civilizations from time to time.  Why not this one?  Why not now?",

Not only that but we have so much food that we throw away billions of tons of it annually because we make way too much food. We also have nearly any kind of food you could imagine, it's cheap, obtainable nearly anywhere (you can get it delivered directly to your door), and it's fast (same-day delivery).\n\nAnd how do we have so much food?

If the government handled food for everyone much like they do education and you were to talk about ending the government, someone would likely say to you, \"but without the government, how would people get food?\"\n\nSo you can see how that question is nonsense. The government doesn't do food and we have so much food it's silly. In fact, if the government DID do food we would likely have much higher food prices, less options for food, and possibly even food shortages. If we didn't have food shortages, food would probably cost a LOT more, like double or triple the current costs.\n\nThere is nothing that the government does that we couldn't get - and get better - without it. Nothing. Not even security. Even having companies provide military would be superior to a single standing military.",

Assuming natural rights are inherent, and \"human rights\" are technically granted even though it has a catchy name to it lol.",

Natural rights are matters of self-defense, i.e. it is justifiable to defend oneself from violations of natural rights. There is no one who believes that *they themselves* should be murdered (life), enslaved (liberty), or stolen from (property), so these rights are universal as far as anyone can tell. There is no rising from the ashes regarding natural rights, they can only be suppressed by violence which is universally seen as wrong.\n\nlol.",

There's also an undertone of \"safety\" and \"sustainability\" encoded into the framework that ultimately doesn't benefit the welfare of the general population at the same rate in which it enables tyrannical oppression. As a collective approach, \"freedom\" isn't much more than a matter of public opinion. \n\nNatural Rights are \"rights\" based on the philosophy of natural law (SUPERIOR TO MARXIST THEORY...). You are correct, self defense is the first law of nature, property rights are the foundation of freedom (its not about material possessions, but the right itself...) and liberty is in accordance with our natural state of existence are all natural rights, and the oppositions to such are UNNATURAL institutions worthy of destroying. \n\nSo to say \"natural rights wouldn't raise up\" would be the same as to say unnatural institutions will prevail. Individual autonomy can't be subjagated into peaceful slavery forever... it's our very nature to defy such institutions. If you truly understood Hegel's work, you'd know that.",

So the only thing that needs to happen to keep illegitimate organizations at bey is to get people to understand natural rights, and if there is such a thing as a social contract it should be restricted to acknowledging that these rights apply to everyone, or at least the presumption of those rights should be the standard, just as in the presumption of innocence\\[1\\].\n\n\\[1\\] violation of the natural rights of another would invalidate the rights of the violator, since they are rejecting the notion of natural rights by their actions, including for themselves, which in turn is implicit consent to ignore their rights and use force on them.\n\nIn short it's a matter of changing the philosophy/culture of the public and maintaining it. Will that ever happen? I don't know.",

I hate to admit that, but that's exactly what it is. \n\nThe truth is, none of us know for sure, but there are ways to somewhat force a reaction at the very least. \n\nAll I know is our government was founded on the constitutional principles in accordance with the founding era. And natural law was the philosophy used. The better we understand that, the better chance we stand. So at all points, NATURAL LAW BECOMES A FORCE OF LIBERATION. Not the government...\n\nBut fucking unfortunately it's probably a good idea to study up on Marxism as well. I say that because it's 100% Marxist culture destroying our society. \n\nBut you gotta understand Marxism is one hell of an opiate. Natural law IS SUPERIOR, but to truly understand you'll have to allow yourself to become vulnerable and try to really see things from their perspective. They're actually extremely intelligent and more capable than we'd ever like to believe, but it's imperative to know that in reality, when Marxist theory is used correctly, it's a destructive force. DON'T PERISH ALONGB WITH IT! The goal is to gain understanding without becoming a victim. And speaking from experience, it might be a little easier said than done.",
