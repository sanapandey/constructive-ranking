    "selftext": "Because humans have a crab mentality. We are not only selfish. We also compete with other humans for rare resources, mates, etc. Getting rid the more competent competitors are an effective ways to do so. \n\nDEI, income taxes, and Holocaust, and so on are motivated by that. Not going to say those are right or wrong but many people supported those sort of things. \n\nAnd commies are not the only ones complaining about inequality. \n\nMany of you are not commies. Fine. \n\nBut what do you think of a rich guy that has 10 spouses and 50 children? \n\nNot even libertarian people think it should be fine. \n\nIn fact there are so many laws that make those extremely and legally difficult. When crabs can vote they vote to make success difficult for other crabs. \n\nLife, for whatever reason, is not zero sum game like commies say. But it's far more zero sum than what libertarians believe. \n\n",

That is the precise reason why it's legally impossible.",
