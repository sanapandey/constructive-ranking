I'm not going to link it to avoid brigading accusations, but good lord the comments there are a stark reminder of how far we have to go.\n\nScores of comments about how it's all because people wanting the DoEd eliminated are \"brainwashed\" \"morons\" \"evil\" \"want poor kids to stay poor\" \"rich people want more money\" \"privatize everything so that they can take more of your money and keep people dumb and poor\" and my favorite \"they want control so their kids don't have to learn about the sins of this country and about POC and LGBTQIA+ individuals\" \n\nIt's astounding the wildly superficial level of thought that goes into rebuttals.

And while standards of achievement are good, they should be private. And how the school attempts to meet those achievements is allowed to be flexible and different. Not through strict conformity with a single model that must be followed or else.\n\nThe way this often works is they will issue a new program goal like having an onsite social worker (social workers being leftist political activists) in all schools. They will then issue significant grants either to schools or to the state (especially if the state makes it mandatory across all schools in the state) who conform with this guideline. After many schools follow the guideline, the state will make it requisite for some other benefit before eventually making it mandatory. \n\nOver time, we've seen this slow creep of increased requirements for various assistants, counselors, speech, IEP coaches, ENL translators, life coaches, etc. There has been an explosion in \"Administrators\" in relation to teachers. Meanwhile neither teacher pay nor student outcomes have improved.\n\nLarry Sharpe in NY talks about how there are schools where just to meet the basic requirements mandated by the Feds for the state to continue getting federal dollars, the school is starting their budget process already in the red, with no money for any local endeavors. Everything they want to accomplish, from gym equipment to building expansion to whatever, must be applied for govt grants to accomplish.\n\nLarry's goal as part of running for governor was to stop taking federal $$ so that they could drop the federal requirements and allow local schools to adapt and handle local needs better. \n\nCorey DeAngelis is one to follow on twitter to better understand the reason why so many hate public schools in general and federal DoEd specifically.",
