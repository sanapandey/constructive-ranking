It used to be Pelosi but she\u2019s slowed down a lot after losing her speakership. And now that USAID is cut off, they will need to work harder\n\nWho do they have that can draw donations? Bernie Sanders?\n\nWho is pushing policy? David Hogg?\n\nWho is coordinating legislation? Hakeem Jeffries?\n\nWho are the young up and comers? Who is their young energetic \u201cvoice of the people?\u201d This used to be Corey Booker. Is it now AOC?\n\nWho are their top intellectuals/ pundits driving the media narrative and debating their ideas? Bill Maher and Jon Stewart?\n\nWho is on their bench for president? Kamala has a huge lead currently. Shapiro?\n\nIdk when was the last time we saw such a thorough collapse. They\u2019re rudderless. They\u2019ve got nothing to present to the people. I think they were always propped up by all the BS that Trump is now cutting. It was all fake\n\nI would argue that the American left has been the biggest obstacle to personal liberty in the last 25 years. Now they\u2019re basically gone, and we have a chance to build something new. Maybe the new second party should be a Liberty Party? This is the chance to steer the conversation towards Anarchy",

The old power structure is just worried about lining their pockets and the young progressives are just Marxists spouting the same old tired philosophy that has been rejected over and over. Until they find someone who is more of a blue dog and is charismatic they are just going to keep playing the \"WE AREN'T TRUMP\" message and use the media to parrot their talking points. \n\nThe problem is that the DNC ceded the traditional democratic pillars to the populist right. Trump basically talks like a democrat from the 90s and that is popular with average people. \n\nBasically, Republicans are more conservative democrats from the 90s and Democrats are Marxists.",

In fairness, he was picking up the rubble left behind by the end of Neoconservatism in the late 00's... Perhaps Trumpism needs to \"run its course\" for at least another four years and collapse on its own internal contradictions before some transformational figure re-emerges from the other side of the aisle...",

But we see an extreme reaction to that back in the other direction now.\n\nObama and Clinton before him were arguably popular because they governed from a position of \"center left\". They broadly supported the pro-market \"neoliberal\" post-cold-war consensus, just \"tweaked\" towards direction of social programs and regulations, etc more so than the \"neoconservatives.\"",

Dumb people don't understand that sometimes things are complicated, they like catch phrases and absolute statements. Saying \"It's going to be tough and it might not be perfect\" doesn't get votes from dummies, but \"It's so simple, I'll fix it all on day one, all of it\" that's how you get those 90iq votes.",

This isn't necessarily a comment on individuals who identify as D or R\n\nIt is though. You referred to republicans as having \"weak minds.\" Democrats are particularly known also for making heretics of people who deviate from their orthodoxy and to engage in censorship which is direct evidence that their minds don't form their own thoughts and they do have people telling them what to say.",

They do repeat talking points like any party would, and they are really bad at it. Probably because they really want to use their own words, but they're trying to appear unified because low information voters are drawn to the consistency. \n\nA good current example is John Fetterman, he doesn't always tow the party line and does receive chiding from the top levels of the party, but he's still considered a Democrat by all. Contrast that with the immediate attempts to excommunicate anyone that shows disloyalty to a particular person.",

If you say \"My body, my choice\" for abortion then tell people they have to take a vaccine to not hurt others, there's not a consistent principle there (and you can say the opposite for conservatives). Likewise for \"trust the science,\" and \"sexual dimorphism isn't real.\"\n\n>A good current example is John Fetterman, he doesn't always tow the party line and does receive chiding from the top levels of the party, but he's still considered a Democrat by all.\u00a0\n\nI think Fetterman's situation is still being determined. Trump's coalition that won the election was made-up largely of ex-democrats though. Gabbard, RFK Jr., Rogan, etc. And these are people who were recently democrats, Gabbard and Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\n>Contrast that with the immediate attempts to excommunicate anyone that shows disloyalty to a particular person.\n\nTrump obviously ends up in a lot of petulant personal beefs with people, that's true. But his own MAGA base has separated from him on vaccines, H1B visas, and gay marriage, but they still are considered a bloc otherwise.",
