Every society has done this unethical and unprofitable business. The north just favored a market form of slavery before realizing that wasn't productive either with indentured servitude or company towns, people come work for you voluntarily, but are subject to your terms and conditions and give up their freedom. \n\nI also feel like people not from the South don't realize just how exploitative the sharecropping system was. Slavery, but you steal money from your slaves and don't have to house or feed them. The coercive power of the state allowed this structure to exist because they trapped the sharecroppers with \"debt\"",
