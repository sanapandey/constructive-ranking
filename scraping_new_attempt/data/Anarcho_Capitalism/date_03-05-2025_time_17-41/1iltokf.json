My ideas are simpler and more aimed at creating autonomous private cities like Prospera instead of a whole new country right away.\n\nI think eminem domain is not that bad to be honest. But I am open to other solutions.\n\nI think path toward more and more freedom should be like expevolu. It should be based on experience instead of pure theoretical, it should evolve, the smaller the change the better, and it should be relatively voluntary than alternatives. By winning votes instead of waging war, is relatively voluntary and peaceful in my book.\n\n\n\n# 2) The Holdout Problem\n\nThe situation, however, is even worse because of something called \u201cthe holdout problem.\u201d Here is a GPT-4 explanation of the concept:\n\n*In the world of land acquisition for large-scale projects, the holdout problem presents itself when an individual or a group of landowners, realizing the essential need of their land for the project's success, demand a price far exceeding the market value.*\n\n*Picture a situation where a corporation wants to build a new factory. To do so, they need to acquire a large contiguous piece of land made up of numerous smaller plots owned by different individuals. Each owner, knowing that without their specific plot the factory can't be built, might hold out, refusing to sell unless they get a price significantly above the market rate. This is where the term \"holdout problem\" comes from.*\n\n*Here's an in-depth look at the holdout problem:*\n\n***Context***\n\n*The holdout problem is often seen in situations involving collective action, such as land assembly or infrastructure development, where a single project requires the aggregation of numerous separately owned pieces of property. A classic example is the construction of a railway line or highway that needs to pass through several privately owned lands.*\n\n***Issue***\n\n*The issue arises when one or more property owners refuse to sell at the offered price, holding out for a higher price. They can do this because they understand that their land is vital for the project, giving them considerable bargaining power. They essentially hold the project hostage, hoping to extract a higher payment from the buyer.*\n\n*The holdout problem can lead to significant inefficiencies. For example, projects might be delayed or even abandoned because of one or more holdouts, which can result in considerable social and economic costs. Alternatively, projects might be rerouted or redesigned to avoid dealing with holdouts, but this can lead to suboptimal outcomes, such as less efficient transportation routes or increased costs.*",

Im sure any project can always be much more efficient if everyone agrees (or is forced to agree) to contribute their part for no cost. \n\nRealistically, property owners are only going to hold out if they have another opportunity for the land that is willing to offer them a greater RoI. From an efficiency standpoint, the greater demand behind the alternative opportunity implies that is the more efficient use for it in the big picture.\n\n\u201cThe holdout problem\u201d is only a problem for violent actors pursuing total economic control",

As explained in the text, in order to buy land to create a country an individual would have to agregate a gigantic number of properties. \n\nThere is a real market failure associated with this situation, generally referred to as 'Tragedy of the Anticommons'. From wikipedia: \n\n\"The two 'tragedies' may be compared as follows:\n\u2022 The 'tragedy of the\u00a0commons' occurs when a resource has many users, none of whom own it, and thus none of whom have the ability to exclude others from using it, leading to the\u00a0over-utilization of that resource.\n\u2022 The 'tragedy of the\u00a0anticommons' occurs when a resource has many owners, all of whom have the ability to exclude others from using it, leading to the\u00a0under-utilization of that resource. \n\n... The model was formalized by\u00a0James M. Buchanan\u00a0and Yong Yoon.\" \n\nI do agree that the solution of denying the ability of property owners to veto the sale of their own properties is potentially problematic, but there is a real market failure problem that needs to be overcome for new countries to be established in owned land. \n\nImagine you have to buy every single one of 1000 properties to establish your country, under normal property rules. Even if you could triple the productivity of the area with your new country, how confident would you be that you would be able to buy all the required thousand properties?",

In this context the holdout problem is more damning, so some way to deal with the issue may be required.
