Rates of psychiatric treatment remained significantly higher for at least four years.1,3\n> \n> Rate of hospitalization after abortion compared to childbirth\n> \n> In a study of post-abortion patients only 8 weeks after their abortion, researchers found that 44% complained of nervous disorders, 36% had experienced sleep disturbances, 31% had regrets about their decision, and 11% had been prescribed psychotropic medicine by their family doctor. (2) A 5 year retrospective study in two Canadian provinces found significantly greater use of medical and psychiatric services among aborted women. Most significant was the finding that 25% of aborted women made visits to psychiatrists as compared to 3% of the control group. (3) Women who have had abortions are significantly more likely than others to subsequently require admission to a psychiatric hospital. At especially high risk are teenagers, separated or divorced women, and women with a history of more than one abortion. (4)\n> \n> Since many post-aborted women use repression as a coping mechanism, there may be a long period of denial before a woman seeks psychiatric care. These repressed feelings may cause psychosomatic illnesses and psychiatric or behavioral in other areas of her life. As a result, some counselors report that unacknowledged post-abortion distress is the causative factor in many of their female patients, even though their patients have come to them seeking therapy for seemingly unrelated problems.

I am 100% saying you don't get to dictate the choices other people make. That isn't Anarcho, that is fascist right winger bs. \n\n> Besides, you misunderstand my point. I absolutely agree that you should be able to do whatever you want to your own body.

You have not actually made any kind of refutation to anything I\u2018ve said, you have simply accused me of being a fascist. Even regarding my main point, you just compared me to being a racist, and called it doubling down on my argument without even addressing it. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to address it, just stop responding. Otherwise, actually address the points I\u2019m making. My primary point is that an unborn child is not simply an extension of you, and is thus something separate. It should follow from your own principles that you cannot decide what to do with its body then. Also, you completely ignored the point after I asked that first question about dictating what happens to other people.\n\nI should also add something else. It seems from your beliefs that you probably value freedom as a primary virtue. Let me then ask you this. Do I have the freedom to restrict your freedom. If so, then your freedom has been restricted. If not, then my freedom has been restricted. As with tolerance, freedom on its own cannot act as a sole moral virtue, as it is self-contradictory. The NAP itself is an example of such a restriction. An arbitrary one at that, but still a contradiction to freedom itself.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to respond, don\u2019t make snarky comments about snippets of my reply, just actually respond to it.

And this is really just in the last decade that that is even technologically possible. Almost no 5 month 0 day infants go on to live normal healthy lives.",
