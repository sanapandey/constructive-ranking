Don't you think that capitalism just transfers the power from the government to the wealthy few? \n\nSo authority remains concentrated but in the hands of the wealthy instead of the hands of \"elected\" officials. \n\nThe way I personally see it is that government is bad, but oligarchy is much worse. \n\nSo how do you reconcile anarchy and neoliberal capitalism?",

All those regulations and hoops to jump through serve to keep big corporations in power while curbstomping any potential competition to outgrow them, because the big corps can more easily comply with arbitrary through their monetary power, contrary to the small local entrepreneur.\n\nEdit for clarity.",

In a system such as this if a rich guy tries to hire and army and conquer territories or steal from other people the justice system will mark him as an enemy, and everyone will see him as an enemy doing something immoral and try to stop him if possible. In independent justice system such as religion based or common law based laws arise from a set of basic principles which can not be modified by law makers, like they used to say in ancient Europe \"Gods law is above the kings law\". There are historical instances of kings loosing trials to commoners for example.\n\nMeanwhile in a statist system where the state is god and they make the laws, all the rich guy has to do is bribe some politicians for them to change the law and allow him to use violence as he sees fit. Morality is irrelevant in this system because the word of the state is law and apparently politicians decide what is good or evil.",

At least they can\u2019t prevent it unless they have some leverage of authority in the system which then may well be counter to the anarchist principles.  Let me qualify\u2026\n\nNow, can there be a system in which arbitration and mediation happen in a voluntary group that comes together and agrees to such rules?  I can see that.  How that exactly happens and how much that is decentralized vs entering into a form of government is an interesting conversation.\n\nBut just a non-agreed upon system of rando people and what you suggest?  I don\u2019t see it.",

I\u2019m speaking in this case of anarcho-communists.  You can go into my profile and see the sub if you want.\n\nMany too often think there is no government at all and I think what you are describing many social scientists would agree these are forms of government but heavily decentralized.  It, however, is not a State or Nation State in which I would argue certainly most anarchists oppose.\n\nThis following part of your comment I do believe starts to fit a third party that is agreed upon by parties as some sort of authoritative mediator.  Now keep in mind I\u2019m not saying that in regards to rule society and as a gotcha.  This is me making sense of how the system works in my world needing some hierarchy in which parties agree to settle conflicts:\n\n>they also have escrow and arbitrarion systems to resolve disputes.

I\u2019ve only claimed a couple times but always ended up getting my money back and it was easier and faster than claiming it from aliexpress or similar places.\n\nFair mediation is crucial in systems as it builds trust.  You then expand on this concept with the following:\n\n>Another historical example could be the law system of early middle age europe, different groups of people (merchants, noblement, craftsment, students, etc) had their own legal system made by different enitities (merchant guilds, etc) and a representant of each group would negotiate with the others if there was a problem between people from different law systems.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a history nerd and this is a rather idealized take.  None of these groups were independent from what I know and were subjects of the King - the King\u2019s justice.  They didn\u2019t have their \u201cown justice\u201d.  I\u2019m sure many did do their own vigilante style justice.  But I don\u2019t think you want to be receiving end of that justice or the King\u2019s in those days.  Some probably did their \u201cown justice\u201d for a plethora of reasons and many not so noble.  Some probably were noble to keep someone they cared about from being hanged or quartered by the King\u2019s executioner.",

Which depending on the system you would have to pay. I heard about a trial system where 3 judges had to be chosen each party of the trial chose a judge and the third one had to be agreed and paid for by both parties, in this system for example the trial and justice system is a service being hired by the parts in conflict, nothing is imposed and no one has a monopoly on the judges or the justice system, so it would not be considered a form of government.\n\nAnd about the medieval period part, yes the kings justice was prevalent for most cases, but weren't there some law systems above the king's law? I read that Lex Mercatoria was applierd through all Europe and was above the law of each kingdom, I also remember that in some kingdoms the king's law had to be based in a previus legal base that was considered to come \"from god\" and be above the king, such as the common law for example, what do you know about this?",

At the start of the new millennium, the shift to mobile computing created a boom of decentralized production and services. Think Etsy, Uber, Air B&B to say nothing of the small businesses like roofers and restaurants that were able to pull business from the big chains. These things ebb and flow, mainly in response to tastes and available technology and they move in opposite directions at the same time all the time.",
