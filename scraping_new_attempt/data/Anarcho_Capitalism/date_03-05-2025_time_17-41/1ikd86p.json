Then they want to say they respect the deer while posting pics grinning ear to ear holding up the dead head is asinine. \n\nLet the real predators do the work they were designed to do and mark humans respect what it means to go into nature. We need to understand that nature is a brutal place that must be given that respect. We can\u2019t just go out and kill anything with claws and bug teeth just because we\u2019re a little scared.

That includes my animals.  Human life is valued just like any other scarce resource, by its marginal utility.\n\nEvery time an idiot tries to paint some homeowner who put a bullet into the dipshit who broke into his house as evil by proclaiming \"you value your stuff more than human life\", the correct response is always \"no, the thief did, I just agreed with them\".",

I'm not an individualist utilitarian where the value of a human is determined by how much one personally values them. Marginal utility is primarily economic to me while this question is an ethical one. It seems to me that God's valuation of man supersedes our valuation of man, so such valuations are still grounded in a mind, and a necessarily existing one that is Goodness itself at that.",

Nassim Taleb popularized the idea of the \"intellectual, yet Idiot\" in his book 'The Black Swan'.\n\nWe are all idiots to the extent that we all have blind-spots that we fail to acknowledge (in some areas), but some people just happen to be a LOT MORE idiotic than others and a LOT MORE ARROGANT... There's just a massive gap between their perception of their intellect and their actual intellect.\n\nThe most impressive mark of an intelligent person is their ability to identify intelligence in others.\n\nIntelligence is beautiful. Those who can see its beauty won't let their personal feelings (e.g. jealousy) prevent them from acknowledging it when they see it in other people. Their ability to identify intelligence is key to allowing them to become more intelligent themselves. People who cannot identify intelligence in others, cannot become intelligent themselves; after a certain level, they'll become too proud and they'll reach a plateau; they won't be able to identify any external reference points to further improve themselves.\n\nThat said, if you're intelligent, you can definitely tell when other people are idiots. Because you're always looking for a small unique area of genius in everyone and you really want to find it, you want to find that one tiny area where that person is a genius and you want to grasp it, to mirror it upon yourself but sometimes you just can't find anything... It's disappointing. Then when combined with arrogance, the disappointment turns to disgust.",

Many Reddit users from Argentina will tell you that we're on the worst time possible since the Independence or whatever, but it's not true. Just imagine... Having a 50% on wholesale prices PER MONTH, and a debt bomb of about 3 GDPs, ready to explode. Peronists, in order to perpetuate in power, left the worst macroeconomic picture you can imagine, so that Milei couldn't fix it in time (therefore, causing a major discontent on population, and burying classical liberalism for another 100 years).\n\nSo, from having a 50% inflation per month to less than 2% in a single year, yes, we're better. And if someone tells you \"yeah, that's the macro, but you're underestimating the micro\", in my case, I had an increase of my salary of about nearly 220% in 14 months (yes, I was truly undepaid; but I also don't pay taxes nor social contributions because I have undeclared work, because if I do it, I'll earn a little less than half). So much so that I could start to heavily repair my future house that was abandoned and nearly crumbling, and doing it while the inflation keeps lowering, it's a RELIEF.",
