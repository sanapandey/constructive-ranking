If the goal is to promote libertarian thought, engaging with criticism should be a priority rather than an inconvenience. Otherwise, the subreddit functions less as a place for intellectual growth and more as a comfort zone for those who already agree.  \n\nIf users are able to block or ignore people who they disagree with, why is it that moderators then choose to exercise that ability for all other users?  A moderator that curates based on opinion is a central authority dictating the cultural norms of its community.  Does that represent the free market and liberty, or does that more reflect the values of the communities it claims to reject?",

Reddit is a public square forum, particularly the libertarian subreddit who represents the free market and liberty.  Moderators are supposed to be more like referees than gatekeepers.  If a libertarian subreddit claims to value free exchange but removes dissenting voices, it is not acting as a neutral property owner, it is controlling speech in a way that contradicts its stated values.",
