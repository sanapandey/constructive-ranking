[https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/)  \n\nAs for Trump's plans for Gaza, so far there's been one vague statement and no numbers or details so I'll need to see that first before I decide to like or hate it.  Trump flaps his lip a lot and a big chunk of his idle yammer never gets followed up on so it doesn't mean much by itself.  Also sometimes he says things just to piss of the dems and that one certainly fits that bill.   \n\nAnyway, we should not be strawmanning here, there's other legit issues like the tariffs to complain about, please don't spread false information.",
