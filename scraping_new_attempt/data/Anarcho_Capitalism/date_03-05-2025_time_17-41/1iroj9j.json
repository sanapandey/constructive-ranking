Result? Human suffering to protect profit.\n\nThe US pays more per person in health care than any other developed nation. If you look in those other places, *none of them* have found more profit motive increases outcomes. I guess you're free to make that argument, but all you have is precarious theory, right?",

When people see that they can get the same services for drastically less money (while the doctors get the same amount they always got) they will flock to it and away from outrageously expensive insurance or life-long debt. Doctors will have to follow along if they want customers.\n\n\\>And who foots the bill for those without enough to cover?\n\nSmith tells the story of a man who needed surgery so his church raised the funds to get it at his clinic, and when he found out that that was the case he waved the charges. That's just one possibility, but the point is that most people are not inhuman monsters. The only thing I am against is not being able to decide for myself who should get my help and who should not.",

This includes lifesaving treatments and interventions. The high costs of these treatments make no sense from a free market perspective because what profit is there to be gained if most people can\u2019t afford it. The only reason why big Pharma and Healthcare can get away with these costs is because the government has created a system through Medicare where costs are ultimately determined by the insurance companies and more accurately the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

When that happened, it would be incredibly profitable for a company with fatter margins to absorb the profitable policies\", trim the fat of revunue negative policies, and it would leave people out of the system. Which means we either let them die, or there's always some expenditure that has to be covered by someone else.\n\nI recognize free market forces. They are valuable in many things, and have a place in finding solutions. But there are examples when the profit motive moves power from the \"good\" companies to the bad ones, and push out those with margins they keep thinner.\n\nA free market is like a perfect union, it doesn't actually exist, it's just a destination we move towards. Many markets need to be unregulated for sure, but some markets will fail the human experience if left wide open. And, so far as I can see, for anything for which there is a human *need*, the profit motive becomes hard to work in because people do not have the option to remove their demand.\n\nTake social media. Zero regulations on starting a new social media site, or data farm, aside from trademarks. Why is there such a concentration of power and market share? Meta, Google, TikTok and Amazon control almost all of the market share. Every few years, a new site may come up, but someone buys it out. The market remains cornered.\n\nLike I can't get away from Bezos. Even if I don't shop Amazon, he supplies people I do, and my data goes through AWS countless times a day whether I like it or not. Can I start my own warehouse services? Sure. Can I offer the speed and reliability as they can, working at scale? I cannot. The burden of entry isn't regulation, it's the ability to compete. That doesn't mean they're offering the best service at the best price possible, just that they have enough capital to absorb anyone else who manages to find a foothold.\n\nUS Healthcare is fucked because we have regulations to protect the interests of insurance companies. Why we pay 4x more than other countries with national health care. The currency system *benefits* insurance companies. Handing them the power is not going to make behave *better*, right?",
