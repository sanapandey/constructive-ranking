    "selftext": "We have all heard muh roads 1000s of times, and how very important the state is regarding police, military and fire department, because people can't seem to wrap their minds around private entities doing any of these, even though private options already exist for most of them. What is a funny or annoying argument that stood out to you because it was so different from the rest? I think the most unique one I heard is someone telling me unless you have been on the front lines in a war, you don't have any room to talk about whether violence is necessary because you can't understand violence. This came from someone who has never been in the military, and probably not even a real 1 v 1 fight that wasn't for fun or sport.",

To the contrary, it was founded by people who'd escaped Scandinavia, and Norway in particular, which was becoming more centralized and feudal, thus moving away from its previously localized rulership. These were people who were not on board with becoming chattel serfs. You're just pulling shit out of your ass about nobles running around killing serfs for sport - at least do five minutes of research on the topic at hand if you're going to argue.\n\nAs for your \"what if\" scenario, Iceland used the same feuding system as most of Scandinavia had done for some time already, although feuding was notably less common due to Iceland's legal system being better equipped to handle conflict. No, norse feuding has nothing to do with feudalism. So in your scenario, the murderer would be facing a feud from the victim's extended family and relations - that's a losing proposition for any would-be killer.",
