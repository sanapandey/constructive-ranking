Think: _The New Jim Crow_\n\nIt was and still is a valid critique of American society. A valuable conversation to be had. Also applies towards discrimination and injustice towards LGBT and autistic people.\n\nBut then lazy do-nothing politicians, journalists, and lawyers hijacked this valid point and usurped it into an ideological/cultural/political war in which they assert moral superiority in order to claw at money and power without having to earn it (by, say, making good decisions, being trustworthy, or producing values for society).\n\nBasically the same thing that Religious Funadmentalists do (if you don't agree with our stance and \"donate\" money to our cause then you're evil), but instead of a toxic theistic ideology, it's a toxic humanistic ideology. And instead of church and state being separate, the Woke Parasites are embedded throughout the Governance and Propaganda apparatuses.\n\nThat's the difference between Woke in the original sense and the \"Woke Mind Virus\"",

After going back and trying to find it again, I realized I was incorrect. [Here\u2019s another angle of the video.](https://youtu.be/Tmg7OWLLeYU?si=S6XSNKqrNt_-EngN) both you can clearly hear him ask \u2018Okay, where are we going?\u2019\n\n*Original post below to be shamed*\n\nThere was a video from the field where Trump is taking pictures with the first responders and he walks away and clearly says \u2018they\u2019re booing at me\u2019",

Definitely need much more evidence before I believe the narrative that Fox edited in cheers. Could see the differing broadcasts having mic\u2019s to pick up crowd noise in different places which leads to hearing just what the crowd in that specific area did.",

Yes the headlines now are so deceptive, fox does it but so do many other sources so people only just calling out fox makes it sound like it's only fox, which is also deceptive.  Fox does it but i don't think they are the worst offenders either.  And for sure, many many headlines are just lies now and many videos are being selectively edited to pair answers from one question to a different question or take things out of context or clip out parts that soften an answer.",
