    "selftext": "I know it is still very early into the game, but I am not sure my skepticism or optimism has moved on Trump. I am seeing Trump do/promise libertarian things, even if just as an obligation to the LP that endorsed his ass, then go straight back into being '16 Orange Jesus again.\n\nI have a friend of mine that I have known since sixth grade, and him and I have been going back and forth with Trump. Him and I have complaints, but most of the time they are opposite complaints. He did not believe Ross Ulbricht should have been freed at all, and I beg to differ. Anyways, it has been very fortunate and useful to have him chime in about Trump to keep me accountable towards Trump from a principled standpoint. I have noticed sometimes I can praise Trump as a Libertarian, hell once or twice as an Anarchist, but other times I see Trump being worse than Biden was. Very inconsistent.\n\nMy friend and I also went over Project 2025 back in June or July last year. P2025 is basically what [user from another group] would have absolutely creamed his pants for: a Christian Nationalist functioning Federal Minarchy. That is what it was looking for.\n\nBut let me stick with Trump for now, and I will make it easy. How about a list that can reflect '24 Trump?\n\n\u2022 Creating DOGE \u2705\n\u2022 Corporate Imperial taking of Greenland and others \u274c\n\u2022 Ending income taxes \u2705\n\u2022 Replacing them with tariffs \u274c\n\u2022 Ending the Dept of Ed \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\u2022 Occupying Gaza and promising Zionist boy Nety to do an ethnic cleansing of the strip \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\nAnd this is my on-going battle about Trump. Half of his shit says reformed Paleolibertarian, the other half says '16 right-wing Obama on steroids. How am I, a Hoppean/Reactionary Anarcho-Capitalist, supposed to feel about '24 Trump?\n\n\u2022 Release Ross Ulbricht \u2705\n\u2022 Support introducing AI vaccines \u274c\n\nHow am I supposed to take this seriously *in either way or perspective*?\n\nAnyways, consider this my February 2025 thoughts on the \"nEw AnD iMpRoVeD\" Donald J. Trump.\n\n- your friendly neighborhood Hoppean, Lord Vulkruss ",

I was called a \"Larken Rose Anarchist\" for being very skeptical of Trump. This sort of phenomenon is why I judge each individual policy and view of an official instead of just blindly making a catch-all opinion.\n\nInteresting irony to note: the group of friends that support Trump so strongly also shredded Milei as a CIA plant and an Israeli shill.",

As I mentioned in the post, my analysis was very early and, because a strictly principled Hoppean analysis would be 1/5 the size of this post, more than fair towards Trump. These posts will be on-going updates/thread until we get towards the end of the term.\n\nIf I were to analyze any politician strictly principled by my Hoppean beliefs, even Thomas Massie, Justin Amash, and Spike Cohen would catch negatives. My act of \"fair analysis\" towards a politician is Hoppean in the background and Korwinist/Paleolibertarian in the foreground.\n\nThis is not *specifically* Hoppean because it is so early. Most often, especially with the Libertarians and Republicans, us Hoppeans actually agree with sentiments, but of course highly disagree with practice. The Paleolibertarian and Conservative sentiments to Anti-Communism and restrictive borders are fantastic sentiments, but a strictly Hoppean reaction would be a complete disagreement in the practice of socialism and government.\n\nTL;DR- Too early to get *specifically* Hoppean in my analysis, a strictly Hoppean analysis would be 1/5 the size of the post with zero positives, and it is not bootlicking if I praise good policies that even AnCaps/Hoppeans would desire. Yes, I do have to put my Hoppean perspectives in the background a bit, but they will be present.",

That's even more important with Trump, because he just throws so much shit at the wall, just to see what sticks. Sometimes, it even looks like deliberate distractions strategies. While everybody's up in arms about Greenland, Panama or Gaza, he's onto something else. Calling up Putin, signing executive orders.\n\nSo, save the judgement till a year or two in. Meanwhile, enjoy the woke meltdowns, butthurt left and European cry-baby politicians.",
