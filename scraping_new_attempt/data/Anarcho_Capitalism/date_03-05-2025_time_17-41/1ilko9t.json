    "selftext": "r/FBI didn't like this and deleted it on their sub. \n\nTo the Former Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi),\n\n\nAs a citizen of a unified Germany, I write to you not with hatred, but with a heavy heart and a deep desire for accountability. The shadow of your oppressive regime continues to linger over the lives of countless East Germans, even after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of our nation.\n\n\nFor years, you infiltrated our lives, turning neighbors against neighbors, silencing dissent, and fostering a climate of fear through your pervasive surveillance. The knowledge that our most private thoughts and actions were meticulously documented in your files is a wound that has yet to fully heal.\nWhile some former Stasi members have faced justice, the vast majority have not. The full truth about your operations, the extent of your cruelty, and the names of those who suffered under your watch must be brought to light. The victims deserve to know the full story, to understand the depth of the injustice they endured, and to finally find closure.\n\n\nThe process of confronting our past is not easy, but it is necessary for a truly unified Germany. By acknowledging the wrongs committed by the Stasi, we can begin to heal the divisions that still exist within our society, and ensure that such a dark chapter never repeats itself.\nI urge you, as individuals who were once part of this oppressive system, to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations, to come forward with information, and to publicly acknowledge the harm you caused. Only through transparency and accountability can we truly move forward as one nation.",
