Congress is supposed to Earmark everything. Too long they've sat on their ass and just tossed money to bureaucrats. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully we'll see soon. I'm praying Trump is not a retard who will defy the courts and will let the SCOTUS decide this (cause it involves unchallenged statutes on the books).",

Trump isn't dumb. He's an egomaniac and a blowhard, but part of that is an act. Plus, after the shellacking he took for the last 8 years from the Establishment, I'd half expect him to hold a LOT of resentment and (hopefully) being advised to play it strategically. Democrats have shown, time and again, to be inveterate asswipes who cannot leave well enough alone. I warned my Lefty friends that if they kept pushing the Abortion at Any Time no matter Viability, it would bite them in the ass. And it did. \n\n  \nFor all his faults (and he has A LOT, on top of being a scumbag in general) shithead Mitch McConnell warned a bunch of them back when he was the Junior Senator that the Republicans would eat the Dems lunch for what they did to Bork back in the 80s (no thanks to drunkard fucktard Ted Kennedy and kid-sniffer Joe Biden). Trump gave that to them and his changing the court has upended a lot of previously accepted stuff. Revenge is a dish best served cold.",
