Even if you could prove that, net, the government does more harm than good, it would still be a system of coercion and extortion, and immoral. That's what anarchists believe.\n\nEdit: meant \"if you could prove the government does more good than harm\"",

There is a difference between the pragmatic argument (the pros outweigh the cons) and the principled argument (the justification is immoral or invalid). You are free to use both arguments, but just because someone makes the pragmatic argument against a government policy doesn't mean that there isn't also a principled argument against it as well.",

There's no way if someone with a liberal value-based world view looked at USAID earnestly and decided it was something they want to exist to the point of activism on their own time!\n\nI've seen the conservative calls for the most ridiculous things, but the fact is conservatives reject them. There was a bill put forward in some state to basically make it illegal for guys too \"you know what\" if they're not actively trying to make a baby. Conservatives by and large are like \"No man not a chance.\" When some conservatives started trying to ban IVF Trump actually came out and said he thought not only was it a good thing but it should be paid for by medicaid!  And conservatives agreed with him!  Yeah we've got our crazies but we don't follow them.  But liberals will get right on board with defending USAID?",

According to the Heritage Foundation, a US conservative think tank, the collaboration between USAID and Soros\u2019 OSF was cemented in 2009, when OSF was reportedly made the \u201cmain implementer\u201d of USAID\u2019s foreign aid programs. However, evidence shows that this partnership began well before that.\n\nIn 1993, a USAID document reveals that the agency first collaborated with the Soros Foundations\u2019 Management Training Program to train 30 professionals from Bulgaria, Estonia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, signaling the beginning of a long-running alliance. This early collaboration laid the groundwork for a more extensive network of Soros-affiliated organizations working alongside USAID in Eastern Europe.\"",

Its not a choice, war with no name African country 47 or bribing them with 'gifts' that were taken by force from our own people's wallets. Lets do neither of these things ! Lets win their friendship by letting them do what they want, and leaving them alone, and get rid of trade restrictions and tariffs, so our companies can go over and freely provide jobs there, making and importing the things we need here. And if YOU want to provide AIDS relief to Africa, go right ahead, its right there, just don't send over your goons with Government Guns, to take the money from ME, by FORCE, (and it IS taken by force, since I was born here, but never consented to this system I am force to pay into) so you can feel good about spending my money over there.\n\nEdit : Also, 'doing good' is a subjective assessment of the situation. I personally feel that my money could do a lot more good in my pocket, paying to maintain my car and home, rather than funding some NGO thousands of miles away, that might be using it for hookers and blow, for all I know. The corruption in Africa is insane, and this aid money might actually be doing more harm than good, if it ends up indirectly paying for more wars in foreign lands. I just feel that individuals should be allowed to decide for themselves if these programs are good uses of our money or not, and the way it is structured now, I have no say, beyond my one vote in 300 million, and usually both the R and D Uniparty members support this foreign aid, so this issue has actually never been on the ballot, and even in this last election, I had only a vague idea that some things would be cut, so I still have no real say in how my money is spent.",

In general I believe US Aid has done considerable work, as an army veteran myself I have worked along side US Aid personnel and seen some of the incredible work done and seen lives being saved by the organization on multiple fronts.",

That's right. That work obscures the shady shit. Probably.  I use the word \"probably \" because I have direct evidence.  There are articles making accusations from media agencies around the world. Statist media isn't necessarily raring and ready to write an article that would create bad press.",

The history of USAID' involvement in military operations up to and including regime change should not have surprised anyone and is what I relied on for my question. That should have been good enough.

Most likely the latter. \n\nI just saw a poll on a military sub in which over 70% of the votes were against eliminating USAID. \n\nUnfortunately, this sub isn't allowing me to share the link. But, I imagine one would get the same response from most service members, in one place or another. \n\nThis is because USAID is not just a charity. If Trump doesn't want to waste money, great. Don't. One can cut programs and expenditures without eliminating the agency in of itself. Just because the last mechanic was bad doesn't mean you throw out the tool set.\n\nBecause that is what USAID is: a tool. \n\nAnd it serves national security with economic leverage, ground intelligence, networking, and building strategic alliances overseas. \n\nMusk is very well aware of this. \n\nUSAID wasn't created to send terrorists condoms. \n\nSpeaking on it's \"charitable\" activities, there may in fact be times, where it may be ethical, and recommended to address certain humanitarian needs.\n\nOne example is with challenged countries under U.S. ownership, such as in the Caribbean. Or rebuilding infrastructure we destroy. \n\nOr for an example of ground intelligence, and trust ideally, building a hospital in Gaza, or starting a business in Cairo or Abu Dhabi (radicalist hubs) to $upply the military with intelligence. \n\nThere is probably a lot of international workers kind of wondering if they just got laid off by the president too. USAID is a means of inevitable international trade and livelihood. \n\nAnd for most regular people, workers, and entrepreneurs alike, it is a means of navigating what is often an expensive and confusing terrain. So investing and working overseas is going to be much more difficult, unless one has expertise, connections, and/or money. \n\nGod forbid we have any interest in any other country besides America, or want to help vulnerable people, though. \n\nI hope some people enjoy their new incest economy. Some of us will still do what they can to enjoy the rest of the  world. But I thought you should know that Musk himself knows the value and purpose of USAID, he's just red pill conning everyone, and consolidating power.",
