And don't think of escaping; they can remove your passports and force friendly countries to deport you one way or another.\n\nGiven this reality (and it is happening now in Ukraine, with male Ukrainians not getting their passport renewed), what would you do to prevent this to affect you? Double nationality? Living in a country that's enemy of yours, so that you can always escape by claiming refugee status?",

You learn basic life skills which people are missing out on glued to their iPhones.\n\n\u2014- GPT\n\n\nAs of March 2025, several European countries maintain mandatory military service for young people. The specifics of conscription, including duration and eligibility, vary by country. Here\u2019s an overview:\n\nCountries with Mandatory Military Service:\n\n\t1.\tAustria: All able-bodied male citizens up to 35 years old are required to serve six months in the military. Conscientious objectors can opt for nine months of civilian service.  \ufffc\n\n\t2.\tCyprus: All men are required to complete 14 months of military service.  \n\t\n3.\tDenmark: Conscription is mandatory for all physically fit men over the age of 18, with approximately 4,700 conscripts undergoing basic training annually. The government aims to increase this number to 5,000 per year.  \ufffc\n\n\t4.\tEstonia: Healthy men between the ages of 18 and 28 are required to serve 8 to 11 months in the military, depending on their education and position.  \ufffc\n\n\t5.\tFinland: All male citizens are obligated to serve either 6, 9, or 12 months in the military, depending on the specific duties assigned. Women may serve voluntarily.  \ufffc\n\n\t6.\tGreece: Mandatory military service of 12 months is enforced for all adult men.  \ufffc\n\n\t7.\tLatvia: Compulsory national defense service was reintroduced in 2023. Males born after January 1, 2004, are subject to mandatory service, while both males and females aged 18 to 27 can apply voluntarily. The service includes military and alternative (civil) options.  \ufffc\n\n\t8.\tLithuania: Military service affects men aged 19 to 26, who must complete a 9-month period.  \ufffc\n\n\t9.\tNorway: Employs a form of mandatory military service for both men and women. While many are called for examination, only those motivated are selected, resulting in about 8,000 to 10,000 conscripts annually.  \ufffc\n\n\t10.\tSweden: Military service was reintroduced in 2017 for both men and women, with conscripts serving 9 to 12 months.  \ufffc\n\nRecent Developments:\n\t\n\u2022\tCroatia: Announced plans to reintroduce a two-month compulsory military service starting January 1, 2025, in response to regional tensions.  \ufffc\n\t\n\u2022\tSerbia: Decided to reintroduce compulsory military service for men, 14 years after its abolition. The new program includes 60 days of training and 15 days of exercises, with service remaining voluntary for women.  \ufffc\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that conscription policies can change based on political, social, and security considerations. For the most current information, consulting official government sources or recent publications is recommended.",
