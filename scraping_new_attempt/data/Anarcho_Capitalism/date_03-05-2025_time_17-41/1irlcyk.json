However, it's interesting to see that the number of living people recorded in the Census follows the same general curve as the DOGE Count, but in every age range, the DOGE Count is significantly higher. In my view, its a significant difference, but not as extreme as  it seem sat first, but still clear signs of major issues\n\nThe differences I can think of are, since the Census tracks living people, some individuals known to Social Security may have already passed away, but their records have not yet been updated (system inefficiencies lagging behind real time). The DOGE Count is more accurate at younger ages but progressively gets further apart as records get older, which probably shows errors accumulating over time. This also supports the idea that deaths are not always being properly updated in Social Security records.\n\nThe Census only tracks people currently living in the U.S., so the Social Security records might also include people who have moved but never properly sent notification. There is also likely a bias since people have a incentive to register with Social Security but not for the Census. While some variance should be expected insuch a large scale count, the bigger question in my mind is not just why these differences exist (since they might be explained largely by outdated, inaccurate and  lagging records) but rather what is happening with these outdated records? I find it hard to believe that if these records are inaccurate, that there are no actual payments being made that shoudlnt be.\n\nEven if a small percentage of that difference is incorrect, it is much larger than it seems. Maybe only 15% of that 20% over count is getting checks they shouldn't, thats still 10M people. Lets say they only received $100 each, we would still be in the billion dollar range, and its probably much worse than that. Even if its not cash, just the mailings, paperwork, and labor dealing with that many bad records is a huge expense due to outdated, inefficient, unchecked systems\n\nGovernment systems are outdated and inefficient, and full of errors. We all know this if you have ever had to deal with them. As a business that contracts with government, I have to keep a fax line as there are some situations fax is the only method I am allowed use. These systems are a joke, so regardless of political opinions, I would hope we can all at least agree on that. Even many of the original founders of the country that disagreed with a federal government having power, at least fought for a small but efficient government.",

It seems to follow a similar curve, indicating to me at at least that much of the errors are in its update accurracy as time goes on.\n\nWhat ever  way anybody looks at it, considering we do not have provably accurate counts, and we are getting wide variations from different sources and as compared expected realities, it just proves there are inaccuracies on the magnitude of millions.\n\nRegardless of political biases (whatever team you are on, they are not here for you), I really hope we can at least all see how inefficient the government is. Not only does it appear there are issues with this data, the worst part is we do not have a defendable correct answer. The tusth is, nobody knows.\n\nI personally dont think we SHOULD know. For us to have the accuracy required for proper payments, we would need to have a ultra detailed accounting of all citizens. I dont think this database should exist, and if it were to, I dont think something like that should be in the governments hands, despite the leftists tribalism, or the doge/maga bootlickers cheering that has taken over this sub\n\nUltimately, we are forced to pay taxes through force based government coercion. Nothing offends me more than the money being taken from me so I am unable to use it how I see fit, then somebody else using it for absolute waste and fraud. My hope with all this isnt that it will cause the government to become more accurate in how they take and spend our money, or by having a more accurate database on all US citizens, but hopefully a wakeup call to all the sheep that follow mainstream narratives that **the government is not capable of handling your money for you**",

Sometimes that erroneous and legacy data just continues to persist and is ignored away with footnotes on audit reports. It depends on whether or not the data actually affects day-to-day operations or runs afoul of any laws or regulations.",

In fact, that was kinda the point of this was to show that although it looks shocking to see the people listed over 100 years old in the original list, but overall its not that erroneous. Like you said, seems like what you would expect in a large database. Overall their numbers follow the curve of the Census, and in total its only 20% higher. One thing we can see is that the numbers would seem to be more accurate for younger ages, and get progressively less accurate as records get older, so there are issues and efficiencies to be found. Even just some better check to catch obviously bad records. I would be surprised if its greater than 10% that could be gained, but even though a small percent its a big number that could be in the billions.\n\nOverall my point is that I hope this shows that the government is not better at spending your money than you are, regardless if it a \"good guy\" or \"bad guy\" taking it. I know those two points I make are a bit contradictory. There are both apparently improvable systems that will recover some meaningful costs, and at the same time its not as out of wack as people are making it sound in national news channels. While it looks like improvements can be made, I dont think doing so at the cost of out liberties ins the answer.

But you don't need to know software to sell software anymore than you need to be a mechanic to sell cars. Hell.. Steve Jobs was known as a tech messiah for decades, and he couldn't write a 'Hello, World' script if you held a gun to his head. Bill Gates is one of the exceptions to this, as he was a successful programmer AND businessman - Zuckerberg is another such. Both of them know software and business. Musk only knows business.\n\nSo yes, Musk has made this kind of mistake talking about software before, and it is no surprise that he is doing so again for the purposes of manipulating people who don't know enough about databases to be able to tell he's very likely wrong.",

An insurance plan that hasn't been decided on, or sometimes even when they end up not being used, many of them have a starting date of 1900. it is the default value we use when we don't know. \n\nBecause the origination date is not used to determine coverage, many plans that are \"active\" for say the year 2024, can have an origination date of 1900. \n\nI say we run on a glass foundation, people have no clue how shitty our systems are set up. \n\nHell, credit collections are often done with an excel spreadsheet with only a SSN and how much is owed, maybe a name and phone, but that's it (actually SSN is often left off). It isn't like collection agencies are looking at a database from a credit report agency and working with them to find it, nope, just an excel spreadsheet saying, \"go after these ppl\"",

These are records in tables with data in a programming in language like COBOL where start time is 1875. So if there is no time value set the records are with such values. When you are using a database there could be other fields like active, real, last checked at, deleted at, confirmed at and many others that give you a clear picture about this records. You might have a record for 200 years old person that is active-false, or confirmed at-null, or real-false,. The fact that you have incomplete data does not mean these people are receiving money or something. It means that there are records in a table. In a db administration you don\u2019t delete records, because you break foreign keys constraint and you try to avoid it. Also you lose information that might be subject to audit. So you keep all kinds of records, even invalid and you make them as such.\n\nFor example with a field like deleted at.\n\nSo there could be name-John snow, born-1873, deleted at-1984. \n\nIn one of my platforms I have like 1000 paying companies. There are about 200000 companies records. All of them are invalid. Most got created during a time where the form for companies creation was not working properly. Instead of deleting them you keep a records of them and make most of them as invalid because the effort and risk of deleting them is greater than the effort of marking them as invalid. You could break a lot more things. \n\nEverything is a conspiracy if you don\u2019t know how anything works.",
