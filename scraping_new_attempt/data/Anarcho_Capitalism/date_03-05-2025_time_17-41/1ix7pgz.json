And Trump's FBI Director, Kash Patel, has said that he would go after people in the media and persecute members of the media who have spread misinformation and who have lied to the American people.\n\nAnd in one of Trump's recent executive orders he said that the Attorney General would charge teachers with sex crimes for using their students prefered pronouns. Which regardless of what you think of trans stuff is obviously massive government overreach.",

Presumably he wants to go after some people for breaking the law, especially with regard to election interference?\n\nTeachers, some have clearly been grooming the kids, in which case \"sex crime\" seems an appropriate charge. I doubt they will be charged for using preferred pronounds, though. I couldn't get a clear answer googling yet, but it seems in many places NOT using preferred pronouns would get teachers fired or punished, which is also a massive government overreach.",

Which is also a question of individual liberty. In a country without government regulation Zuckerberg would be free to do with Meta whatever he wants. So that's certainly about individual liberty as well.\n\nAnd Trump threatened to imprison Zuckberg for life for election interference, which even according to current US laws would be ridiculous.\n\nAnd with regards to trans stuff, in one of his executive orders he definitely used language that implied that simply using a student's prefered pronouns could be considered a crime if the student is a minor. And I understand you may have critical views of trans stuff, but if a 16 year old asked a teacher to be referred to by a name and pronoun different from their biological sex, criminally charging a teacher for complying with that would be a massive violation of free speech.",

Pesonally I agree that private companies should be allowed to say what they want (within the limits of free speech). In the end Zuckerberg donated to the inauguration party, so it seems the threat was not that serious.\n\nAs for criminally charging teachers for using prefered pronounds, I would wait to get enraged about that until it actually happens. There is too much fearmongering going on.\n\nIt's also a difficult subject. How DO you effectively protect children from grooming? I don't really like banning certain topics from school completely, but what if it is the only effective solution? Otherwise you can only get into a hellscape of ever more complicated and detailed laws about what can be said in what way under what circumstances, which may simply not be practical. And the fact is a lot of teachers are pushing the ideologie, how do you distinguish them from the ones who merely heed the wishes of 16 year old trans kids?\n\nSchool in itself is a questionable thing if kids are forced to go and government has almost a monopoly on it.",
