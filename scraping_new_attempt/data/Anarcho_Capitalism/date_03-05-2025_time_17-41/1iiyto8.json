And now the same is happening for DOGE.\n\nYou say Milei and DOGE are government, and AnCaps shouldn't cheer for them. Or for any President.\n\nThe way I see it is, your side wants to sit around and do nothing. You have no concept of net positives or reality. You believe a society that's been so dependent on government just needs government abolished on day 1 and no transition is needed. And since you don't support any Presidents, you think the government will somehow abolish itself.\n\nYou say there should be 0 government, but you have no plan for that. And you want that future magically, somehow with no in-between steps/plan.\n\nWhat's your argument about how that's better? And how will it lead to an AnCap society?",

                    "body": "\"Theory craft\" implies that people here actually try to figure out the best way to make a free society. And that's something I've barely seen, a lot of people here seems more interested in having the moral high ground than ACTUALLY implementing ideas.\n\nFor example, I once had a conversation on someone who completely opposed police having any kind of authority to do searchs on people or identify them. Which is stupid because if a security force cannot even know who they are dealing with, they cannot known if that person should be arrested or not. They could've found a guy who has 100 cases of grape, 50 homicides, and is the owner of a human traffic organization, but if they cannot ID him or detain them, they cannot arrest him.\n\nSo I moved the argument and said \"Ok what about if it was a private police force that did those things\", and then he started agreeing with me. So the problem here is not that the police can do that stuff, it's that the police works for a government.\n\nTo give another example more close to home to some. Reddit is a private organization, they have the right to censor anyone they want. Just because they are private am I supposed to endorse or even support that they do ? Sure, I do not advocate for the Government blocking them from doing so. But I'm not gonna support them in destroying dialectics and free exchange of ideas, if anything I'll oppose them, and move on the moment there is a better alternative.\n\nFor a third example, under an Ancap society, nothing hinders socialists from creating their own little socialist Utopia and starving to their heart's contents so long they do it voluntarily and with their propriety. Would I want to live in THAT society ? Hahahahaha NO. If I end up encrouched in such place I'm selling everything and moving the fuck away before the food scarcity begins.",

They give police a special status that they do not grant others.  Police should not exist.  They are not necessary.  Are you familiar with Robert Murphy's conception of voluntary prisons?  The key is to invert the purpose of a prison to be to protect the accused from vigilantes rather than to assume the public must be protected from the accused.",

The problem with increasing government power is that even with good intentions you never know who will take control next or how they\u2019ll use it to align with their agenda. Once a system is in place, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to limit its reach, and history shows that government rarely shrinks, it only grows.

            "body": "Pointless? No\n\nDoomed to failure? Yes\n\nIt is my belief that anarchism can not work within the state, with the state or for the state. \n\nThe state is all consuming and corrupts anything it touches.\n\nWill things get better with them in charge? Sure, maybe and/or probably.\n\nBUT...\n\nWe are anarchists, an inherently revolutionary ideology, and reform is impossible when our ideas are so counter to the purpose and being of the state. It is like trying to make an apple out of an orange.\n\nAnd although things may get better, that is counterproductive to our own ends. If things get better, it will inevitably put the people to sleep, causing stagnation and pushing revolution farther and farther away. \n\nThe revolutionary creed is, after all, thus: \n\"The worst things get, the better.\"\n\nIt is no wonder why Argentina, after exhausting nearly all possible options, turned to a self professed anarchist.\n\nNow for DOGE and trump, they are far from Milei.\nLastly, top-down approaches will never work, you can not force people to be free, and enabling the state apparatus to accumulate such power will end up in the hands of our enemies. You see this time and time again through history,\n\nFrom the bolsheviks in russia to Attaturk in turkey, Singapore, South Korea, South Vietnam, etc etc...\n\nIt all ends in failure. This is why we are anarchists, because it is obvious the state and all its power is so corrupting.\n\n\nSo then you ask, what is the plan?\n\n1. The vanguard of the ideology (Anarcho-Capitalism), those being the most ideologically fanatic and educated and those with means, must adopt the idea of inevitablelism: the idea that it is natural, right, divine and unquestionably that our ideology will win. All of history leads to us. We must believe this, no matter how true or false this is. It is only a matter of course, after all.\n\n2. Proselytize: verb\nconvert or attempt to convert (someone) from one religion, belief, or opinion to another.\n\n- it is essential that we spread our propaganda, our message, and ideology through our connections and political parties and other means. Through education, can we start swaying a critical mass of people. \n\n3. Infiltration/creation\n\n- with the small (but larger than now hopefully) following of people, it is important that our people begin infaltrating and creating power structure and state/corporate infrastructure. \n\n- What this means is that buying controlling stakes in certain corporations that will help our cause, employing people and getting jobs and working your way up to positions of power to necessarily businesses, such as media, news, security, insurance etc.\n\n- As well as getting people in certain beaurocratic positions that hold some power or operate or direct certain industries, such as mail, police, military, etc. The lower ranks of these organizations and middle management will be important, especially those that actually hire people.\n\n4.  Division\n\n- Through our new founded connections, we begin dividing society based on class. \n\nA. To explain class, it is often thought by marxiat that there are 2 classes, and by liberals that there aren't really any classes. They are both wrong.\n\nNow, it is true that people can occupy multiple classes, but people will often identify with one or two. There are 6-8 classes depending on the society/country.\n\nThese classes are: Aristocracy (depends on the country) Manderins (Beaurocrats), bourgeois (capitalists), petite-bourgeois, proletariat (workers), peasants, military (sort of), and the clergy ( depends on the country).\n\n- it is important to build class consciousness in our friendly classes so we may propagandize and mobilize them to continue our ideological spread. \n\n- It is important to note that even friendly classes will continue to accept the current authority if times are good, which is why I had stated the the revolutionary credo is \"the worst things get, the better\"\n\nIt is only when times are bad that people are willing to follow revolutionary ideas. Revolution can only start in the most repressed classes when times are never good\n\n- The other reason to do this is to undermine the state and its authority, \n\n5. Separation\n\n - When a critical mass of people develop class consciousness and have been converted, can we now begin to undermine the state by separating markets and society. Think \"parallel\" economies, protests, moving away from the enemy and participation in black markets etc.\n\n\n6. Revolution\n\n- after everything is said and done, what you will find is a state so rotten and empty that no one will be willing to defend it. So that is when we can destroy it, secede, or capture it, but for our aims, just destroy or secede.\n\n\nFinal notes: This is revolution, and this is the ONLY option for us. We must learn from our predecessors and history that being allies with statist cannot happen because they will back stab always. (Russian and ukrainian anarchist, spanish anarchists, the 1960s lazzie fair Republicans, etc etc.) \n\nIt is imperative to understand that we aren't reactionaries nor reformists, we are revolutionary, because we are anarchists, the idea of a state is so antithetical to our beliefs is there is no way to square with it.\n\nLastly, from all revolutions, this is how it's done. Revolutions are often bloodless. It's only the aftermath that is bloody, when warlords, despots, and the like trying to take our liberty away is when war happens. \n\nAnarcho-Capitalism is inevitable and revolution is the only way.",

I do not want it to run smoothly and competently. Considering that everyone in the US unknowingly breaks 3 federal laws every day on average, you probably shouldn't either. BTW,  Rothbard didn't want an efficient government either. He wanted smart competent people to stay in the private sector where they would be of benefit to society, and for the government sector to be filled with lazy incompetent goofballs.\n\nMilei's modus operandi is to ween people off of government, causing as little harm and upset as possible, but his objective is to abolish the state as much as possible. No such thing can be said about DOGE or Trump. They want a lean mean governing machine.",

We will not, cannot, have the change we want in our own lifetimes, and promises from charismatic leaders of that change coming sooner are always, always, always false.

Milei can likely make his reforms stick within the context of Argentine political norms.\n\nOur problems do not originate from unilateral executive overreach, and we do have a strong tradition of separation of powers and rule of law, even where we feel the functioning of the systems of law are not leading to favorable outcomes.  \n\nTrump's current approach will hit severe resistance, and he won't have a leg to stand on when things start to get challenged in the courts.  \n\nThe backlash against the chaotic and reckless approach he's taking will likely lead to further entrenchment of the bureaucratic state -- and if he somehow *is* successful in his current approach, it will be a Pyrrhic victory, as the the erosion of constitutional norms and concentration of executive power needed to make his changes stick will set us up for unprecedented abuses of power when the pendulum swings back in the other direction.\n\nWe need a comprehensive program of government reform, involving the legislature, executive branch, and judiciary, not just haphazard media stunts by the president.",

Will that be enough? No. Will that get us an an-cap friendly government? Not by the standards here. \n\nMy friend I'm with you in spirit but settling for nothing short of a violent revolution and an anarchist utopia in the space that used to be a 330+ million person nation state seems... naive. \n\nYes we can all circle jerk to our ideals here, but it seems like you're ignoring that the overwhelming majority of people in this country don't want anything like what you/I want. \n\nI read your longer original comment elsewhere in the thread and I like it but you seem to be neglecting the fact that life here is far from awful enough for people to start wanting the system you think is the obvious choice. Like we are so wildly far from the nation advocating collectively for anarchy it would be funny if it weren't so sad and reflective of peoples incessant dependency on authority. Frankly idk how anyone lived through covid and didn't conclude there is a meaningful percent of the population who genuinely craves authority. Is some of that learned? Certainly. Is some of it baked into peoples DNA? Sure seems like it. I don't have that bone in my body but man did some people parade that hard. \n\nI've always said I love an-caps and root for them but have always found unchecked confidence in it to be a bit naive. I guess I'd call myself more of a filthy minarchist to you guys. Some very small and limited form of government to protect private property, contract law, negative human rights, court system, etc does not seem unreasonable to me. Hopefully I don't catch a ban for that. Counting entirely on the private sector to nail those things seems like a hope and a prayer even if I think it can do damn near 100% of things better than the state. \n\nEither way, the rally cry of an an-cap revolution is going to be a lonely one. You may be right that anything short of a revolution will wind us right back where we are, but I have trouble seeing the merit in trashing the stated purpose of DOGE as not even a little bit agreeable.

And you must love humanity as a whole. \n\n- people generally act, think, and do similar things in similar situations. Not entirely,  but enough and close enough.\n\n- people generally do not want to harm. They will if they feel a need to, but won't if they have other avenues in achieving their goals.\n\n- people can know only what they know. For over a millennia, people had believed that the earth was the center of the universe. Yet we know now that not to be true. It takes time and effort to change people's minds. \n\n- you must love humanity and believe in the human spirit to strive for better. You must have faith in their good will and common salt of the earth wisdom. If you do not believe that we as individuals can not change, learn, and be better, then why even advocate for any sort of power to the people? If the common man is just so reliant on their betters, perhaps we really should let our \"betters\" rule. After all, they know best, no? No.\n\n2. Why we should be praising state activities in our circles.\n\n- so to make a distinguishment, it is beneficial to partake in politics to a degree, but because we are human, it's easy to fall for our own lies.\n\n- The lie is that the doge and Milei are beneficial to our cause. It is not. Why? It proves to the common man that the state can be reformed, which it can not. So it only delays the inevitable, prologs the suffering, and discredits our ideology once the \"Libertarian\" state fails. \n\n3. Utopia\n\n- Utopia is a myth, and anarchism is not Utopian. People forget that the purpose of anarchism is to have a freer and morally coherent society, not a perfect one. Anarchism is a trade-off between security and liberty, that's it. I expect for many people, their lives won't change all to much, that's just how human society has always worked, yes it's clear how different a slaves life is to now, but from slavery to serfdom? Not much.\n\n4. Revolution and population. \n\n- Revolution does not take place when the majority wants something else. It is and has always been a minority dictating the fates of the majority. Most people just don't care.\n\n- it is not naive it is faith, to strive nothing short of Revolution. Not because I want it, but because it MUST happen. Revolution takes years of concerted effort and the right timing for things to take off. The only reason it seems nieve is because of the current situation and because it is in the states' best interest to demoralize us. \n\n- for the bolsheviks Revolution, it took 69 years for the communist manifesto to be published and the Revolution to succeed. And even long when communism and Socialism was first thought of. We are in our infancy. \n\nBut eventually, and inevitably, we will grow and prosper. \n\n(Uh tldr I lost my train of thought. I hate txting these ling rants, sorry \ud83d\ude1e couldn't respond to everything you said.)\n\nRegardless, my friend, keep the spirit alive and spread our message. That is how revolution always starts. With us.",
