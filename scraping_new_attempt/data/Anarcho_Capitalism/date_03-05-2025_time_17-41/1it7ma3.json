Your examples are inherently American first if they provide economic efficiency. Hiring foreign workers to work here is economic falsity, while buying the foreign made good is fine as it leads to more materials and monetary units in America's hands. Basically what leads to genuine markets is what is beneficial and American first. That may differ with someone else's American first, but if you are afraid of even the idea of American first don't expect Americans to be warm to your ideas. They might as well join the progressive cult.",

Challenge: impossible. \n\nAnd who is to say what does or doesn't put the \"American collective\" ahead of other collectives?\n\nThe (dumb) America First position is that we shouldn't let immigrants come to this country, because we need to put \"America First\" (meaning the people of our blood and born on our soil), but it could just as well be argued that letting in every immigrant who wants to come here is \"America First\" because 1) the people coming here want to *be American* so keeping them out is denying freedom to Americans, 2) keeping out immigrants weakens the American economy, and 3) forcing those immigrants to stay in their home countries or move to other countries strengthens those countries, our economic competition. \n\nNot to mention keeping them out requires a big, intrusive government which denies individuals their rightful freedom simply because they were born somewhere else. \n\nThe entire concept of \"America First\" is just politicians and demagogues tapping into small-minded collectivist resentment and grievance politics to justify bad policies that will make individual Americans poorer and less free.",

                    "body": "I agree with you. But I would only add the fact that politics (like economics) is a world of tradeoffs and compromises. This is why I don't want to run for office. If I run for office, then I hurt myself for criticizing the wrong people. But I just want to speak the truth. Ron Paul showed that a candidate *can* gain support from just telling the truth, but he also proved that established power will use any means necessary to prevent someone like that from holding office.  \n  \nSo I don't want to put myself in the business of figuring out which \"libertarians\" or \"America First\" candidates give lip service to American foreign policy dogmas because they have to (regardless of what they believe), and which ones are gullible enough to drink the kool-aid on those sacred cow issues. I also don't think there is much of a difference practically, either.  \n  \nPolitics is a game of incentives and persuasion. It is about rallying support from the necessary number of groups - and that includes voting blocks, special interests, disaffected groups, and established stakeholders alike. If you want to take power away from a group you dislike, then you have to have a plan for how to replace or dismantle them. And that might mean that you have to make alliances. Perhaps even uncomfortable ones.  \n  \nAgain. This is why I don't want to become a politician. I don't have the spirit to lie to people about what I believe, so rival groups wouldn't have much desire to work with me, and I wouldn't get very far.  \n  \nSo I'm just on the sidelines. All I care about is speaking the truth at every opportunity. I reject the delusion that a perfect candidate exists, or that good is necessarily the enemy of the perfect. I strive for perfect, but I'm not going to be surprised or pissed off when human nature runs its course.  \n  \nAs much as I despise the policies surrounding Israel, I have far more interest in ending the FED, ending the forever wars, and cutting the budget to save our society from a crash (if possible).  \n  \nIf a politician makes an alliance with Israel, I don't disagree with the fact that they saw the alliance as necessary. But I would disagree with the decision to continue the forever wars policy just to gain a short term goal of a minor domestic policy change.  \n  \nSo before I can criticize an alliance with the Israel lobby, I'd need to what what they are going to get out of that alliance. I can speculate about how that's going to go, but I don't know for sure.",
