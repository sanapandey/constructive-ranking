    "selftext": "\n\nJavier Milei\u2019s government (Argentina) presents itself as a champion of liberalism and free markets, yet in practice, it reveals itself as a populism disguised as \u201canarcho-capitalism.\u201d If we take libertarian principles seriously, his administration exposes a structural hypocrisy: he interferes in the economy in the most heavy-handed way through his presidential account while evading individual responsibility when it comes to his own mistakes.\n\nThe LIBRA case is the clearest example of this contradiction. Milei openly promoted this fraudulent investment scheme and, when it collapsed, simply washed his hands of it. However, he himself admitted that he did not conduct enough due diligence before endorsing it. From a genuine libertarian perspective, this is contractual negligence\u2014just as it would be under any legal system in the world. Anyone who understands blockchain can see that thousands of investors suffered financial losses due to LIBRA, though Milei\u2019s fanatics dismiss them as crazy, reckless gamblers, or casino players. Moreover, advances in blockchain analytics allow tracking the financial flows linked to its backing, providing concrete evidence of Milei\u2019s role in the scheme.\n\nWhat makes this even more serious is that Milei\u2019s tweet promoting LIBRA lacked the mandatory disclaimer that accompanies any financial product. This omission is not a mere oversight but a blatant disregard for industry standards and investor protection protocols, further eroding his credibility.\n\nIf this case were judged in an impartial court\u2014meaning, outside of Argentina, where Milei enjoys political protection\u2014it would be evident that his omission makes him civilly liable. As someone who influenced others\u2019 financial decisions, Milei has a moral and legal obligation to compensate those who were defrauded.\n\nRather than preaching about free markets and voluntary contracts while evading his own responsibilities, Milei should apply to himself the very principles he demands of others. Otherwise, his so-called \u201clibertarianism\u201d is nothing more than another form of economic populism disguised as ideological radicalism.\n\nThis double standard is reminiscent of Evo Morales in 2016, when he ignored the result of the February 21 referendum and sought to remain in power. Both cases reveal the same problem: leaders who demand rules for others but ignore them when they affect them personally.\n\nLibertarianism is based on honoring agreements and taking responsibility for one\u2019s own actions. If Milei truly believes in these principles, he cannot hide behind a victimhood narrative similar to the woke ideology he constantly rants against. His failure to take responsibility for the LIBRA victims proves that his rhetoric is merely a fa\u00e7ade, showing utter contempt for ethics and accountability.\n\n",

He specifically said that was impossible to achieve due to political realities ( having complete minory and no one would vote for it ) \n\nThere is actually one argument to be made about Milei's government being populist, the fact that he maintains Argentinian's direct Federal welfare, as a requirement from the IMF to obtain financing to rollback debt and to keep the macroeconomic disaster controlled while the economy transitions to a more competitive and free one with less taxes, but given how this \"critique\" started I'm pretty sure it won't even actually touch it.\n\n>  he interferes in the economy in the most heavy-handed way through his presidential account  \n\n1 Milei's twitter is not a Presidential account. 2 We have a public account in Twitter, and it's not Milei's. It's the one of the Casa Rosada. \n\nAlso giving opinions hardly it's called to interfere in the economy. This is completely fucking stupid. \n\n> Milei openly promoted\n\n1 Twit, for 4 hours before retracting himself. You call that openly ? Way to use inflammatory words. Why don't you go ahead and call it \"the biggest case of corruption in the history of Argentina\" like some Peronistas did ?\n\n> However, he himself admitted that he did not conduct enough due diligence before endorsing it. From a genuine libertarian perspective, this is contractual negligence\u2014\n\nThere is no contractual negligence when THERE IS NO FUCKING CONTRACT. \n\nMilei has recommended dozens of investments since he's President, including energy shares and bonds of the government, all those have given amazing numbers and made a lot of people have FOMO. And I mean actually recommend not just naming their general existence. Were those scams too ?\n\n>Anyone who understands blockchain can see that thousands of investors suffered financial losses due to LIBRA\n\nNo, anyone who understands blockchain realizes that anyone who invested in a meme coin cuz someone mentioned it are complete fucking idiots. \nAlso thousands of investors ? Lmfao. There are like 4 guys in the USA filing a lawsuit.\n\n>though Milei\u2019s fanatics dismiss them as crazy, reckless gamblers, or casino players\n\nGee I wonder why.\n\n>Moreover, advances in blockchain analytics allow tracking the financial flows linked to its backing, providing concrete evidence of Milei\u2019s role in the scheme.\n\nWow amazing, you have \"evidence\" before any investigation was made !. \n\n>What makes this even more serious is that Milei\u2019s tweet promoting LIBRA lacked the mandatory disclaimer that accompanies any financial product.\n\nDid you snorted drugs while writting this or something ? \n\n>If this case were judged in an impartial court\u2014meaning, outside of Argentina, where Milei enjoys political protection\u2014it would be evident that his omission makes him civilly liable. \n\nThe Justice system has been in control of the Peronistas since Menem, and currently of the PRO, political allies but by no means in life allies of Milei. And he's currently having a lawsuit outside of the country.\n\n>Milei has a moral and legal obligation to compensate those who were defrauded.\n\nIf I tell some idiot \"Hey I think investing in this is a good idea\" because I did so and got me some money in the past, they do it, and loose all their money, cus just at the time the investment was going down, I'm legally obligated to compensate their stupidity ? Lmao. \n\n>Libertarianism is based on honoring agreements and taking responsibility for one\u2019s own actions\n\nSo let the morons who invested in a memecoin take responsability then. \n\n\nAlso I find it funny how your troll account basically got obliterated in Merval ( Argentinian forum for investing ), and even got comments removed by the mods. Promoting bad faith shit much ?",
