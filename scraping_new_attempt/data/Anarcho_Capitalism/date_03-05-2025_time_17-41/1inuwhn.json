This *can* happen again - - but it's going to take a real cultural shift in terms of how we as a society think about and value science.\n\nThis is some of the context in the background of many of these science funding fights that happen.

Weight loss meds, statins (which are now questioned if they help at all). It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to grab onto something to win some argument here. The whole system is set up to keep people sick while half, if not more of the research is sponsored by the US. You can get broad spectrum antibiotics in any non-western country for a few bucks max, and the dosage is smaller vs what you get prescribed in the US, so your guts don\u2019t get fucked up after the second day of use. People in those countries are educated on harms of antibiotics and they don\u2019t over use it, while we\u2019re here in a free country are not allowed to make decisions on our own cause the government thinks we\u2019re too dumb. \n\n\u201cAnd it's reasonable to expect that further biomedical advances could extend human life even more.\u201d\n\nThat would be amazing, but there\u2019s no reason to have a corrupt scheme for funding, as any new groundbreaking drugs have astronomical prices for several years, and very often are not covered by insurance.
