With that state being hard core dem, it will get ugly due to lack of cooperation and it will look ugly for Trump too.  Maybe the IRS could guestimate taxes of each individual?  They may not do a good job. Maybe banks could be forced to seize bank accounts?  But even a small bank run by dems could easily destabilize the banking system, Canada saw the same when they tried to attack antilockdown protesters.   The IRS harassing one org or a few individuals somewhat quietly is a whole diff thing from trying to harrass an entire state.  \n\nAnyway Maine is dinky and I doubt it has much of its own resources.  The ultimate punishment for Maine may be for Trump to let Maine leave. Maine will have to cut deals either with the fed or Canada or some other country for power, water, food, etc.  Plus they probably lack some crucial infrastructure for independence that they'll have to build.  And who knows if regular Maine voters want to go that far over such a smaller issue, maybe they'll recall their governor instead.  Lately it seems that politicians are more extreme than most of their voters.  \n\nMy bet is she'll decide to back down and/or get pressured into backing down. But if she doesn't, it will be interesting to watch how it plays out.",

Only 20% of people support trans women in women's sports anyway, and I doubt a significant portion of them would be willing to go to jail or deliberately evade taxes. From there you just pick the biggest companies and wealthy people there who aren't paying and go after them. Then you could pick random people from the rest of the group.\n\nNot that this type of governmental warfare is a good idea.",

Anyone with two eyes can see that it's unfair and a joke and screws up a whole sport, since the trans woman, if they were even a halfway decent male athlete, wins the whole women's tournament or event easily and messes up the record books...in addition to being a health risk in some cases. To support it you have to have no social awareness, no logical thinking, AND paying no attention. It's like the litmus test of whether someone is a woke nut.

Johnson is often associated with the first brick, but she never took credit for it. \nSylvia Rivera\nA Latina trans woman who was a leader in the gay liberation movement. Rivera never took credit for throwing the brick. \n\"Flame queens\", hustlers, and gay \"street kids\"\nThese were the most marginalized people in the gay community at the time. They were responsible for the first volley of projectiles. \n\nWithout the inclusion of the T there is no LG or B rights the stonewall inn movement which lead to civil rights for the LGBTQ community being led and started by a black trans woman. This is a systematic attack on The Civil Rights Act of 1964's Title VII protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Bostock v. Clayton County that Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination applies to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nTo think that this wouldn't hold up as discrimination in court based on the same SCOTUS's previous declaration on the matter is absurd. Quite frankly dictating what someone else can and can not do is authoritarian by nature regardless of the circumstances. Laws should require an injured party as is the basis for the N.A.P. this rounds back to picking the \"weakest link,\" but if the least of these can be dehumanized, the rest can be as well.",

Are segregated bathrooms even legal? Are segregated sports even legal in the first place?\n\nThe answer may surprise you- not really according to the civil rights act. But nobody's challenged it.\n\nIn fact we've heard a lot of people challenging the opposite- can you restrict TRANS from the biologically wrong bathroom? And you see bills popping up from state to state. ALL OF THEM ARE ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION.\n\nThe question is, is it already legal for a man to go in a woman's room? According to the civil rights act of 64, yes. Already legal. If an establishment barrs you from doing so, *they've violated your civil rights!*\n\nI once talked to a civil rights lawyer about this. Since race and sex are both protected under the civil rights act, and separate-but-equal has been ruled unconstitutional as of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), we already know we can't have white and black only classes or water fountains. Of course the topic of bathrooms came up. I asked, can you segregate bathrooms on race?\n\nAccording to Turner v. City of Memphis (1962), the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in publicly owned restaurants (which included restrooms) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nShe said, no, if you segregate bathrooms based on race it's a pretty open and shut case.\n\nI said, isn't sex listed right next to race in the very same act that the racial segregation rulings are based on?\n\nShe had a bewildered look on her face and said \"well i guess nobody's challenged that yet. I would think it would likely reach SCOTUS.\"\n\nOne might wonder if they'll use tradition to back-door sexual segregation but they've painted themselves well into a corner on the issue.\n\nAnyway, that's my data dump on an issue I was tangentially interested in once upon a time.",

If the state makes laws forcing female teams to allow males, that impinges on individual rights. The constitution and the fed have a duty to enforce laws PROTECTING individual rights.  But if they use their same power to IMPINGE on individual rights either at state or individual level, that is when we cry foul.\n\nIn this case, I personally feel that forcing teams to accept any claim of gender identity while blocking them from asking for any medical records or verification is a clear path for any male to just decide to be on the female's team, even if there has been no hormone treatments or trans alterations, Maine's rules on this have been more extreme than most states and IMO they violate women's rights to fair and safe sports participation and should be struck down.  Also polling in Maine shows that people living in Maine overall do not support her policy on this either so she is forcing this onto her own people as well.\n\nBeyond all that, i'm not fully confident that Trump can be trusted to not impinge on individual rights at some point but I will still support any protections of individual rights that he does do.  In this case, IMO what Trump is doing is the lesser of two evils. The fed has a responsiblity to protect individual rights in Maine from a nut politician forcing her weird bs on the people of Maine.",

If you assumed they'd vote along those lines, that would actually be 72% in favor of ending slavery. Let alone if you included the slaves in the poll, who I assume would be *heavily* in favor of ending it. If slaves were 10% of the population (I don't know the exact number then) that puts you over 80% in favor of ending slavery.\n\nIf you assume everyone was polled on women's suffrage (including women obviously), you could assume that  roughly 100% of women would be in favor of it, and at least 50% of men were in favor of it (suffrage first failed in the Senate in 1918 apparently because it got 63% of the senators vote and needed 66%), you have 75% of the population being in favor of women's suffrage.\n\nNow at a certain point in the past I'm sure bigotry was higher, but over time the support for these things increased. Support for trans women in women's sports has decreased over time as people have seen how unfair it is. [The number of people supporting it dropped from 2021 to 2023 and dropped even further from 2023 to now.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx)\n\nNow having said this, people's rights are not a matter of what's popular or not popular. We have to debate whether trans people are a category that should get rights in that way separately. I'm just talking about who does or doesn't support it in terms of how it would effect the governor's career to be coming down on one side in this way, since Trump said she would be out of politics after this.",

It certainly would be a twist if Maine was the first state to try to secede and of all things to fight so hard for, she chose letting men play in women's sports?  The world gets weirder every day.  \n\nAnd IMO if one state tries this and gets away with it in any way, other states will consider it next time they get super peeved.  And in some states, counties may also then try it,  I can totally see some California counties trying to split off from California, there are some very red counties to the east that can't stand what the dems are doing and there's a similar situation in Oregon. What if those areas just refused to give over income of their people until they were allowed to go free?  I bet Trump would back the republican areas of Oregon and California getting freedom and if those areas became separate states, it could mean more republican electoral votes and fewer dem electoral votes.",
