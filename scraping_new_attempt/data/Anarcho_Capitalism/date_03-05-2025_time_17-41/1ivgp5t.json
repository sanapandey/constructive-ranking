I don\u2019t think people that buy a new iPhone every year and sit with their MacBook in Starbucks, have any moral right to complain about the system. So in the end, yeah, they complain about the system and the rich people that run it, buy they are the ones that enable this behavior by voluntarily pumping their money into the system.
