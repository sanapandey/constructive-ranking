The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\u00a0does not require Senate confirmation. This position is not a Senate-confirmed role, unlike the NIH Director which is a PAS role.   Instead Fauci was just appointed by the director of NIH.  \n\nA CIA report done under Biden said covid was likely of lab leak origin, that lab was funded illegally by Fauci.  The CIA report was done under Biden but Biden suppressed it.

The money was so unaccountable that USAID refused to cooperate with the US Afghan War watchdog.  \n\nIronically USAID also sent millions to the Eco Health alliance that funded the Wuhan lab.  USAID also gave 6 million to Egypt to support tourism, there's a long list of weird stuff like that.  How about 47k for a transgender opera in Colombia?  $70K for a DEI musical in Ireland? And 446K to support expansion of atheism in Nepal.  People are just start to dig through the lists so I'm sure we'll find a lot more.  \n\nA lot of this money is not even going to needy people, it's just weird fluff projects and grift.",

Usaid isn't just throwing money and supplies to the taliban.\n\nEco health was never proven to have started the pandemic and the funding to them was for virus prevention in Asia.

Our own people are literally starving on the street right now and it is criminal and immoral that we don't take care of that first.  \n\nAs for the Wuhan thing, I mean they were literally creating covid viruses in a lab right next to where a covid virus first infected the public.  The lab had a very bad safety record and the virus that was found in the community had alterations that did not look natural.  Obama banned gain of function research becuase it's super dangerous so Fauci funded gain of function research in China instead to circumvent the law and then when Fauci was asked in congress if he ever funded gain of function research, he lied and said no, then later we found the paper trail that showed he did.  So he lied about that and when researchers came to him early in the pandemic worried that evidence showed the virus was manmade, he paid them large sums of money and they changed their stories.  All just coincidence and not proof enough for you?  OK bro, you do you then.  \n\nAlso you kept claiming fauci was approved by the senate and you turned out to be wrong, sorry but someone else being confirmed by the senate does not in any way equate.

Elon musk was put in a department with no real power other than an advisory role and then given unhinged access to payroll when congress didn't get a chance to vet him as a director. Donald Trump is not a director and he has to nominate directors. Because faucis director was vetted by the president and congress faucis appointment was by extension vetted. You technically didn't vote for any director but you shouldn't get to because you are unequiped to understand the nuances of that. Anthony Fauci helped develop a safe and effective vaccine for a deadly virus that so far has not been proven to have come from a Wuhan lab. He is a medical hero.",

Coercion is the opposite kind of power than soft power.  \n\nAs for Medicaid, Trump never shut that down or touched it directly nor intended to from anything I can see, if you have evidence to the contrary, you'll need to present it.  \n\nTrump shut down USAID and announced a funding and grant freeze. The Medicaid payment portal services a range of money dispersal programs beyond just Medicaid and was briefly offline.  Directors said it was offline so they could review and scrub access to any funding that was banned under the Trump directive and that it would be online again for regular Medicaid payments again shortly, this was before any action by a judge. \n\nMedicaid payments were never targeted and the main announcements from the start were that regular programs like social security, SNAP, etc would not be touched, this was before any judge intervened.  I mean think it through, tons and tons of Republicans are on medicaid too.   There are a lot of rumors flying right now and a lot of them are false or huge exaggerations so you may be expected to provide decent evidence from less biased sources at times if I can't find it myself and in the case of Medicaid, I'm not finding any actual facts to support it .",

It isn't clear yet who is going to be forced to end their dei programs but a lot of hospitals that get paid by Medicaid operate those programs and trump said he's going to try to get the private sector to end dei. He may start to define hospitals as governments contractors and change their agreements with the federal government thereby changing Medicaid for thar hospital.

Conservatives love to say DEI is just hiring colored people but its not. \n\nAs for defending presidents actions individually fine but cutting federal funding to research programs foreign aid and beyond is not a good policy. Even if it was you are defending a post that supports an unelected official doing the cutting. Do you support a billionaire telling trump what to cut and what to keep? So fine lets say you dont support everything he does. As a candidate do you support donald trump and further do you then accept the consequences of all the things he does? Because you cant accept one small vein of what trump does and ignore everything else. If you do support donald and you also support his main policies and beliefs then fine you win. Or Ill even say this, if you dont care about everything else he does and this is important enough to you that you support him over this issue then perfect you win. But you do have to take a stance on the other things he does of either you agree disagree or you are indifferent you cant just pretend they dont exist.

So don't bother trying to claim otherwise. I may not always happen but it for sure does happen.  I have a lot of friends in machining and it's a huge problem there because for whatever social reason, very close to zero POC go into that field, plus it takes a long time to learn so you can't just take a crash course and get up to speed.  But still they have the DEI quotas that must be met so people get hired that don't even know how to turn on a machine and they are given adminstrative roles since they can't perform any actual labor, they are basically useless in that job and sponging off the DEI system.\n\nSCOTUS has started to make some rulings against DEI as well as it's illegal to play favorites based on race which is exactly what DEI does. The fairest solution IMO is play favorites based on economic status, then you help everyone that needs it and if there are more POC that are poor then more POC will get helped.   Also wealthy POC won't be getting the jobs meant to help the poor.  Obamas kids don't need DEI help, aid should be targeted to those that need it, not via skin color.\n\nThere's plenty of other races that got enslaved in the USA like CHinese and Irish, where is their special programs? What about all those Japanese that were put in internment camps and all their property stolen but the US govt? Many of them got jobs in landscaping because regular jobs were too prejudiced to hire them.  Why are they not getting special job aid now?   Oh because they don't need it right?  OK so base the help on need, not skin type.",

Perhaps there are situations where DEI is not carried out correctly, but it is a vast system that operates through many different programs and people like donald trump and elon musk want to start wiping DEI in broadstrokes. Im all for DEI reform to solve problems in the system, however DEI does some really great stuff and I think its silly to say that just because of these small instances in you and your friends life that it is a bad system all around. I do not think that you would also support getting rid of socially beneficial programs that come out of DEI and I understand how personal anecdotes are more impactful on our minds than more statistical evidence that we can't connect with. All I ask is that you approach the topic with an open mind.\n\n2. As for the second paragraph DEI is not racist because its a fix for racism. In places like universities and certain fields especially ones requiring higher education it is very difficult for POC to get into those fields because of how their community has been treated. Im not just talking about mean words I am talking about how these communities are policed how drugs were introduced into their communities, how they have had very little funding to help support social programs. Because they dont have the same social programs and the same safety in their community everything else is harder to do. Thats why DEI exists, so we can create those social programs and bring in more people to these systems that represent that community. It is important for all these communities to be represented in these fields for numerous reasons. It is good for other people in that community to see their own people thriving in a field, it makes them more comfortable going to the doctor or the lawyer because they understand the same cultural norms that affect them. Imagine if you lived in a world where you grew up in a community surrounded by a bunch of people that looked like you and acted like you, but every encounter with power you had was with people that looked and acted completely different to you, you would probably be quite uncomfortable, maybe youd feel like the people who were making decisions didnt understand your problems. It is no different then people from different areas of the country. People in LA live much different lives than someone in mid state idaho or nebraska. Thats why we create means for them to gain more power in governance than they would otherwise. Groups differentiate people, they dont have to divide us but they do impact our lives and we should take that into consideration when we create policy.\n\n3. DEI is not necessarily about past enslavement or atrocities in the past. It is about what is happening now that may have been caused by the events in the past. The Irish communities in New England do not have as deep of struggles as POC largely do. If there was evidence to suggest that group was being marginalized I would absolutely support DEI for them. As for the Japanese people yeah lets create DEI programs for them. Im sure states like california that were heavily involved in the internment of them probably have something like that. And yes we should be giving help out based on need but DEI programs are also important because they also address racist societal issues that are directed to certain groups. I truly need you to know that DEI is not just handing out money or just giving people free jobs. Its about creating new systems that give marginalized groups access to social areas they havnt been able to before because the systems were keeping them out. Whether that be education, healthcare, governance etc. \n\nId also like to add on that I think its quite blatent that using the term DEI has become a pseudo slur for colored people. Thats why I think it is extra important to understand what DEI actually is about and what it does. We cant resort to just using DEI as a word for \"Giving POC free jobs\", that is a dangerous thing to do considering the way people now use the term DEI.",

And again, if you want to help poor people, then provide help based on income.  There is literally no reason to not just use income as the marker, well to do POC do not need aid more than poor whites.  Aid should be given only to those who need it.    \n\nFor number 3, if you want to provide help based on what is happening now, then don't base it on skin color, base it on income.

Heres one article [Who Benefits From Diversity And Inclusion Efforts?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelleking/2023/05/16/who-benefits-from-diversity-and-inclusion-efforts/) I also linked an article about how DEI helps POC access healthcare more easily above that you can go find on your own. As well DEI is not prejudiced because white people already dominate these fields and we already have access to the systems to get into those fields and do well in them. The article above talks about that. Specifically in the corporate world. You dont like prejudice yet you support taking away systems that help break systemic racism in the work force, sounds pretty racist to me. What you are failing to see is that it isnt just about income, that is apart of it but because of the history skin color has been associated with that and DEI helps break that down by creating normality of representation for those groups.\n\n2. I explained above how DEI is not racism. \n\n3. Obamas kids are not getting DEI if anything they are getting hand outs based on who their dad is. You are just appealing to one coloured person who is very famous to try and make your point. Income can be apart of DEI I agree, its true the DEI system does need to be fixed in some places, but you are ignoring the blatently racist barriers that prevent minority groups from doing well in certain fields. \n\n[Racism and discrimination in health care: Providers and patients - Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racism-discrimination-health-care-providers-patients-2017011611015)\n\n[Black Physicians\u2019 Experiences with Anti-Black Racism in Healthcare Systems Explored Through An Attraction-Selection-Attrition Lens - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9184355/)\n\n[Black Americans expect to face racism in the doctor's office, survey finds : Shots - Health News : NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/12/05/1217148407/black-americans-racism-health-care)\n\nHere I have linked three articles from three reputable sources (Harvard, National Institute of Health, and NPR) which outline how racism operates, often unconsciously, through the healthcare system. DEI in the healthcare system whether that be in the education portion, the hiring portion or general equitable conduct policy supports POC in that field.

These are sermons on opinions and world views currently popular, but writing an opinion piece is not research, it's still an opinion piece.\n\nAlso you have done absolutely nothing to debunk my argument that simply targeting aid based on income is the obvious and totally not racist way to help people of low income.  Do some people sometimes have to confront prejudice in the world due to skin color?  Of course. And also people have to deal with prejudice due to their gender, attractiveness, weight, religion, accent, educational background, etc.  Are we going to try to fix all that with special programs too?  Or is it just skin color only for some reason?\n\nEveryone's got problems bro, it's not just POC and if you have a decent job and are doing OK, count yourself lucky.  If you don't and you are poor, those are the ones that actually really need help, regardless of skin color.  You literally have no argument against this better plan that everyone will agree is not racist and that will also help a lot of POC but only those who really need it, so you keep ignoring it.",

I bet a pretty black person does not suffer more than an ugly white person when it comes to prejudice but we'll never know for sure because people don't care about truth, they just want to push their own world view according to their feelings.  DEI is trendy now but it's just that a trend that is based in feelings and not facts.   \n\nAnd I can say rich POC get jobs for being POC because I've seen it.  Businesses have quotas, quotes are a basic tenet of DEI.  Businesses get a lot of pressure to have a certain percentage of POC and they will hire accordingly but they don't GAF if the POC is rich or not.  They can then say hey look, we have X number of POC employed, we are a good company.  But it gets hard for industries that POC don't favor or if not many POC live in the area, so standards get pretty low on which POC they will hire.  You don't have to believe me if you don't want to but since i've seen it, you can't convince me otherwise, this does happen.  Maybe that does not fit the preferred narrative but it's a logical outcome of quotas and it happens.  And in some areas like machining, it's dangerous due to the importance of quality in their products to have clueless uneducated people there just due to skin color.  \n\nIs it racist to say someone only got a job due to being black even if it's totally true they only got a job due to being black and would not have ever gotten that job which they were totally unqualified for otherwise?  \n\nAlso you totally ignored ALL my arguments about income based aid and my argument is that IT IS BETTER and should be used INSTEAD, which is something you are still ignoring. I never said you didn't support it at all, I said you were ignoring it (and you were) and that you have no argument against my claim that it is better (and you still haven't given any argument to that effect) \n\nWhy not have both?  Because income based aid solves every problem that DEI claims to solve while having none of the downsides that people accuse DEI of and income based aid helps only those who need it and will not be called racist by others. There is no reason to have DEI if you have income based aid instead and having DEI would be a waste of money and effort and be taking away funding from a superior program that would do a better job, that's why.",

You have provided no evidence to suggest that income based aid solves the racial issues brought up in those peer reviewed studies. So I provided articles telling you how racism affects getting into the medical field and how it affects accessing healthcare which did have something to do with income but it wasnt all income.

You would be asking income based aid to solve something that DEI can't do either.  Even countries where there is no racial diversity suffer from heavy prejudice and it will be done along location of birth, family name, etc.  It's endemic to humans.  That's why trying to push reverse racism to fix racism is so ironic, you are pushing racism in the name of equality, and that can't work.  You can't fix racism by pushing the judging of people on skin color and giving favored treatment to people of only certain skin colors.  And doing that will never make things equal, it will just make them unequal in different ways as more qualified people are passed over for jobs because the did not have the preferred skin color.  \n\nThat's why you see people like Kamala saying she's Indian when Indian was a more favored race and then suddenly saying she's black when being black was more favored, she's just milking an unfair system.  Same reason ELizabeth Warren lied about being Cherokee, she saw an advantage to being a minority race and she would not be lying about if she didn't think it would help her to actually not be white.   It goes to show that being white is not a great aid in recent years, so much so that people lie to get the advantages to not being white, which means DEI has NOT made things equal, they've just made things unequal in different ways.  (and made a lot of people into liars)  \n\nAlso your 'research' was opinions, opinions are not facts.  If the narrative they are told is everyone is racist against you and then you ask them if people are racist against, you, obviously they will say yes, because you pushed that narrative. \n\nRecently a homeless person was trying to set up an incampment in the customer waiting section of a burger shop and he got kicked out and he loudly had to shout his opinion that he was getting kicked out due to racism, and not more obvious reasons like he had not bathed in a year, was a crack head, had a shopping cart full of garbage with him, and was not a paying customer.  As if they'd have let a similar white person do it, which obviously they would not.  Nope in his mind, it was all racism because that's the narrative.  Opinions are not data, they are just repeating the narrative they were told.  If you ask that homeless man how many times he got kicked out of a store due to being black, he'll tell you it happens lots of times, but that does not make his opinion into fact.  He didn't get kicked out because he was black.  Feelings and opinions are not facts or proof of anything. \n\nNow there may be better evidence, i'm not saying there is not but I do find your lack of it as interesting so far.",

Somebody went to the doctors and he didn't believe her on something, that's not proof of racism, many white people are not believed by their white doctors.   A link to an opinion means nothing to me.  And as I've also said, I saw things with my own eyes so I don't need links to know those things are true. You don't have to believe me but I believe me as I was there and that's good enough for me.  I think you also know that each thing I have said probably does  happen sometimes though but you just prefer to deny it.   You need a link to believe that people play the race card at times when it's not valid?  You need a link to know that DEI pushes quotas on companies?  Are you being honest with yourself?  I also never said that all DEI candidates are significantly under prepared, I said some of them are.  I don't think companies are going to make it easy by admitting they are hiring shxt employees though.   But many companies are starting to move away from DEI so maybe they realize the problem.  \n\nAnyway, I think it's obvious you are unwilling to admit DEI has even a single flaw so there's no point to further conversation.  The irony is I used to be for affirmative action for situations when there were many qualified candidates like for college admissions, I thought it was reasonable to give the underprivileged a little bit of a boost.  But it's gone way too far now, we are told math is racist, calling out obvious fallacies is racist and disagreeing with anything is racist and it's just become reverse racism and cancel culture now.   You took it too far and you lost the plot. \n\nBut no matter, think as you please, but people are seeing through it now and it's falling out of favor and we'll move on to the next belief system 'true' narrative that probably also will be both heavily spun and over simplified.  Because that's how humans roll.  All of them, regardless of skin color.  ;-P  (and bye bye and live long and prosper, I'm blocking you. )",
