Maybe a few gold and silver enthusiasts follow next, way down the chain, and then, way way way lower, a few altcoin groups promoting their coins as bitcoin alternatives. \n\nIf you want to argue that your cute little reddit community + a few hundred small businesses around the world are using your crypto as currency too, I'd suggest that even if you have a million businesses taking it, your total scope is still a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of a percentage of bitcoin's usage and doesn't show up on anyone's radar.\n\nRemember I once shared a link with you here about a [Federation Bitcoin Circular Economies](https://fbce.io/btc-circular-economies-1)? Some of those have grown huge. Lots of small towns in Peru are using nothing but bitcoin now. South africa has an area (Ekasi) using bitcoin with thousands of people daily. El Salvador is still in the running with cities like Berlin, which has over 200 Businesses all using bitcoin exclusively. No saving in dollars! \n\nSome of these cities are now regularly holding bitcoin conferences, because they've grown so much in the last year or two... You're just far behind the times with that argument now, and it's starting to look like you're willfully ignorant.",
