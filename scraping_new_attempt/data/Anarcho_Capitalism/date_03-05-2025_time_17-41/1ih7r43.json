Arrangements will have been made with other countries, similar to what's being handled with the prison setup but less so because the punishment is social isolation.  Voting rights would be revoked for the duration of the exile, and they can try to live an otherwise productive life in the new country.\n\nIf they offend in the new country the process will repeat and generally the consequence will be to move to poorer and poorer society reducing their quality of life but also allowing them to be relatively more productive in each new society making rehabilitation more likely.  Eventually if they are still a problem they do get executed but that means almost no nation will take you.",

One reduce the number of offenses on the books that warrant prison time, and two, liberalize self-defense laws.\n\nIn a more theoretical vein I like Bob Murphy's ideas, where known criminals are pushed into slums by the population via strong self-defensive measures and refusal to associate with them socially and economically. With that system I imagine slums like Dante's rings of hell, where the worse one's crimes are or the more unrepentant one is the further into the slums they are pushed, and the longer it takes to get out. Getting out involves earning back the trust of the population, which would be a slow process. The two main benefits are that it is not just one corruptible person who decides the fate of the accused but it is instead a sort of mutual agreement at the individual level between the accused and the rest of society, and it is self-organizing which means that it responds more quickly to changing societal circumstances, just like any market. There are also no violations of the NAP in that system.\n\nThe downsides to a system like that are that the society has to be informed about the facts of the case and they have to be vigilant about their own self-defense. I've seen many instances of local newspapers alerting people to the release of violent criminals back into their society, and with a system of reputable arbitrators and reporters informing the population about the facts of a case and it's disposition, I think being adequately informed is not a problem. People are also pretty good at picking out rumor mongers and frauds, so I doubt false accusations would be very sustainable. Self-defense is a presumption in a theoretical stateless society, including with the aid of security companies, so I don't think that is insurmountable either. Security companies would be the best informed since they have an incentive to protect their clients and an easier job if criminals are pushed out of their territory, so they would be a good source of info.",
