That keeps the government on its toes, always looking for the best way forward. The same goes for any country leaders only really get moving when they feel the heat. But here\u2019s the problem with statism: leaders who don\u2019t feel the pressure get lazy. In resource-rich countries, they don\u2019t see the warning signs, so corruption creeps in, nothing gets done, and the whole system starts circling the drain-classic socialism downfall. Singapore doesn\u2019t have that luxury. If its leaders screw up, the consequences hit fast and hard, so they have to stay on top of their game.",
