    "selftext": "The key in eliminating poverty is simple. \n\nMax out correlation between income and wealth to parenthood. From 0.3 to 0.9\n\nThen count financial support as income. For example, if a woman pick a rich man as husband or as sugar daddy, don't count her as no income woman and conclude that women's children correlate negatively with \"income\".\n\nThat's extremely misleading. \n\nAnyway chat GPT says:\n\nThe correlation between income and parenthood differs for men and women:\n\n1. Correlation Between Income and Fatherhood\n\nPositive correlation: Higher-income men are more likely to have children.\n\nChildlessness is more common among low-income men.\n\nMen with stable careers and higher earnings tend to marry and have children at higher rates.\n\nEstimated correlation: Studies suggest a moderate positive correlation (~0.2 to 0.4) between income and the likelihood of fatherhood.\n\n---\n\n2. Correlation Between Income and Motherhood\n\nNegative correlation: Higher-income women are less likely to have children or tend to have fewer.\n\nCareer trade-offs: Women with high earnings often delay or limit childbirth due to career demands.\n\nEducation and fertility: Since education (which delays childbirth) is linked to income, this further reduces fertility rates.\n\nEstimated correlation: A moderate negative correlation (~-0.2 to -0.4) between income and number of children among women.\n\n---\n\n3. Overall Correlation of Parenthood and Income (Both Genders)\n\nIn general, men with higher income have more kids, while women with higher income have fewer.\n\nIf looking at the population as a whole (men + women combined), the correlation between income and parenthood is likely weak or close to zero, since the two effects cancel each other out.\n\nWould you like more specific numbers from research studies?",

No matter how much commie bullshit you pile on top of society, there will always be those who have more than others. \n\nPoverty is also relative. Poverty in 2025 is living in a dump living paycheck to paycheck. But you have a degree of food security. Impoverished people even have access to technology and knowledge. 250 years ago, the poor could not afford to access knowledge and knowledge is the biggest determining factor in improving your circumstances. There has never been a better time to be poor than now. \n\nI imagine the standard for poverty would be an even higher in Ancapistan due to society in general being prosperous.",
