    "selftext": "I think Russia should be allowed to control disputed territories if they invest. \n\nThey should compete with other investors though. Americans, Chinese, Europeans, Arabs. Let people decide who the investors should be democratically once things calm down. \n\nThere are plenty of countries that want extra territories. China, USA, Israel, etc. \n\nSimilar solutions can be used in all other conflict regions. \n\nPalestine, Africa, Sudan, nigeria. \n\nHold a truce. \n\nDivide conflict areas into 20 regions. \n\nFind investors that \"colonize\" The area in exchange for shares with people living there. \n\nThe area are then run for profit. \n\nPeace and prosperity for everyone. \n\n1000 Prosperas. \n\nOh ya. People can shop around and move to nearby regions they like. Want capitalism go to capitalist regions. Want Shariah go to Shariah regions. Want wokism? Go to woke region. All those areas are nearby living side by side peacefully. Close but not too close for problems in one area spill to another. \n\nLet money talk first. When it fails we can go back to guns but why not give money a fair chance?\n\nIs this stable? Well the small regions won't attack the big ones. There goes excuses against big regions attacking the small regions. \n\nAlso if a region is controlled by UAE or USA, for example. Attack toward that region will demolish good relationship with UAE and USA. Not profitable. \n\nIf UAE govern a part of Gaza would Israel attack that region and losing their good relationship with UAE, one of the view Arab countries Israel befriend with? No. Will UAE launch October 7th? You kidding me. That's not their reputation.\n\nhttps://disruptive-horizons.com/p/is-dubai-better-than-prospera?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web",

This is a bad example precisely because Israel could give negative fucks what UAE thinks of them. The only country aligned with them is the US. They know that, and they're fine with it.\n\nSame basically applies with Russia. Everyone already hates them. They hated Russia almost as much before all this started, so reputation loss was basically 0 deterrent.",
