    "selftext": "Luigi Mangione pressed his back against a cold alley wall.  \nHis breath \u2014 short, sharp bursts.  \nThe air reeked of burning plastic, the city choking on its own rot.\n\nOverhead, a drone hovered, sweeping the streets with infrared scanners.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Enforcers had every corner of this city under their boot.\n\nFacial recognition. Neural ID trackers. AI-powered predictive policing.  \nEvery system designed to erase men like him before they ever got this far.\n\nBut tonight?\n\nAnother billionaire was going to die.\n\nLuigi checked his pulse pistol \u2014 one charge left.  \nEnough.  \nHe didn\u2019t need firepower. He needed precision.\n\nAcross the street, a penthouse loomed above the slums like a golden temple of the untouchable.  \nThat\u2019s what The Board thought.  \nThat\u2019s what they all believed.\n\nThat wealth was power.  \nThat the system would keep them safe.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nA name burned in Luigi\u2019s mind.  \nThe next target\u2026\n\n**Elon Musk.**\n\nFirst, Musk bought Twitter.  \nThen, he bought the presidency.  \nNot with votes. With money.  \nLike he was picking up another superyacht.\n\nAnd once he had the throne?\n\nHe burned democracy to the ground.  \nHe lined his pockets.  \nHe played emperor while the people \u2014\n\nHelpless.  \nPowerless.  \nHopeless.\n\nOr so they thought.\n\nThey say, \u201cDon\u2019t hate the player. Hate the game.\u201d  \nBut what if the game was rigged from the start?  \nWhat if one man could buy a nation\u2019s future?  \nWhat if billionaires decided who lived and who died?\n\nA strong argument for the guillotine.\n\nNobody should be rich enough to buy the presidency.  \nTo Trojan Horse their way into absolute power.  \nTo put their greed over an entire nation.\n\nAnd this motherfucker wasn\u2019t even American.\n\n**SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?**\n\nIt took years for the torches to come out.  \nFor people to remember how to build a guillotine.\n\n**Elon Musk**  \nNet worth: $1.9 trillion.  \nOfficial title: Chairman of The Board.  \nUnofficial title: The Man Who Killed America.\n\nMangione had studied Musk\u2019s financials like a hit list.  \nHe knew where the money came from.  \nWhere it was buried.  \nWhere Musk spent his nights.\n\nAnd tonight?\n\nMusk was home.  \nSurrounded by a dozen Enforcers.\n\n**The year was 2036.**  \nDemocracy was a memory.\n\nThe resistance wasn\u2019t an army.  \nIt wasn\u2019t a movement.\n\nIt was a name.  \nWhispered in the dark.  \nScrawled on the walls.  \nPassed from one desperate hand to another.\n\n**Luigi Mangione.**\n\nThey all knew his name.  \nThey all knew what he did.\n\nAnd they all knew he had\u00a0**The List.**\n\nA document so powerful it could collapse The Board in a single day.\n\nSome said the names on it mirrored Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s flight logs.  \nIf only Trump had released The Epstein List like he swore he would.\n\nTwenty thousand executive orders\u2026  \nBut the most important one stayed buried.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause that list was a\u00a0**who\u2019s who**\u00a0of global power.  \nThe men who dictated the markets.  \nThe men who pulled the strings on every war.  \nThe men who\u00a0*owned*\u00a0the police.  \nThe men who never, ever got caught.\n\nThe law didn\u2019t touch them.\n\nThen one day, the truth came out \u2014 Trump had been bought.  \nBy the Saudis.  \nBy the Russians.  \nBy every power that ever whispered in his ear.\n\n**ABOVE THE LAW**\n\nBack then, people believed the rich couldn\u2019t hide forever.  \nThat nobody was untouchable.\n\nThen came the billionaires who hunted people for sport.\n\nWe laughed at the idea once.  \nThen we found out it was true.\n\nMade sense.  \nNo crazier than a child sex-trafficking ring run by the elite.\n\nThe Board denied its existence.  \nThe Enforcers executed anyone who dared look for it.\n\nThen one day, the list surfaced.  \nAnd so did Luigi Mangione.\n\nA nobody.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just escape prison.  \nHe found\u00a0**The List.**\n\nAnd now?\n\nFor the first time in decades \u2014 The Board was afraid.\n\nThe illusion was cracking.  \nThe torches were rising.  \nThe guillotines were being sharpened.\n\nAnd if Luigi Mangione pulled this off?\n\nThis would be the last election The Board ever stole.\n\nLuigi glanced at the stolen security tablet in his hands.  \nThe access codes \u2014 ripped straight from\u00a0**The List**\u00a0\u2014 still worked.  \nThe override would kill every alarm for exactly 32 seconds.\n\nThat was all he needed.\n\nBecause the moment Musk saw him?\n\nHe was already dead.\n\nMore [here](http://www.antonvolney.com).",
