I don't see why Ukraine is a no no but Israel is a hard yes when we talk about wasting money on wars. Also, Ukraine is fighting off an occupier, an enemy of the US, while Israel is spending its money on expansionist wars. I think there is something to gain by not letting one of your biggest enemies expand towards Europe, but hey, that's just me...",

If NATO was a big deal to them, they would've invaded the Baltic states or Poland before they could join NATO. \n\nNow where I do think NATO fucked up was in not admitting Russia when they applied after the fall of the Soviet Union, we were on good terms then.
