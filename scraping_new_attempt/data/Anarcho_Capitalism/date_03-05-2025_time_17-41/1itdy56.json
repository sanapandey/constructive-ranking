    "selftext": "Personally, I find the arguments against intellectual property as a natural right pretty compelling (though I know that's not universal among libertarians). This makes me naturally skeptical about software end user license agreements (EULA) that restrict the user from decompiling, copying, or otherwise sharing shoftware, as software (like all \"intellectual property\") is not constrained by scarcity. It feels to me like this type of restriction is wrong, but when I think about it from a private law perspective, it seems like there's no reason a producer of software couldn't request all consumers agree to such a restriction before selling them the product. I'm curious what perspective others have, and if anyone has written about this issue from a private law perspective.",

It would be a voluntary agreement that you do not copy or sale whatever you bought as no one is forcing you to buy the product.  If you did, the company could seek damages per the agreement.  \n\nWhat would change is whether those agreements would be around given the change in landscape once government coercion is removed from the picture.  \n\nI've often thought that without government, cryptology would be much more advanced as companies can't rely on  you not sharing their software with just an EULA.",

Those and agreements forbidding copying media are also morally justifiable. The ability to enforce those agreements is a separate issue.",
