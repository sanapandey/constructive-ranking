Liberty from facts?\n\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. It is typically measured by indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Producer Price Index (PPI). Inflation can be caused by various factors, including increased demand (demand-pull inflation), rising production costs (cost-push inflation), and excessive money supply growth. Moderate inflation is considered normal in a growing economy, but excessive inflation or deflation can have negative economic consequences.\n\nMoney supply growth is one cause of inflation. There are others",

Although this error as been fixed it cast doubts on the basic competency of the agency.\n\nFurthermore, Doge counts the full value of contracts even if the money has already been spent. For example, if you have a $1M/year contract for 10 years and we are on year 9 with the previous years already paid in full, Doge will list the cancelled contract value as being $10M instead of the real saving of $1M. This dramatically inflated the amount of \u201csavings\u201d and is blatantly dishonest.",

            "body": "Even if we took at face value that everything DOGE identified should be cut and they have the authority to cut it, it's less than 3% of the 2024 deficit and the probected 2025 deficit ($1.9 trillion). Only Congress can authorize cuts large enough to actually impact the deficit. The only ways to directly affect the deficit to a meaningful magnitude are to cut defense, Medicaid, medicare, or social security.\n\nThe FICA categories have their own revenue streams. SS is not a significant net contributor to the deficit. For most years since 1957, it has been net positive for revenue. Only in 2021 did it become consistently net negative contributing ~$50 billion per year to the deficit on average (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html). This should be addressed, but it's nowhere near the largest contributor to the deficit. Medicare does pull somewhat from the general fund (~$300-$400 billion recently) as its expenditures outpace its revenue. Of course, Republicans refuse to allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, which could help fight the overspending. Medicaid is a contributor as it comes from the general fund.\n\nMedicaid and defense are around $900 billion and $850 billion, respectively. And, if you want to find fraud and waste, the DoD is a good place to start as we're actually talking about numbers that move the needle ($trillions - https://coloradonewsline.com/2023/12/06/pentagon-cant-pass-audit/).",

Basically all spending must be accounted for on paper when cutting taxes.\n\nSo if they cut 2 trillion in taxes, then on paper they must either\n\n1) cut 2 trillion in spending, or\n\n2) add 2 trillion to the deficit\n\nI would love it if they would cut the 2T, but I think because so many people are so dependent on the state it would be too much of a shock to the system. Thousands would literally die before the market adjusted\n\nTherefore, we have to cut taxes and on paper justify it by adding to the deficit. Why do I say on paper? Because the tax cuts should increase revenue. Business will expand. Sales will improve. More people will have jobs, there will be more investment, both foreign and domestic. Laffer curve basically\n\nSo the only way to get the tax cuts is to justify it with a deficit. Then we can grow out of this mess. Get people better jobs. They depends less on the state, and you can continue making cuts safely. That\u2019s the plan at least",
