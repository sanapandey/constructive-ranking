The U.S. government could also close the department of energy and repeal all air regulations, ending the unfair advantages that Chinese energy, mining, and smelting operations enjoy. But that's not the situation. Seeing supposed ancaps railing against tariffs while purchasing heavily government subsidized goods and calling that the free market is the height of hypocrisy. \n\nNo matter how popular Trump is, he could never stop all of the port funding, shipping subsidies, and mothball the entire Pacific fleet. He can't close every department and repeal very regulation that has an effect on domestic companies. He simply doesn't  have the authority. What he can do is add tariffs that cover a tenth of the cost of those subsidies so that they aren't entirely financed by debt spending and currency debasement, thereby funneling money extracted from Americans to China via corporate middlemen.",

Trump also removed the $800 or under exemption on Tuesday so technically that means even a $5 purchase from China on Ebay has an additional tariff due now and you won't know how much until it hits the USA customs office and the bill is sent to the buyer, not the seller.  Not sure how the customs office is going to be set up to handle all that added work and collect those funds on such sudden notice.   Are they really going to send the buyer a bill for $1?   That's obviously not worth the hassle. \n\nFrom what I am hearing, some large platforms are both the exporter and the importer as they have facilities on both sides of the border so they can simply add the import tax to the buying price so you pay it up front and then they give it to the govt, but that won't work for small sellers on Ebay unless ebay sets up some kind of system similar to how they collect sales tax.  But it's all so sudden, no one has had time to prepare anything. I'm not even sure how much tariff tax I'd owe on my next purchase.   \n\nAlso that bs narrative Trump was trying to pull about it being to stop drug shipments is complete and utter baloney, all that stuff already went through customs inspection before, the only thing that will change now is that you'll also owe additional money.",
