That's what they said 30 or 50 years ago.\n\nYou guys will just never let reality change your opinions. You just move the date of the apocalypse back to adjust. Its like going to some cult church where the pastor announces the return of Christ will be this Friday every single sunday.",

Even if they were 100% accurate, people will not act until they are hugely impacted, if at all.  More people are losing their homes and businesses to fires, hurricanes, and floods, and they remain ignorant, many rebuilding only to have it happen the next year.\n\n\"The nice thing is that I don't need to plan for the climate apocalypse since you assure me the Trump-based apocalypse will happen much quicker.?\n\nTrump will be gone in 2 or 4 years, and things will be put back together.  Things are coming to a head for the US.",

                    "body": "Ok lets start with a short and quick lesson on checks and balances: The State is divided into different powers that control, manage and exert violence or the threat of violence upon the citizens and inhabitants of said State to keep them in line.\n\nNow, the idea of separation of powers is so that no one individual or group of individuals has full control over the means of the State to exert this monopoly of violence they collectively hold.\n\nNow, does this mean that Trump will show up next week in a balcony dressed as a Generalissimo doing Nazi salutes and the US Armed forces will be goose walking down Washington DC? No.\n\nAre Trump\u2019s actions an attack on the checks and balances of the US? Yes.\n\nIs the dude at best a Putin sucker, and at worst an outright KGB plant/agent? Also yes.\n\nTo finalize, in **theory** the sovereign is always going to be the people, the government and the State are just a bunch of people that the people designate as managers of the resources that the Nation, as a collective, generate and claim. Democracy in theory is supposed to be used to give representation to as many groups as possible and allow for this collective Heterogeneous nation (The US citizens, or \u201cEvery red blooded American\u201d) to be able to cast their vote and, in a way, have influence over the direction that the State as a whole drive their nations towards.\n\nThe attacks by Trump and Co. on the separation of powers does constitute an attempt to get that power to steer the future of the Nation away from the people and concentrate it further upon themselves. \n\nAnd obviously, no county\u2019s military is going to suddenly decide to go out and exterminate every single citizen on the streets just from an order; however, there is precedent for presidents creating \u201cUs vs Them\u201d scenarios, labeling opposition groups as terrorists and the military just going against them without too many questions, there is a balance to be had but there is not much that needs to be done to keep a population pacified, the people with guns are already mostly aligned with Trump, the ones that want to be left alone don\u2019t matter to him because the US is massive and they usually just keep to themselves in the countryside, and the people in cities do not have the stomach to support more than a thousand dead people by military, specially if the deaths are not directly caused by firearms and are just \u201cisolated incidents\u201d.\n\nI come from a dictatorship under Russian indirect rule, I\u2019ve seen their tactics to steal the freedom from the people, trust me it can get worse, we also said \u201cwell we are not Cuba\u201d and we turned out exactly like them.\n\nIt saddens me to see the US to be diminished to be Russia\u2019s and ultimately Putin, a god damned ex-KGB agent, lapdog. Whatever happened to the US that wanted to keep the influence of the Soviet Union at bay?",
