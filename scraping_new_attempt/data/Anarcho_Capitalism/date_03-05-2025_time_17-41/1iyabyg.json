Also, national defense would fit under this.\n\n- \"anarcho-capitalism does not allow for exceptions\" maybe this is true, but I would add that \"anarcho-capitalism is an ideal to strive towards.\" Javier Milei is an anarcho-capitalist in his ideals, but a minarchist in practice. He is \"playing on the field \" and scoring goals (some small, some big), whereas entrenched, stubborn anarcho-capitalists are on the sidelines, in some cases even booing him. But they are not scoring any goals.\n\n- some countries/governments are more free than others, and some countries used to be more/less free than they are now. It is important to keep this context in mind, realizing that people are products of their environment...and that progress happens only thru action towards \"the way things should be\" not from asserting that \"this is the way things should be.\"",

They are complicit in a coercion based institution.  The difference is that in a free market, bad actors can be exposed and removed. In government, coercion protects them from that accountability.\n\n>government can and should serve at least one legitimate purpose:\n\nThe state, by definition, violates property rights, it taxes people against their will. You can't have a system that protects rights while simultaneously violating them.\n\n>Javier Milei is an anarcho-capitalist in his ideals, but a minarchist in practice. \n\nReformers can make small gains within the system, and that\u2019s admirable in some cases. But here\u2019s the problem incrementalism always seems to work in one direction, toward bigger government. People argue that minarchism is a stepping stone to ancap, but historically, minarchism has been a stepping stone to bigger statism.\n\n>some countries/governments are more free than others,\n\nTrue. But a more lenient ruler is still a ruler. A government giving you \u2018more freedom\u2019 is still claiming the right to grant or restrict it. I\u2019m not saying people aren\u2019t products of their environment; of course they are. But real progress isn\u2019t just shifting from \u2018less bad\u2019 to \u2018a little better\u2019 it\u2019s rejecting the idea that rulers are necessary at all.\n\nAt the end of the day, the state is built on a contradiction - it claims to protect rights while violating them. You can\u2019t solve that contradiction by making government \u2018better\u2019, you solve it by removing the contradiction altogether.\n\nDo you value freedom and choice?  Do you care about consent?  Arguing for state control means you don't.",
