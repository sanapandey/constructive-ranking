The guys that run the truck take away your trash, which is super useful and helpful. If you wave to them they usually wave back.  Nothing else is like them.  What\u2019s not to like?  Better than those firetrucks.  When one of those stops at your house, things have gone to shit.",

The only thing she hated tho was the hot Alabama heat so sometimes we\u2019d catch her coming by our house & my mom would spray her with cold hose water (they had to wear oversized vests & it didn\u2019t stick to her like a wet shirt would lol). She would come back around near the end of the day for another spray, but she wasn\u2019t suppose to because of times or whatever. So she got busted one day & she owned up to it. The next day the boss added time (idr how much) to everyone\u2019s pay so they could swing by for the hose \ud83e\udd23. We eventually found a more efficient way to do this for them without someone needing to be home. Always love a cold splash of water on a hot summer day!\n\nI\u2019ll always have respect for yall even when you don\u2019t do it anymore! Thank you for helping to keep our streets clean \u263a\ufe0f",

It takes certain qualities that develop over time that kids simply don't consider. Things happen. Personalities, desires, values all change. \n\nI remember thinking as a kid that being an adult would be so much simpler than it actually is. I'm 26. Me and all my friends are still struggling to keep our heads above the waves. After restarting from square one like three times since I graduated high school, I'm settled on teaching English overseas in Italia. Working on saving up the money to get my TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certification and learning to speak Italian. Never once as a teenager did I think this is where I'd be now. So much has led me here. I'm happy. I look forward to witnessing the rest of my story. \n\nMy heart goes out to anyone in the same boat. Keep a smile on your face, guys. Find ways to bring yourself back to that childlike wonder about the world. There is so much beauty out there, and you are part of that beauty.",

I stopped writing after that except for what was required in school. The stuff I wrote that received good grades I tried to keep hidden, until she found that too and the cycle repeated. Then when she couldn't find any more writings, she started going after the little doodles I'd make in my notes. I even got punished for a doodle of a flower I saw growing along the sidewalk once because I was \"drawing marijuana flowers.\"  I'm in my 40's now and I'm still afraid to write.",
