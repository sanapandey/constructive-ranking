What's crazy is he probably bought this debt for pennies on the dollar - just a great example of how 'debt' oftentimes isn't real, companies aren't relying on actually collecting this debt, and debt collection is a predatory practice that shouldn't be legal.\n\nIf a hospital I owe money to sells my 20,000 of debt to a debt collection agency for 5,000, I should be able buy my debt for 5,000 myself.",
