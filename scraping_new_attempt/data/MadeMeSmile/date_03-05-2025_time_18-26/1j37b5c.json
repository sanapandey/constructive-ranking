The defence budget increase is to protect US, the UK. It's to act as a deterrent so that the UK isn't attacked and caught shorthanded. The increase on funding isn't to allow *more* to be spent **IN** Ukraine. What are you going on about? \n\nThe increase is to allow our military to re-arm itself, after years of being dilapidated. \n\nOur country is not under direct threat? Putin has literally threatened the UK with nuclear strikes several times last year. Putin's allies have over and over threatened UK's allies in NATO. Putin IS threatening the UK. If you don't see that, I'd suggest you to read more complete news sources, not the entertainment websites you seem to be getting your news from.\n\nNo one at the cabinet questioned the need of increasing the defence budget. One minister resigned because she didn't agree on reducing the foreign aid budget, which the government did. She didn't resign because the defence budget was increased. If the source of the budget had been any other, the minister wouldn't have resigned.\n\nSo, no, you are mistaken, the cabinet **is** united on the decision of increasing the defence budget. It is **also** united on UK's support to Ukraine (which is a different issue, no matter how much you try to conflate both).",

Today we're friends with this person and committed to this specific cause and we'll say more next week, next week that cause is a distraction the other party is using to mislead the public, and tomorrow that person was never a friend and I don't remember saying they were but I've only ever been committed to this new cause.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is dangerous because it's impossible to argue against (you can't use facts or logic, they'll just deny both), you can't predict it, you can't make a deal or appease them because whatever they say they want, tomorrow they can say they've always campaigned against it.\n\n\nAnd being populists, they can always say the EXACT thing to get the (more emotional, less analytical members of the) public on their side. They don't have any overarching policies, they just need to read the paper and then claim they're the only ones who care about X topic, and the media will report it because it's new and on trend and everyone will share it because everyone's talking about it anyway.\nTwo days later everyone's talking about pancakes instead and guess which politician is going to make 4 references to pancakes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIt's his thing, this video that we've all clicked on, that's what he does.\nRight now everyone is talking about the new CanadUkEuropean heartfelt commitment to Zelensky, and Nigel Farage has switched from 'Zelensky should apologise to Putin' - which he said last week - to saying exactly what he needs to for everyone to talk about 'yeah yeah Starmer was cool and badenoch whatever and hey look it's Canada - but even NIGEL FARAGE is joining in! What a day! Have you all seen this brilliant news about Nigel Farage!'\n\n\n\n\nThe man is a fucking snake, and people are only so excited because he and his right wing cronies looked so dangerous.\u00a0\nThey did not suddenly change their minds.\u00a0\nThey are far, far more dangerous now, when everyone is celebrating them and sharing videos of them despite never doing so before, despite not even liking the right wing.\u00a0\nThey've said exactly what they needed to say for a majority of decent people to finally think 'i knew he'd pull through, even he's not that bad. What a relief, to all be united, and have him on our side'.\n\n\n\n\nI don't know what the solution is here, and I'd hate to think the solution was just 'do not be happy, ever again, trust nobody and get more afraid every day', but \ud83d\ude2c\n\n\n\n\nTLDR - last week Farage was saying Zelensky needs to apologise and Trump would be a fantastic leader of the UK.\u00a0\nThis week he did nothing good, but Starmer and Zelensky both took a hell of a risk and the pro-democracy leaders of Europe and Canada stepped up.\n\n\nAnd at some point when we weren't looking, Nigel Farage has become the picture of 'even Farage is on our side now!', the bona-fide shit you not evidence of real unity and hope.\u00a0\nThat's what we're all celebrating. We're all so relieved that even the baddies are here among us, and he didn't have to do a single fucking thing to become the new symbol of hope.\n\n\n\n\nSorry, but he really makes me feel ill and misery loves company.",

America is leading the way for many right wing parties. Just pick a european or canadian far right party, look at how it has polled over the last 15 years and then say it hasn't spread.\n\nWe can't rely on the initial blowback from the Trump administration to turn the tide. The blowback from his first administration helped put Biden in office, but here we are 4 years later with Trump 2.0 which is shaping up to be a far worse beast.\n\nIt's a problem that is very much *not* unique to the US. We have to work out what criticisms right wing voters have that are legitimate and work on them, we need to find a way for our centrist parties to resonate with the population or we will all have a Trump in 10-20 years. Democracies will be lost.",

Yes, Biden won off the blowback to Trump, but it's just as true that Trump won off the blowback to Biden. Centrist parties are not prepared to fight for workers at the level needed to manage growing income inequality, oligarchy and the economic disruptions caused by big tech.",

I wonder how many men would not have died if America had done the right thing from the very beginning. \n\nThis is exactly what Zelensky was telling Agent Orange the other day. There's an ocean between America and Europe, but you will eventually feel the influence. \n\nAs Churchill is rumoured to have said: \u201cAmericans can always be trusted to do the right thing, once all other possibilities have been exhausted.\u201d And it's damn right.\n\n> Despite the fact you would have been rolled over without US involvement.\n\nYes, we desperately needed the US to fight for what is right. The fact that we needed the US does not make us weak.\n\n> Ukraine isnt even a military ally.\n\nThis is such a poor take. Russia vs Ukraine is a proxy war for democracy. Can you really not see that? Is this not obvious? \n\n> Theres no obligation for the US to support but all of the EU expects military support.\n\nUmm yes there is, given that the US agreed to do just this in exchange for Ukraine's nukes.",

If you're correct about the 150% of the NHS rate, that means I'd pay $9300.\n\nFor comparison, in the US delivery is usually over $10,000. Our insurance has a deductible that we have to pay 100% of before insurance kicks in, then insurance covers 70 to 90% of the rest. My insurance is $7500 deductible, then 70% coverage after that, so if we had a baby I'd pay:\n\n* $7500 + (30% * $2500) = $8250\n\nIn fairness, deductible is per year so I wouldn't have to pay that for the rest of the year, but having a baby here would cost me $8250. That's on top of my insurance premium....\n\nSo my insurance is basically a little bit of savings vs having nothing in the UK. Wow our insurance sucks.\n\nEDIT: come to think of it, our insurance is only savings me a little vs the UK's PENALTY rate (not sure if that is the right term, but feel like that's a good description). If I could just pay the actual rate, it would be cheaper there than my \"insured\" rate here.",

My copay is \u20ac385 per year, but not applied on GP (never get a bill from them) and specialists, so mostly meds or blood testing. I became ill during our holiday and the 4 hour long ambulance ride to the hospital back home costed less than \u20ac1000. My pacemaker was covered by insurance, but the cost of the device + operating room + surgery crew + hospital bed was little over \u20ac22,000. This is in stark contrast to americans on r/PacemakerICD sub that easily have to copay over $200.000,- and some even mentioned paying over 300 grand for a replacement surgery. My meds are also cheaper. Some exactly the same drugs from the same factory are over 800% more expensive to my american cardiac patient counterparts.*",

Feeling dismissed by historic Labour and the Conservatives, i can see the appeal of Reform. Still Reform are grifters, their solutions nonsensical soundbites, their representatives charlatans who stand for nothing (see Richard Tice calling net zero a charade while acting as lead director of a company installing EV chargers and solar), and they are absolutely infiltrated by Russian money and influence. \n\nIncumbent parties should do more to address their base\u2019s concerns, even if we don\u2019t agree with all the conclusions.

                            "body": "So here is the deal, a good chunk of Americans registered to vote never actually get off their ass to vote, roughly 30%.  So that leaves about 70% of voters making all the decisions.  If you split that again, it's about 35% Republican vs 35% Democrat.  The Republicans won by a 1.5% difference. So while I am in deep depression and anger with my countryman who put Orange Mussolini back the White House, know that the majority of Americans did not vote for Trump, no matter how many times he and his ilk spin that.  He technically won a plurality not a majority.  \n\nNot much of a consolation prize, I know but it's all I have to hang onto.  The divide is so bad here, I have lost friends and family over this.  Friends I have know for 30 years.  It's not about a vote, you realize they were not who you thought they were.  So willing to compromise ethics, values, laws, facts, science and compassion just to win.",

They had similar views for some similar figures here in the UK, but Trump has really taken it to a new level and they still don't see anything wrong with it",

Even the people, they are blind, they shit on the other party, unable to critique their own leaders and unable to say \"good job\" to anything the other party might have done right.\n\nHere in Germany we have the same problem. Even right now once the new government is formed, with the Afd now more powerful in the Bundestag, I can already sense that important decisions will be difficult to execute. Even the center and left parties shit on each other all the time, instead of constructive and productive ideas, it's far easier to trash on what you don't like about the others.\n\nLong story short, what the UK showed in the Parliament was immensely impressive. Very very much so. To show respect and acknowledge that the opposition did something good goes along way, staying strong together when it's really needed is obviously very important.\nSo the UK really are ahead of many other countries and governments and I really lived to see that and I can also totally understand everyone who stood up and said that they are proud to be British, bec you should be.",

Those indifferent, who just stayed sitting over their hands while this was happening also should feel ashamed. It's also due to their apathy and lack of interest in whatever is going on outside their little own egotistical bubble that Trump and his irk managed to grab the power they have. \n\nTrump spent his entire last term flooding the courts in the US with corrupt and partisan judges, allowing one of the branches that is supposed to hold the balance of power to be turned into a tool in the hands of the Executive branch. Trump and his irk spent 4 years demolishing and eroding the already fragile US democracy mechanisms and lots of people *still* remained sitting on their own hands.",

What he\u2019s talking about are the causal factors that go back for years,\u201d Farage said. \u201cHe promised a negotiation. He promised he\u2019d talk to Putin. And he is. This is progress. We may not at the moment like how it looks, but we haven\u2019t seen the final shape of the deal.\u201d He also called on Zelensky to set a timeline for domestic elections, while not endorsing Trump\u2019s claim that the Ukrainian leader is a dictator.\n\nBefore the tumult, Farage had actually laid down a very different marker on Ukraine. On 12 February, he [told](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-brit-ally-nigel-farage-ukraine-should-join-nato/) GB News viewers: \u201cI think Ukraine now joining Nato is almost an essential part of this peace deal.\u201d This provoked a flurry of \u201cwhat did he mean by that?\u201d discussions within Tory WhatsApp groups.

You either know that, of haven't paid any attention to anything in the last 20 years at least. Neville Chamberlain tried that with Hitler, which is the classic example that people bring up right now, and that didn't go so well. And Putin has proved time and time again that he will break any deal that is made. \n\nAnd apart from that, it is completely insane to say \"let's just abandon an ally because it got hard\". Which again, is what you're saying, let's not pretend.\n\nIf Russia invaded the UK and took all of Cornwall and Wales and maybe where you live, would you think it is an acceptable proposition for the rest of Europe to just give up and let us live under Russian rule? Would you have the same energy for that? Somehow I doubt it, I know I wouldn't. I would expect the UK allies to come to our aid, just as I expect the Ukrainian allies to come to their aid. Everyone (apart from you apparently) realises that this doesn't stop with a simple ceasefire, and especially if we just give Ukraine to Russia (which is what you are suggesting).

            "body": "In 2022, when President Biden signed on the $1 billion military aid to Ukraine, there was a heated phone call between the US president and the Ukrainian president where Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy, telling him that he could be more grateful for the US aid.\n\nBefore this past meeting between president Zelenskyy and president Trump, agreements had been drafted and were waiting to be signed. The Ukrainian president would not hear any talks of peace, and rather just demanded addtional help. Mind you, the US government has given more money in GRANTS to Ukraine than all of the grants offered by all of the EU combined. Most of the offered aid from the EU has come in the form of loans.\n\nFurthermore, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, there were agreements that promised to keep NATO from expanding interests east of the Atlantic bordering countries. Keeping NATO to the western area of the continent would have prevented Russian movement into Ukraine. The eastward expansion of NATO, the fact that there was low support by Ukrainians for Ukraine to join NATO, in addition to the support of returning to Russia (USSR) on the eastern Ukrainian/Russian border created the image that the binding of the two countries would not be hostile.\n\nSince last year, more than half of Ukraine is asking president Zelenskyy to negotiate peace, even at the cost of land concession. President Zelenskyy is unwilling to participate in these peace talks, and has taken a hard-line stance against negotiation for peace where president Zelenskyy does not receive all of his demands.\n\nNATO is still there and providing aid because they have interests in Ukraine. However, with the US attempting to pull out, NATO is reassessing what it would need to do in order to cover the costs and support that the US provides, and they do not seem capable of providing the support that we have.\n\nIn the end, it breaks down to the president of Ukraine demanding aid for a war that has no perceivable end. Meanwhile, the majority of Ukraine is asking for president Zelenskyy to negotiate peace and bring home Ukrainian sons. However, NATO is instigating continuing this war through propaganda in order to give Ukraine more loans, which will need to be paid back(these are not grants- you can look it up). There is far more to all of this than the scratched-surface of what is propagandized in social media. NATO knows what happens if America pulls out of this, and they don't care about the Ukrainian people, they care about their interests.",

However, the majority of Ukrainian people are telling Zelenskyy to consider a peace deal, and he is not even entertaining the thought of what his people are asking for. Though, the \"unprovoked\" comment aside, you make a good point.\n\nIf Mexico were to invade the US and take Texas and New Mexico, the standards of living for the people in those states would decrease. Would the majority of people of those states be okay with falling under Mexico's laws, regulations, and so forth? \n\nI don't believe they would be. I would be okay in this hypothetical, if the sitting president, AOC or whoever, took the majority of Texas and New Mexico people's desires for peace into consideration, and gave Mexico back some of the land, because it would increase or not change those people's quality of life.\n\nThis is the case with the Ukrainian citizens and Russia- the majority of people don't see where maintaining their  sovereignty benefits them more than stopping the war. NATO is offering promises and loans that will put them into economic debt for hundreds of years, and cost the lives of several generations of Ukrainian sons, brothers, and fathers. To top this off, the proposed payback for much of the loans is collateral. The bigger picture here is if/when Ukraine defaults on its debts, they will be faced with forced reforms anyways, this time from NATO. Ukraine also won't/can't meet any of the criteria to join the EU or NATO.",

Zelensky called for peace talks for years, with the Kremlin denying every one. Now that Putin is ready, Ukraine will not just accept Putins demands...it's a negotiation after all.\n\nOf course Ukranians want the war to end. The Russian people want the war to end too.

            "body": "Your view is way too narrow. Defense spending isn't just about a single number in the budget, countries contribute in different ways.  \n\nTake Finland as an example. On paper, they barely meet NATO's 2% GDP target, but in reality, they have **one of the largest reserve armies in Europe** and a strong defense system designed to fight a superior enemy (aka Russia). They invest heavily in readiness, conscription, and stockpiles, things that don\u2019t always show up in a simple spending figure.  \n\nAlso, saying the U.S. \"does everything\" in NATO is just wrong. 18 out of 31 NATO countries now hit the 2% defense spending goal, and many others are ramping up. The EU\u2019s economy is bigger than the U.S., and they buy American weapons, energy, and tech, which directly benefits the U.S.  \n\nOn Ukraine: If the U.S. stops supporting it, Russia wins, NATO weakens, and the U.S. ends up spending way more on future conflicts. Every dollar going to Ukraine mostly stays in the U.S. because it's spent on American-made weapons and jobs.  \n\nAnd tariffs? They don\u2019t just hurt China or the EU, they raise prices for Americans. Trump\u2019s tariffs already screwed over U.S. farmers, leading to government bailouts (aka wasted tax dollars).  \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about where your tax dollars go, maybe ask why Trump example funneled government money into his own businesses while in office.",

Europe become absent of world politics or at decreased it to a minimum compared to previous centuries. We focused on improving the quality of life of our people. If opened, the box of pandora and allow one country starting to take parts of other countries\u2026 history will repeat itself and not in good way. what reason will block another country to do the same in Europe? . Europe and special Ukrainians want peace but a lasting peace. Russia only respects positions of force, like Trump. If \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8does not step in we need need to get stronger so Ukrainians can improve their negotiation position, and Russia will finally understand that they Russia is a big and amazing country but is not a good idea to be starting wars. Why do you think almost all ex Urss countries are trying to get in NATO? They just don\u2019t want to be in another war or under Russia domination.",

My questions however is what is wrong with ending the war, at worse case Ukraine ceds the territory they have lost to Russia.  After that war I think they have come to realize the weakness of their military strength.  Oh and by Russia I mean Putin, we all know everything they do is explicitly by his words.  \n\n  \nI also had a realization while reading your response.  I don't mean for this to sounds as bad as I'm sure it will come across but.... It kind of sounds like Trump may be forcing Europe to \"toughen up\" without the help of the US.  not sure how accurate that may be, but it's a thought that just went through my head as I was reading.",
