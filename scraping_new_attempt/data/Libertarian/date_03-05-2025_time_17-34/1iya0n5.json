    "selftext": "HELLO FELLOW EUROPEANS. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU SEND YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE AN EMAIL MAKING CLEAR YOUR OPPOSITION TO A CONTINUED WAR IN UKRAINE.  \n  \nI HAVE COPED AN EMAIL TEMPLATE BELOW WHICH YOU ARE FREE TO COPY AND PASTE  \n  \n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  \n  \nMorning/ Afternoon COWARDLY POLITICIAN.  \n  \nIt is with increasing frustration that I read your calls for British/ YOUR COUNTRY troops to aid in the fight against a Russian invasion of Ukraine. It is my understanding that you have never before even been in a fist fight, let alone served in an active war zone, so who on earth do you think you are demanding that others kill and die for your beliefs?  \n  \nI would like to remind you that in order to put boots on the ground in Ukraine, you will need to convince white working class men between the ages of 18 and 35 to risk their lives to fight for NATO. As someone who falls into this category, I want to make it absolutely clear that I would rather rot in a jail cell than ever fight for a war of NATO expansion at the behest of cowardly vermin such as yourself.  \n  \nI do not remember ever signing a social contract, however, if ever there was one, you tore it up and spat in our faces when you invited thousands of 3rd world migrants to come here, and make life unsafe for our families and lowered living standards for entire generations of working class Brits/ YOUR COUNTY  \n  \nSo COWARDLY POLITICIAN, in this instance you can fight your own war. Send your own kids to fight and die in a trench in Ukraine. Even better, why don't you go yourself? Obviously we both know you are a cowardly fucking weasel, however, if you are going to order men to their deaths, the least you can do is to go with them. Anything less is reprehensible cowardice.  \n  \nI despise you, and everything you stand for.\n\n\n\nYOUR NAME ",
