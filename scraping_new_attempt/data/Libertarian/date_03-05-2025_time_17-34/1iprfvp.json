I don't think Libertarian applies anymore if we are actually arguing about the merits and demerits of firing government employees. \n\nThe question is not whether they are parasites (which many are) or valuable public servants (which many are). The question is how large and expensive we want the government to be and whether we are willing to do what's necessary to shrink it. Most actual libertarians (maybe 2% of this sub now) would argue the best government is the smallest one possible and we must be willing to do absolutely whatever is necessary to get it down to that size regardless of how uncomfortable the process might be.",

Being paid to do nothing is better then most of what goes on in the Federal level.\n\nBut I believe in the value of honest work.  This way they can get a job that actually benefits society and gives them a chance to make the world a better place.  Which is something that is not possible for them if they continue to work for these departments.\n\nWorrying about 'the job market flooded' is kinda like worrying about having too much fresh air and sunshine or too much cheap oil.   In the end it will be beneficial to society.",
