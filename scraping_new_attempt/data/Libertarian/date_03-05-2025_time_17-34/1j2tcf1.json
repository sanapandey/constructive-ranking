    "selftext": "I am a big supporter of challenging speech through more speech, as opposed to silencing speech, irrespective of whether its misinformed or hate.\n\nWith that said, I hope I can get some clarification on if this can be reconciled with two kinds of situation.\n\nFirst, suppose a neighbour starts blasting a speech through a loudspeaker towards someone's house. The neighbour does this from their own property. It is deafening and highly disruptive to the recipient, and so I would like to think that would count as a reasonable noise complaint even if the consequence may be silencing the speech. I'm not so sure if this violates free speech or not; arguably, I've thought it may not because it's not the content of the speech that is problematic but the noise level and so it isn't so much *what* they say but whether the noise is sufficiently loud to intervene on their private property.\n\nSecondly, should a line be drawn onto incitements of violence or things like death threats, despite the subjectivity, and provided context is considered. The issue is that if the law can only be enforced once such a crime happens, then the damage has already been done.",

Direct threats or calls to violence can, and should, be treated as criminal. Saying \"I'm going home to get my gun and when I get back I will kill you with it\" should be an arrestable offense.\n\n(2.) Your freedom of speech does not trump my freedom of association. You can talk all you want, but I don't have to stand there and listen to you until the end of time. I'm going to just walk away.\n\nNuisance laws exist and should be respected. An ice cream truck blasting advertisements over a megaphone at 3 a.m. in New York City violates other's right to not associate with the ice cream vendor. (This was an actual case that went to the Supreme Court.)\n\n(3.) Fraud is a crime and should be prosecuted. Knowingly lying to your customers or investors, cooking the books and reporting false data, etc. should all be prosecutable. Shit like what Sam Bankmen Fried did should land people in prison. The dude literally tried to flee the country with all the remaining money and had to be extradited back to the U.S.\n\nI'm not in favor of setting up any regulatory agencies  to enforce any of this. All of the current existing agencies should be abolished. This is all shit police and prosecutors can handle.",

It's remains subjective but I do think inciting violence is a unique exception that can be distinguished at least in some form. It's something that could be investigable as its a precursor to violating someone's rights. That is significantly different from if someone spreads misinformation or hate, which is much more subjective to define and its not directly harmful (because its our responsibility to evaluate and not act upon it).",
