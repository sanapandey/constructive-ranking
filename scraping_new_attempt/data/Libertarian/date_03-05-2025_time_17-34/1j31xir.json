    "selftext": "The Doge website lists savings per taxpayer at $652.17 for saving 105 Billion so far. They also list current spending totaling 6.746 Trillion as a total between all the different agencies of the Federal govt. After a quick calculation, I realized that the govt is roughly spending $43,684 per tax payer. This has to be completely unsustainable guys. How fast do you think this ship sinks at this rate? ",

(OP said taxpayer, that's what that means and that's what DOGE is using as its denominator to get the $43k figure.) We have a 27 trillion GDP. GDP is almost the same as national income but the latter is slightly harder to get -- it'll be very close in any event.\n\nIf you're trying to figure out whether $43k is unsustainable or not, you need to use average rather than median. Median underrepresents the income of high earners significantly in this case. Average is more relevant because taxes are levied proportional to income, not as a flat amount per taxpayer, and taxes are how you pay for spending.",
