    "selftext": "Is there lawyers out there that would be willing to sue the Asher police department for illegal search and seizer? I revoked consent more than 3 times for him to search my car. He then impounded it because I could not find my insurance I have insurance just could not find the slip. I can not afford to get it out of the impound lot. Nor can I afford to hire an attorney.",

Check your state laws if they searched it on the scene. Sorry that happened to you.  If you put the car in someone elses name they can't really get you for no proof of insurance since it isn't your car",
