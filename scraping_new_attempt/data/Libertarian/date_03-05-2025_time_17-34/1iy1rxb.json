            "body": "Thomas Sowell covers this issue comprehensively in Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality, and/or Discrimination and Disparities. Don\u2019t remember specifically which topics are covered in which books but both are worth reading. John McWhorter covers these issues as well in Losing the Race, and he\u2019s on the left, not a libertarian. Black unemployment, crime rates, teenage pregnancy, single motherhood rates, fatherless household rates, out of wedlock birth rates, high school dropout rates, drug use, etc were all lower before civil rights than after civil rights. Obviously I\u2019m not saying that civil rights was a bad thing or that there\u2019s a causal relationship there, but the corporate media\u2019s narrative that everything is racist and all group differences are due to racism/sexism/etc is, to put it mildly, not accurate. \n\nThe economic argument regarding the specific issue you mentioned is pretty simple. Assume black and white workers are identical in all aspects except race. If the black worker is willing to work for lower wages than the white worker because of racism, it costs the racist employer that difference per hour to indulge his racist impulses. But self-righteous white liberals (and racist labor unions) supported higher minimum wages, which removed that incentive against discrimination. There\u2019s literally hundreds of examples of this type of destructive do-gooder white liberal policy, Sowell covers them in Black Rednecks and White Liberals.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth saying that race/gender/etc relations would be much better without the corporate media and the regime constantly pitting us against each other and playing up the victimhood narrative in order to distract us from the real villain and cause of most of society\u2019s issues: the State. It\u2019s not a coincidence that wokism all of a sudden became a thing right after the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street were both pissed off at the banker bailouts and the State. They successfully used a classic divide and conquer strategy by making us fight about tampons in boys bathrooms and other bullshit fringe social issues instead of teaming up against the Fed.",

I do not think the CRA can be blamed for the negative outcomes but rather, the Great Society and the follow on by Nixon\u2019s administration.\n\nCombined with the war on drugs and I think you have a recipe for the list of negative items you listed in your comment.\n\nFor anyone who might wonder how the drug war hurt minorities, one only need listen to what Nixon aide John Ehrlichman is quoted as saying:\n\n>\u201c... by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d",

If you don't want to hire someone of a different race than you that should be your right, but it is also my right of association to refuse to do business with your business should you choose to do that.\n\nFree market is just that: Free. Here's the thing though: Even in the worse-case scenario where say, all white people decided to have nothing to do with all black people (this is a hypothetical for the purpose of thought experiment), then all of the black individuals have the right to associate with everyone else they so choose. Maybe they create their own community and businesses apart from whites. This already happens. This is why there are currently 195 different nations in the world. On the surface you might think segregation by race sounds horrific, but this is already the world we live in today. The average NPC just never thinks about it. Even liberals will sit there and tell you how horrible that idea is, then completely forget when praising the Scandinavian countries, that Sweden is 80% Swedish (white), about 3% \"other\", and the remaining could be summed up as also various non-native whites.\n\nOr that Denmark is 86.3% Denmark (white), with the remaining being in no small proportion, white.\n\nOr how Sweden is the same way. The list goes on and on.\n\nNow of course that segregation thing of the US would never happen, and chances are likely that if anything like that even came close, much of the rest of the world would basically boycott the bigoted group to such a degree that it would send them into the third world.\n\nThere are still ramifications for your actions in a free society.\n\nAlso note that if people of one race began murdering people of the other, then you're no longer in a free society. A free society is predicated on freedom, and you only have freedom when you have a state in which individuals do not initiate actions of which violate the will of other people.\n\nNone of the following are part of freedom: Rape, murder, theft, arson, fraud, assault, etc.",
