It was strongly inspired by the oppression and upheaval of social structures after the First World War and the Great Depression. People literally lost everything and the government did not get a grip on the misery, but made it worse. This is why the most radical and extreme forces were so popular. In addition, the 1920s and 1930s were a state of emergency throughout Europe, with fascism in Italy, the civil war in Spain, dekulakization and the Holodomor in the Soviet Union, etc.",

They feel ashamed by their nazi history, and if I'm not mistaken there are some laws in present-day Germany that criminalize the glorification, advocation, or defense of the nazis and the symbolism/iconography they're associated with. Germany was also restricted from having its own military after the events of WWII as I recall?",
