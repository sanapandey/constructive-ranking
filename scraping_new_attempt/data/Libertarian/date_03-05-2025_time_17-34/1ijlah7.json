I looked up \"Anti Trans\" bills and found a website that tracks this: [https://translegislation.com/](https://translegislation.com/)\n\nThey actually consider this \"Anti Trans\".  Most of the bills were just school sports, slashing DEI, bathrooms, and preventing people from being compelled to use someone's pronouns.  Didn't see anything legalizing genocide lol.  Shocking, I know.\n\n  \nEdit: Ok, so let me add to this.  I really don't see this as \"targeting\" trans people.  What this bill is trying to do is prevent schools and such from giving out what many would consider pornography to children in the course of sex/gender education.  Was that really happening here? Not that I'm aware of.  However, the WY state legislature has a history of making bills to prevent potential problems before they spread to here from the rest of the country, when it comes to social issues like this.  Unless you mean to tell me that trans people are just regularly going out there and handing out playboy mags and texting PH links to kids, then this doesn't really have anything to do with trans people.  Simply being trans in the presence of children doesn't sound like it would be a crime under this bill.\n\n2nd Edit: The point of this post is not to support the bill. The point is to show what the left thinks is anti trans. This bill is not anti trans. It doesn't even mention trans people.  The point is to show how absurd the left is.",
