    "selftext": "As per the title.  I've been angering a few of you here it seems with my questions and opinions - apologies - but I was wondering if this is because I - an atheist - have to rationalize my moral convictions differently to some of you, who seem satisfied with having acquired libertarian natural rights at birth from a deity or other higher power you believe in.  I am not satisfied with such a statement for where my moral convictions come from, why I have them, because of my nature, of how I tick.  Which is why I ask all those 'silly' questions repeatedly.\n\nSo.. any atheists around who have a thought to share?  Or anyone else who likes?\n\n*In my world - for libertarian moral convictions to prevail - they need to compete with all the other possible moral convictions that you can possibly think of and then be superior.  There is no authority that decides.. there is only competition.  I'm asking how that competition works, by what (natural) \"rules\".*  \n*The theists among you do not have this question / problem apparently, which is why in a lot of the interactions we seem to talk past each other.. IMHO.*\n\n*Cheers, Joan*",

The answer I found for myself is - via (violent) competition - just by how 'nature does things'.  This means a lot of the moral convictions I (might) have will not turn into rights, as I will not be able to successfully exercise them.  I can only exercise rights that are compatible with the moral convictions of the people around me as my freedom ends where theirs starts.\n\nWhich means, libertarian natural rights are not really rights, but moral convictions only.  \nThis then leads to the question - how atheist libertarians acquire those rights rationally.\n\nI don't believe in those rights per se.  I observe nature and expect some of those morals to prevail as rights, but that is it.",

For example, a medical code of ethics that medical professionals must follow.\"*\n* ***\"Morals*** *\u2013 Principles or habits relating to right or wrong conduct, based on an individual\u2019s own compass of right and wrong.\"*\n\n(src: [https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/](https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/) )\n\nThis means morals are personal and can be ANYTHING and especially compared among two people they can have OPPOSING morals.  There are no 'universal' morals and they do not have to subscribe to what you file under 'good'.",

In the case of the US it's 1:600k, for GER it's 1:100k, EU is 1:600k again.  This creates a goal conflict, based on the evolutionary drive of individuals to get ahead of the pack (introducing/sustaining inequality by lawmakers), while the goal of society would need to be that everyone is treated equally (for society to keep existing). If it takes decades or even centuries for the fallout to manifest within the population while the feedback loop will contain that the benefactors of such rules will have the means and power (and incentives) to influence the selection of the lawmakers..  it's a wonder it works for as long as it does tbh.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_legislatures\\_by\\_number\\_of\\_members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_number_of_members)\n\nFor Pitcain Islands the ratio seems to be 1:5, the lowest overall.

Yeah kids can't really do everything adults can, but we're talking about intrinsic rights. Life, Liberty, property. If you pass a little kid on the street, you can't just take his toy or his lollipop just because he's under 18.\n\nAnd in your example, what happens when that kid an orphan kid who has no parents to speak for him? Does he just become a ward of the state? What if he WAS Richie Rich from your example? You'd still make him live in an orphanage or foster care, even though he has means to provide for himself by hiring a staff?\n\nBut to my real point: humans are intangibly different from other creatures, because we are endowed by a Creator with these rights. If I own a horse, I can put it down if it's quality of life is deteriorating. In contrast, you can't just put down a child or an elderly person just because you determine their life to be inadequate. Humans have intrinsic value over all other creatures.",

To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens.\"*\n\n*&*\n\n*\"The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.

The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. \\[..\\]*\n\n*The concept of copyright first developed in England. In reaction to the printing of 'scandalous books and pamphlets', the English Parliament passed the Licensing of the Press Act 1662, which required all intended publications to be registered with the government-approved Stationers' Company, giving the Stationers the right to regulate what material could be printed. ..\"* ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) )",

It takes decades for this to feed-back-loop and reach the guy at the top.  \nThis also ignores that the ones who follow this extreme short term goal of maximizing their access to resources for their own survival & reproduction at the sustainability of the whole must not actually be 'functional/rational' in the sense you expect of them.  From my perspective they could well be \"Nature rolling the dice\" and \"see\" what works and doesn't.  \nI mean, a species adopts to a changing environment by random mutation and some of those random mutations being better adapted at the changing environment - thus affording the species to keep on existing going forward.  This works with or without those random mutations being sustainable or not.\n\n*\"Hence any individual in a leadership role has to behave in a social manner.\"*\n\nHitler?  Stalin?  Franco?  Kim?  Pol-Pot?  Assad?  Castro? ...\n\nTheir ability to be abhorrent selfish and ruthless gives them an edge over contenders who are selfless / humane.  Add some charisma and a populace that wants to see change, because what exists doesn't work for them.. it's inevitable.\n\n*So again - a society providing positions of power (by whatever mechanism, there are plenty) will sooner or later wind up under the control of the sociopaths, which are part of the populace due to 'survival of the species' arguments.  The only way to prevent that is to not provide positions of power - which libertarianism IMHO is not about really, as their goal is not to get rid of positions of power - as they do not (IMHO) understand how they work at the core and what all else falls under that umbrella.*  \n*I believe that because if they understood it this way, they would be able to attack the positions of power by creating competitive alternatives for the mechanisms we haven't talked about yet.*\n\n*\"Any individual who fails to conform to a socially acceptable role will be ostracized, to one degree or another, and therefore reduce the likelihood of continuing their genetic line.\"*\n\nI agree fully.",

It takes decades for this to feed-back-loop and reach the guy at the top.  \nThis also ignores that the ones who follow this extreme short term goal of maximizing their access to resources for their own survival & reproduction at the sustainability of the whole must not actually be 'functional/rational' in the sense you expect of them.  From my perspective they could well be \"Nature rolling the dice\" and \"see\" what works and doesn't.  \nI mean, a species adopts to a changing environment by random mutation and some of those random mutations being better adapted at the changing environment - thus affording the species to keep on existing going forward.  This works with or without those random mutations being sustainable or not.\"*\n\nYeah societies function just like organisms and are in a constant state of evolution based on their environment. And part of that evolution is weeding out behaviors that don't benefit it; evolution is only evolution if it works, otherwise it's cancer.\n\n*\"Hitler?  Stalin?  Franco?  Kim?  Pol-Pot?  Assad?  Castro? ...\"*\n\nMorally outrageous villains, every one. And probably sociopaths.\n\n*\"Their ability to be abhorrent selfish and ruthless gives them an edge over contenders who are selfless / humane.  Add some charisma and a populace that wants to see change, because what exists doesn't work for them.. it's inevitable.\"*\n\nThough true, none of that actually makes them asocial. It just means their version of society was incompatible with yours. They had to gather a large group of people around them to do what they did. Morality is a social construct; to be moral is to benefit your society, to be immoral is to act detrimentally to your society.\n\nSocial vs Asocial is not a moral conflict, it's an evolutionary one. And nature doesn't give a damn about your morals.\n\n*So again - a society providing positions of power (by whatever mechanism, there are plenty) will sooner or later wind up under the control of the sociopaths, which are part of the populace due to 'survival of the species' arguments.  The only way to prevent that is to not provide positions of power - which libertarianism IMHO is not about really, as their goal is not to get rid of positions of power - as they do not (IMHO) understand how they work at the core and what all else falls under that umbrella.*  \n*I believe that because if they understood it this way, they would be able to attack the positions of power by creating competitive alternatives for the mechanisms we haven't talked about yet.*\n\nWhile I agree that psychopaths and sociopaths are attracted to positions of power, and this is a very good justification for limiting the power of government; I don't believe that humans are capable of sustaining a functioning society without some sort of power structure telling everyone what the rules are. Therefore we will never be able to totally remove all the positions of power, but if we can limit how much say those people of government have over our lives, then we will thrive under our own freedom. And that is what I think libertarianism is all about.",

Hitler for example got to power with \\~30% of the vote and ultimately by degree of the president I think.. the rest of it has been mostly illegal per the law back then.\n\nAnyhow.. my knowledge about how our societies work tells me that we at present have mechanisms that are completely legal, but which benefit a few at the cost of the rest - turning those few in power/resourceful individuals (who naturally want to hold onto tat status).  Most libertarians I talked with recognize that for Intellectual Property (breaking competitive markets) and also that a ratio for lawmakers vs citizens of like 1:600k (US) is not competitive enough for the political market of ideas of how a society is to be run.  Another mechanism is how our fiat currency works and a flaw it copied from gold, the zero lower bound interest problem, which has all sorts of symptoms I can go into if interested and for which the solution would be to understand that REAL fiat money actually has got a negative lower bound which would eliminate this problem entirely (inflation tries to \"simulate\" this, but fails for reasons I also can detail).\n\n*\"Though true, none of that actually makes them asocial. It just means their version of society was incompatible with yours.\"*  When I define socialness as what the majority of that group accepts as morally OK (=> Ethics), then anyone having opposing convictions becomes anti-social in that societies context.. no?\n\n*\"Morality is a social construct; to be moral is to benefit your society, to be immoral is to act detrimentally to your society.\"*  .. (src: google): *\"Morality refers to a group's or society's values and standards of behavior \\[I would call those ethics, but whatever\\], while morals are a person's internal sense of right and wrong\"*  which means the latter can very well go against a societies morality, while still being moral for that individual.  \nSo a sociopath might act moral within his own moral framework, but.. yeah.\n\n*\"..and this is a very good justification for limiting the power of government; I don't believe that humans are capable of sustaining a functioning society without some sort of power structure telling everyone what the rules are.\"*  I agree..  but if you try to discuss this with anarcho-xy on here they'll burn you at the stake per my experience.  I got the T-shirt to prove it.\n\nWhat I know about our present and past societies is that all of them fail once individuals can get in control of the rule creation, maintenance and enforcing process. Our present societies manage this failure via 'representatives' who are members of parties.. it's like a political oligopoly. *While a dictatorship or monrachy would be more like a political monopoly.*  To prevent this failure ALL citizens would need to be involved there (rule creating/meinaintaing).. which means a form of direct democracy, where any proposed rule has to be signed off by at least a supermajority of the citizenry while abstentions automatically count as No to the proposal.\n\nThe result of this IMHO would be:  Very few rules, very simple rules, no rules that suppress/overpower minorities unless they are anti-social.  The enforcement via 3 or more branches of gov I don't see a problem with.. politicians might still be needed to actually formulate the rules, but final arbiter would need to be the citizens.  Otherwise there will be no real competition there but an opportunity for (asocial) minorities or individual to (ab)use the rule enforcing framework for its benefit at the cost and against the will of the citizens.",

I'm neither an Economist or a Poli-sci major. I came to libertarianism because I recognize that humans are easily corruptible, power attracts corruption and corrupts those who didn't start out as such. And it is therefore ideal to limit that power as much as is practically possible, though we for sure all have a different idea of what that looks like.\n\nTo me, true anti-social behavior does not require the willing participation of anyone else besides the individual. So even though Hitler achieved his goals through illegal acts and coercion, he still had a large number of people who willingly supported him. So he wasn't anti-social, he was \"contra-social\" (idk I just made that word up) his actions were contrary to the established society. But he was seeking to establish a new society founded on his own beliefs. Had he succeeded - and I'm glad he didn't - millions or billions of people may have been raised in a society where extreme racism was not just the norm but also the moral prerogative.\n\nHumans are inherently social creatures, we've thrived to the point of near planetary overpopulation because we're so good at it. But we're also very divergent in our individuality, which can be good or bad.\n\nTo answer your original OP question, the only \"Natural Rights\" we have are the ones that Nature itself gives us: Life, Death, and the freedom to make our own decisions in between.

So how do libertarians solve this for the economic sphere?  Competitive markets, correct?  This means no rules or laws or rights that would prevent competition and lead to an oligopoly / monopoly, correct?\n\nIf you look at the political sphere and understand our moral convictions, our ethics, our morality, our mindsets as ideas that need to compete for consumers of them (the citizens).. how would pure competition look like?  Does electing a minority to make laws and sign off on them resemble real competition or is that more like an oligopoly / monopoly?\n\n*\"power attracts corruption and corrupts those who didn't start out as such.\"  ..*if only a few get to decide on the rules that govern a society..  1) how likely is it they are being tempted compared to if it was all of society  and  2) how easy is it to lobby them compared if it was all of society?\n\nAnd yes, this is not implementable.  But our existing systems create rules which causes mechanisms that are anti-competitive and those are touchable. And the only way to deal with those is to compete despite the rules.  \nToo bad not even libertarians are aware of this and per my discussions so far are more like Ernst Thaelman and rather see it all burn instead of trying to possible.",

You'd get as close to liberty based on the common wants as possible IMHO, while retaining maximum efficiency that specialization brings..*\n\n*And no, I can't see how competing frameworks solve this - humans tried that IMHO - kingdoms in Antiquity for example..  they all 'joined or got joined' one way or another.*\n\n*PS: sorry for the long reply.. but what exists exists because of the (social) evolutionary process that is there, always active.

But this freedom isn't absolute. It is constrained by natural laws. Nothing is impossible, but only if obeying certain laws.\n\nFor example, natural law does not stop you from murdering someone, but it is a fallacy to say that it is your right to murder someone. The right of the other person to live comes as a contradiction, so we are simply satisfied to say that murder is an action done by a subject's conviction. What is absolutely clear is whether you do it or not, it is made possible by natural laws.\n\nIn a society, you reject murdering someone because of the rules that you agree upon (if they are broken, you get punished). Mind you, these are rules, not laws, and without rules, there is no natural punishment for murder. The positive judicary system exists solely to punish actions that are deemed as rights because reality does not offer natural punishment. For example, if I touch a wire that has electicity flowing through, I would get electrocuted for doing that. But this is a consequence, not punishment.\n\nThe problem that you have isn't natural law, or god, it is atheism. I've been a nihilist, a epistemological skepticist, a moral subjectivist, a materialist, and now I'm very much a deist. Dig deeper, because you will not solve your problem by being an atheist.",

It also didn't help that I tried to argue that 'rights' (one can freely exercise) based on ones moral convictions are based on the people around oneself, essentially an individual against a majority - which didn't work at all with them, quite the opposite.  A lot of them get very angry with this picture.\n\n\\---\n\nHm, I was hoping you'd go for 'supply and demand being free to adjust to each other' as market are rules based constructs, and depend on rules like 'you shall not kill' or 'you shall not steal' to actually exist in the first place (private property and personal freedom hang on that same thread).  \nUnder this paradigm - markets are based on rules, on laws, on rights - and these require (except for the anarchos among us) some majority rule enforcing 'thing' to enforce them.\n\nThe cool thing now is what unfree markets then are.. they are markets where supply and demand are not free to adjust to each other.. I hope you can see what the goal of that is (controlling the supply -> maximizing profit as competition can't join on the supply side), though even those can be legitimate if the majority is simply not OK with a certain supply being offered at all or only under restrictions (slaves, WMDs, etc. pp.)\n\n*Really interesting now is how a majority rule enforcing 'thing' manages to create unfree markets and then maintains them (under the umbrella of 'democratic capitalism')..  either something very masochistic is going on OR the majority rule enforcing 'thing' isn't actually serving the majority there - which is what I'm after and have 'self-studied' for the last decade+)*",
