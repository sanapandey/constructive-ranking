If a government violates your freedom it doesn't mean your freedom doesn't exist. It means that it is being violated. \n\nLiberty, on the other hand, describes when you are able to exercise your freedoms. When your freedoms are valued and protected by society you are living in liberty. When you are oppressed and your freedoms are violated you are living in tyranny. Your liberty is something that can be taken away.\n\n------------------------------\n\n\nThe tricky part is that almost everybody is advocated for their own freedom and liberty, but they are not necessarily interested in the liberty of others.\n\nThis is why you can have Marxists running around preaching about Liberation all day long. Freedom this and freedom that... but you can still call him, justly, authoritarian.\n\nThis is because they only believe in liberty for people who believe like they do and for groups of people they deem worthy and only in ways they agree with. If you are against them, politically, then they are (by their own belief system) obligated to oppress you. \n\nFrom their perspective this is entirely justifiable, because they think of people in terms of classes and groups. Some classes are good. Some classes are bad. \n\nIt is the same thing that happens when people are racist. Some races are good, some are bad.\n\nThe term for classifying people in this way is 'dehumanization'. All humans are equal, but some humans are less human because they are 'others'.",

            "body": "The Difference Between Freedom & Liberty\n\nFreedom and liberty are two distinct postulates, which when understood on their own terms reveal a deep connection between them. Both of these words signify concepts which describe an absence of restriction. In the following definitions we will explore the distinctions, and then address the connection.\n\n**Freedom** is internalized restriction. These restrictions may be imposed on us when we are conditioning by external sources, such as education, religion, ideology, etc. - especially when we are young and forming our worldview. However we can make a choice to abandon these restrictions, which may still have consequences, but we cannot be forced to internalize these restrictions. They are mental constructs that are not determined by external forces, even though they are usually influenced by them. The ability to overcome these internal restrictions requires that we accept the consequences of doing so, which are generally social in nature.\n\n*An example is a belief in the afterlife. This belief restricts how we will otherwise think and behave. We will limit our thoughts and behaviors in order to achieve admission into the version of the afterlife that we believe is preferable. We will develop an internal code that, if adhered to, we believe will allow us into the afterlife we seek to enter when we die. This code will restrict us from thoughts and behaviors that we believe prohibit us from entering the preferred afterlife.*\n\nLiberty is externalized restriction. These restrictions are, be definition, imposed upon us by those who have the power to punish us for defiance and reward us for obedience. If we wish to avoid negative consequences then we have no choice but to obey the restrictions. We may choose to accept the consequences, but their imposition will not be our choice, they will be the decision of those who have the power to enforce negative consequences,\n\n*An example is obedience to restrictive laws. If we choose to disobey then we must suffer the consequences imposed by those who enforce the laws and determine how they will exercise their power against ours. In most cases we will choose obedience, even when we disagree with the laws, to avoid the consequences. But sometimes our moral objections and conscience will outweigh our desire to avoid consequences.*\n\nThose who use their power to restrict liberties do so because they lack the internalized freedom to allow others to act outside of their own beliefs. Those beliefs may be moral in nature, but often they are beliefs which merely support their own desired outcomes. Their belief that their worldview and privilege should prevail are an internalized restriction on thought which results in the loss of liberty for others.\n\nTherefore the only way to maximize liberty for all is to maximize freedom for all, so that the restrictive agendas formed by a lack of freedom do not interfere with the rest of us. Those with a truly free mind do not wish to impose restrictions on others because they have the mental flexibility, via freedom, to respect the liberty of others.\n\nThere are certain moral principles and positions which contribute to the best outcomes for the overwhelming majority of individuals. Prohibitions against murder are the most obvious example, but this is because murder essentially imposes a restriction on others, where survival is generally taken to be the preferred outcome of individuals. But for the most part the restrictions on freedom and liberty exist only to serve selfish individuals who wish to restrict others to gain for themselves. The exceptions against unrestricted freedom and liberty are not contradictions, they are ways of promoting the greatest degree freedom and liberty for the highest number of individuals.\n\nQuantum Existentialism is an attempt to dissolve the internalized restrictions on freedom which create unnecessary restrictions on liberty. It is an attempt to dissolve the rigid belief systems which give rise to an urge to impose restrictions that lead to a loss of freedom and liberty of others, where the well being of the many takes precedence over the well being and/or privilege of the few. A freed, liberated humanity will live and let live. It will result in the greatest possible potential for individuals to achieve their desired outcomes.\n\nQuantum Existentialism rejects rigid, deterministic perceptions of reality in favor of worldviews that allow flexibility, acceptance and compassion. It promotes a rejection of certainty and absolutes by offering alternative models of reality which are not imbued with deterministic absolutes. Current dominant paradigms attempt to define precisely what reality IS so that it can then suggest how we OUGHT to think and behave. In Quantum Existentialism we acknowledge that we cannot be certain of what reality IS, and thus have no absolute ideas about how ourselves and other OUGHT to think and behave - so long as they do not behave in ways which create restrictions or negative outcomes for the rest of us.\n\nQuantum Existentialism seeks the liberation of all of humankind, as well as the well-being of the rest of the biosphere.  We vow to never impose restrictions which lead to coercion, compulsion or force in service of these ideas.",
