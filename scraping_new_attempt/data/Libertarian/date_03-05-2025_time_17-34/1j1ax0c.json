    "selftext": "As many feel, it's hard living in a (mostly) 2 party system, but that's only because we made it that way. A lot of people on edge the past few months, especially with trying to figure out who their friends and family have voted for. \"By voting for third party, you're letting the (evil) party win.\" \n\nI recently told just my friend that I voted for Chase Oliver as he is the only one I've known my whole life outside of family and trust with my info. He says that even though I wouldn't have changed the outcome, he's still disappointed that I didn't throw my support toward the more logical option. How do you go about justifying yourself to friends and family without the generic 'both parties suck' argument?",

I think twitter during Biden\u2019s term in office also destroyed it, not saying liberals destroyed it but I think the guy said that the people from both sides were being brain washed that a third party is bad and their social media platform or platforms got attacked. Which evidently stopped its growth, I didn\u2019t even know a movement was happening until he brought that guest or a guest that mentioned the failure of the movement.",

I will always consider what I feel will be the consequences and vote with an informed mind. \n\nSince 2000, it has been Libertarian because they have always been closer to how I feel, this past election in particular I saw an in depth interview of Chase Oliver with John Stossel, and with him it was more than just the party I went away feeling good about him, beyond just the party, and I let people know about him and why I was choosing him.
