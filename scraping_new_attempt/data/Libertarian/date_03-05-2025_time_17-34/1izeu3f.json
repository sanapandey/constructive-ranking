    "selftext": "This might not be the ideal sub for this question but you're opinion is the one I care the most about so I'll start here. \n\nI support Trump's corporate tax cuts because I believe in market expansion. The only aspect I struggle with is when companies use those savings for stock buybacks instead of expanding business or hiring more people. On the other hand I support businesses making their own decisions about when they should expand or stockpile funds for a rainy day. What can he done to better ensure the cuts get spent in a way that helps the average person without taking away freedom of choice from the businesses? ",

So when you have a surplus of cash, buying back stock can allow you to issue more later.\n\nRather than continuously diluting stock, performing a buyback allows you to retain equity in the business, and re-issue it if needed later down the line.",

The reason they're getting the tax break is because we're expecting them to use that money to expand the economy and stock buybacks delay or even defer that expansion completely. In that case I think it would be better to collect the taxes and apply it to the national debt. \n\nNot really a libertarian argument but I like this subreddits opinion on it.",

It's not some sagacious anti-keynesian lever pulling to juice the economy.",

I understand that the government is suppose to serve the best interest of the American people, so I\u2019m supportive of conditional tax-cuts where stock-buybacks is limited if your business is at a certain size.",
