Then he seemed to have a change of heart, he said he was wrong and maybe even immoral for supporting Iraq. He started having libertarians like Dave Smith and Ron Paul on his show. He's not a libertarian, but good on him for giving our best messengers a platform.",

Honestly, I don't keep up with Carlson guests, but sometimes a clip pops up and I think it's worth listening to. Carlson drives me crazy with his weird laugh and saying things like \"JFK WAS, in fact, killed by the CIA. I know that, as a fact, I spoke to someone just yesterday about that very issue\".",
