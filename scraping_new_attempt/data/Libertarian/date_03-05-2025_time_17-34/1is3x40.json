I'd say most people would agree with the concept of adequately taking care of the needs imposed by wartime service. However this is still divorced from the concept of why, when, and how wars are waged. One approach would be a return to the citizen soldier of olden city states, where fighting as a soldier was an obligation, duty, and responsibility of citizenship - but citizenship was also typically limited based on qualifications such as being male, of a certain age, and possibly owning land. Ideally the govt shouldn't be getting in conflict to bring with, and those that it does should suffice off of the patriotism/nationalism of the people impacted. Likewise, soldiering shouldn't be encouraged by the govt, as the issues with paying out the obligations to Legion soldiers of the polity of Rome makes evident.",

            "body": "There should be no \"reward\" for military service, since it should only be for actual defense of the nation (i.e., against invasion of its own sovereign territory) and thereby an obligation of citizenship. That said, certain military service (officer level) provides the sort of work knowledge and discipline that is valued by civilian companies, giving the applicant who is a veteran an edge over non-veteran competitors. For the others (mostly enlisted who are sent to do nation-building, world's police, etc. and who may suffer from PTSD, addiction, permanent injury), the government provides incentives for a company to hire these applicants over non-veterans. (I'm open to arguments over whether or not this is a good thing.)\n\nThings like the GI Bill (which covers some or all of the costs of a veteran's college tuition) made sense in the era when most people who went to uni did so immediately after high school graduation, and the financial support they had (scholarships and other financial aid) would not be available if they were required to postpone that education for military service (most common during times when the draft - conscription - was active). Today, when people matriculate for their bachelor's degree at all ages and stages of life, it doesn't seem as reasonable (although it may be a necessary incentive for recruitment, and for many people from lower socioeconomic classes, it's their only real shot at upward mobility).\n\nRewards such as military (and veteran) discounts at stores - like senior citizen discounts, student discounts, and educator discounts - are voluntarily provided by those stores both as an incentive, and as recognition that active military are often paid far less than their civilian counterparts (similarly, that retirees and students are often income-limited, and teachers must often pay for classroom supplies from their own pockets). Voluntary discounts fit just fine under libertarian philosophy.",
