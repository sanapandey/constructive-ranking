Kudzu was used as a field edge bc when it grows, nothing else does. \nOil spills aren't as direct, but oil is subsidized which drives people to look for more. More, potentially, means cutting corners. Cutting corners does lead to a faulty product or disaster.\nThe idea of the \"carbon footprint\" was put forth by BP to try and blame the people for the hole in the ozone instead of looking in the mirror and seeing how the company could reduce their own environment impact.\nSubsidies are a bandaid solution on a hemorrhaging vein.",

I\u2019m not a parent and I never want to be but I am going into medical and have taken maternal and natal care classes. It\u2019s a lot on the human body and needs time to recover from, and then caring for an infant is a 24/7 job and the mother being away from the child for long periods of time increases risks for the infant in the first few months of life. Maternity leave just combines medical and family emergency. Like I said, if you had a major surgery that needed weeks recovery time you should get the paid time off, and if you had a sick family member to take care of 24/7 for a decent amount of time you should get that off too.
