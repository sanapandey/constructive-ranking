    "selftext": "In response to this WSJ article https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-relationship-4decfe96 I responded with the following rather long comment:\n\n>WSJ is so desperate to see that this war continues and more people die as a result that this is the level to which they are forced to go to undercut efforts to end the war.\n\n>Here is what we know with certainty:\n\n>1. \u2060Ukraine is desperately in need of a diplomatic end to the conflict. This comes directly from the head of their intelligence from his report to the Ukrainian parliament. As reported:\n\n>\u201cFirst the General Staff representatives spoke at length, in a rather complex manner, but it was very insightful. Then there were other reports. But what stood out the most was Budanov\u2019s response. Someone asked him how much time we have left. Kyrylo, with his calm smile, replied: \u2018If there are no serious negotiations by the summer, dangerous processes could unfold, threatening Ukraine\u2019s very existence\u2026\u2019\n\n>https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/27/7495459/\n\n>2. The ability of Ukraine to negotiate has deteriorated due to military losses since the Istanbul diplomatic overtures which, according to former Chancellor of Germany Shroder, was scuttled by the US in 2022.\n\n>Source: \"At the peace negotiations in Istanbul in March 2022 with [the now Defence Minister of Ukraine] Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainians did not agree on peace because they were not allowed to. For everything they discussed, they first had to ask the Americans.\"  \n\n>https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-gerhard-schroeder-serious-mistakes-by-the-west-a-572686.html\n\n>Multiple sources corroborate this. On April 5th, 2022 the Washington Post reported that some NATO members preferred a protracted war to weaken Russia. \u201cThat leads to an awkward reality: For some in NATO, it\u2019s better for the Ukrainians to keep fighting, and dying, than to achieve a peace that comes too early or at too high a cost to Kyiv and the rest of Europe,\u201d the outlet reported. \n\n>Source: archived WaPo article  https://archive.ph/vbbr3\n\n>Later that month, while meeting with Zelensky in Kiev, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said one of Washington\u2019s goals was \u201cto see Russia weakened.\u201d\n\n>Source:  \u201c\u201cWe want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\u2019t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\u201d https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3462190-pentagon-chief-says-us-wants-to-see-russia-weakened/\n\n>Commenting on the breakdown of talks, Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu blamed NATO members \u201cwho want this war to continue.\u201d \u201cBut, following the NATO foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, it was the impression that\u2026 there are those within the NATO member states that want the war to continue, let the war continue and Russia gets weaker. They don\u2019t care much about the situation in Ukraine,\u201d Turkey\u2019s top diplomat added.\nSource: \u201c\u201cAfter the talks in Istanbul, we did not think that the war would take this long. There are those who want this war to continue,\u201d the minister told broadcaster CNN T\u00fcrk.\n\u201cBut, following the NATO foreign ministers\u2019 meeting, it was the impression that... there are those within the NATO member states that want the war to continue, let the war continue and Russia gets weaker. They don\u2019t care much about the situation in Ukraine,\u201d he added.  \n\n>https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/nato-allies-want-longer-ukraine-war-to-weaken-moscow-turkey-173158\n\n>The sad part of all this is that NATO has for the past nearly 3 years allowed Ukrainians to die to further its own agenda.\n\n>So at this point, one can wax poetic about what they think ought to be the outcome of any negotiations. But the reality is dictated by events on the ground. Thanks to the Biden Administration, Ukraine is now in a precarious situation and forced to negotiate from a position of weakness.\n\n>The idea that the U.S. or NATO or Trump is throwing them under the bus at this point is without merit. They were thrown under the bus in 2022 for the sake of extending the conflict for NATO\u2019s own purposes not for the benefit of Ukraine. Now, the current administration is left to pick up the pieces and bring the war to a conclusion before Ukraine does exactly what its own intelligence chief says will occur: collapse.\n\nThe responses are nothing short of mental midgetry. To a person, the responses have been \u201cPutin _____ (troll, bot, propaganda, etc) but not a single person has anything of substance to argue..\n\nIs this just tldr? Is it incorrect? Is there anything here that is propaganda? Are lies detected?",

            "body": "I think a fair point to make is that the US may have kept Ukraine from making peace back in 2022, but realistically without the US's aid there wouldn't have been a \"war\" in the first place as it would have been a steamroll. \n\nI also think Trump would rather be friendly with Putin than Zelensky just due to the power that he has so if throwing Ukraine under the bus gets him an ally in Putin, then it is worth it to him. I think there are legitimate criticisms to that. That you don't just get to decide who you are or aren't allies with on a whim as a president b/c it ruins the US's ability to negotiate alliances in the future if they may renegotiate on those alliances when it is convenient to the US.",

            "body": "Well reading your comments, yes majority or NATO nations would want a weak Russia. That\u2019s an obvious take. Especially after 2008 in Georgia and 2014 Crimea. Sprinkle in Russia\u2019s history of expansion ranging from Poland, Finland, Baltic States to their beginning from being a vassal state for the Mongolian empire. They have a history of just brutal expansion with no questions asked.\n\nIf you look at history, western (more importantly European) nations have with PTSD getting into conflicts and for good reason. America for most part, is willing to get into conflicts, part of that our home populace has never experienced war since the Civil War. We just got out of the longest running war in our history. On average US has a break of ~15 years of peace between wars, which is sad but if Putin was to make a move it makes sense when he did it.\n\nThe other piece to all this is majority of Russias economy revolves around energy in which they prior to the war supplied majority of natural gas to Western Europe. Majority of these pipelines go through Ukraine. Well discoveries of natural gas deposits in the Black Sea region all of a sudden made Ukraine a direct competitor to Russia who could easily use the same infrastructure to supply to market.\n\nFunny enough these discoveries are around the same time where Ukraine was fundamentally going through a government change to become less dependent on Russia/Russian politics.\n\nNow the argument that \u201cNo one wants this war to end\u201d.\n\nYes there are external players from above to want to see their greatest adversary in as much pain as possible, but to ARGUE that Zelenskyy, and the people of Ukraine, just want continuous war for the shits and giggles is so out of whack.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, they don\u2019t want war, they want their land back, so they continue what they started in reducing the corruption of their nation post Soviet collapse.\n\nBut if you know history about the Baltic regions of people, their history with oppression, they\u2019re not going to give up cause of a shitty news conference.",
