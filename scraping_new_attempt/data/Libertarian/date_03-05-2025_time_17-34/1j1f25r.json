    "selftext": "What are most libertarian thoughts on this/regarding my situation? Here it goes.\n\nSo I'm a neurodivergent adult (I have fetal alcohol spectrum disorder). While I may be \"slow\" or disabled, I don't think I'm as bad as my mom genuinely thinks I am or as bad as she has led me to believe, and most of my friends and online commenters tend to agree. My mom is very paranoid and overprotective and I am very sheltered. In her mind, she thinks she's protecting me from an evil world and maybe that's true. But at the same time, she isn't letting me grow up or letting me be an adult (and I am way past 18). I am not allowed to date or have sex or vote. I am not supposed to be on social media but I am behind her back. I'm not allowed to walk around in a store without her being by my side or within eyesight. I can't even walk up the road by myself or leave the house without her/by myself. I don't even get to hang out with friends or do any activities outside the home (except shopping or occasionally eating at restaurants, during which she's always there with me). However, doing activities like some type of recreational socialization thing or taking yoga or martial arts classes is out of the question because \"I might get kidnapped\" or \"someone might shoot up the place\" or \"I might make friends or meet people who will be bad influences or bad people in my life\". She wants me at home where she knows I'm safe. But I'm literally not doing anything with my life and I feel like I wasted my 20s, all because of her control over my life. Before you comment anything about how she cares about me and loves me (which I'm sure is true in her own weird way), keep in mind I am not a minor, I am an adult, and think about how you'd feel if you were me. Imagine how pissed you'd be if the government was stepping on your rights and freedoms like this but instead it was your parents because of a disability and the government is even an enabler.\n\nIf it's wrong for the government to limit our freedoms/rights to protect us, then why is it okay when it's parents doing it to their adult daughter or son, over a disability? In both cases, it's about security being valued over freedom and rights. Isn't there a conservative quote that says something like if you trade freedom for security, you don't deserve either? Shouldn't I have the autonomy to choose my freedom and rights over my security, especially if I can understand that I'm having my rights and freedoms stepped on and if I'm able to verbally articulate that I'd rather have freedom and basic human rights rather than security?\n\nNot sure if it's relevant for this post but my mom is super religious and a conservative Republican. I actually had a conservative Mormon friend call my mom \"a woke liberal\" \u2013 despite knowing she's a conservative Republican \u2013 because he said her thinking she knows what's best for me more than I do makes her \"woke\" (his words, not mine). But I've had people on both sides of the political spectrum say how my mom treats me isn't right and some even called it borderline abusive or downright abusive (their words, not mine). But one person in the Christian sub (I posted there for spiritual advice) told me to shut up, that I was just mad because I couldn't do whatever I want, as if I'm an angsty teenager who thinks they're grown when I am literally an adult who is grown and who just wants basic rights and freedoms like any other adult (I hope I don't have the same experience here in a sub that's supposed to value freedom and rights above all).\n\nWhat this has to do with libertarianism? Because I want libertarian opinions/thoughts on my situation since from my understanding libertarians usually value freedom over security.\n\nShould my freedom be valued over my security? Is it justified, in my case, to make me choose security over my freedom?\n\nI was even told that if I left home or \"run away\" that my mom could call the cops and have them bring me back because I'm officially diagnosed with a mental disability and she could tell them I'm incompetent and it'll be her word over mine (that's what I meant when I said the government is an enabler).\n\nSo thoughts?",

She is essentially kidnapping you and keeping you hostage. \n\nI believe you have it wrong with the belief of libertarians valuing freedom over security, but I assume to know what you\u2019re getting at here. The federal government can offer security from foreign threats without hindering my freedoms, but I believe you are referring to travel bans and lockdowns. \n\nIt\u2019s your life and your living situation, but if I were in your situation I would do the best I could to get out of there. Are you on disability? Is there a chance for you to get a job to pay for a place of your own? I know most states offer programs to assist in housing for those with mental disabilities, you can look into that. Of course, all of this in void if you are under a conservatorship with your mother being the head of it for you. \n\nIf not, I advise you to reach out to social programs and attorneys in your area to see what you can get help with and start living your life. \n\n\nThe biggest thing here is that your mother cares deeply for you and is most likely over compensating for her mistakes she made while pregnant. So with that in mind, try not to destroy a relationship with her even when you get out of your situation. If she ends it with you so be it, but don\u2019t be the one to shut the door on relationships in your life. You\u2019ll be much happier for it in the long run. \n\nGood luck",

And she claims she's my guardian. But after digging around and calling around, I'm actually doubting it. But I still can't figure out if she's really my guardian for sure or not. And I don't know what to do besides making phone calls that I've already made and ask questions that I've already asked.\n\nI am on disability and my mom is the payee. She won't let me work (she says I'm not able to and she may or may not be right about that, I don't know but I also think she wants to keep me at home with her either way). I don't even know if she'll let me move out but she probably won't considering she won't even let me walk around in a store out of her sight.\n\nI don't mean anything by asking but what does libertarians mean when they talk about freedom over security or security over freedom? Just curious. I still a say a person should be able to choose whether they want freedom over security or vice versa, especially if they understand their freedoms is being stepped on and if they're able to articulate that they value freedom over security.\n\nSorry about my post being a word salad. I get carried away when going into detail and I tend to repeat myself. I apologize.",

Most people my age are married with kids and are living normal independent adult lives. Here I am, like a forever 12 year old because of a disability someone else (my birth mom) caused.\n\nI'm not even sure what rights I do have. I tried talking to lawyers and even the police. I called disability advocacy groups and independent housing groups. And I'm still not sure. I think I've called every person in the legal field except for a freaking judge and that's because judges are typically too busy to talk and answer questions. I thought about calling a psychologist or psychiatrist to see what they think about my competence/incompetence based off of the phone conversation I'd have with said psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nBut I keep getting the same answer every time I talk to someone: am I under guardianship or conservatorship or has a doctor deemed me incompetent and it depends on all that. But that's the thing. I don't even freaking know. I tried to find that out as well and while it appears she isn't my guardian or conservator, I'm still not 100 percent sure. I'm also not sure if I've been deemed incompetent by a doctor or judge. I thought about calling my family doctor and see what information they have but I'm afraid my mom will find out if I call them about this.\n\nThat's the thing. She won't let me take any classes or shop by myself. I *could* tell her I have these rights and that she can't legally tell me what to do but I don't think that would hold much weight when no one has actually told me that straight up.\n\nIf I tell her I read online that I have rights as a disabled adult and that she can't therefore tell me what to do, she'd say \"it's not true and that you can't believe everything you read online\". And I can't tell her a lawyer or a cop told me that since they didn't and their answers was more complex (\"is she your guardian\"?, \"only if she isn't your guardian\", etc). Plus telling her I've researched all this and that I've been making phone calls or talking to people online would not be a good idea, especially when I'm still not sure what my rights are.\n\nI've even tried to find out if she could legally take my phone (which I paid for with money I saved up and which is in my name; the phone plan is paid for with *my* disability check but she is the payee) and I can't even find a straight yes or no answer to that. Even the cops didn't freaking no. It always boils down to \"is she your guardian?\", etc. So if she tried to take my phone (which would be for something like being on social media or dating apps, something other adults HAS THE RIGHT TO DO) and I called the cops, what would they do? Who would they side with? In most cases, the person who takes another person's property (like say, you bump into someone and snatch their phone or purse), you'd be charged with theft. But because I'm a *disabled adult* and I still live at home with my parents, it wouldn't be handled the same?\n\nI also tried to find out if I have sex with someone, could my mom press charges (like statutory rape charges) and I've also not been able to find that out.\n\nOf course she would say yes to all this. Yes, that she can press charges against someone for having sex with me. Yes, she can take my phone. Yes, I've been deemed incompetent. Etc. But I want to hear it from a lawyer or cop or judge. My mom could be lying to me or she could genuinely be misinformed. Or she could be right and be telling me the truth. But I don't want to go by her word.",
