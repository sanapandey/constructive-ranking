Medical Care will never be free or cheap but we can make it cheaper. Coutnries like Thailand and Vietnam have done this to varying degrees of success.",

The reason hospitals have to charge so much is they legally have to help anyone who comes through the door whether the patient can pay for it or not. So they jack up the prices on insurance companies who can afford it to make up for the losses they take in the ER. And then add the astronomically high liability and malpractice insurance on top of that. Also, I don't know that fully privatizing hospitals would lower prices like you think it would. What kind of competition could there be that would lower costs?  If someone needs a procedure done or has an emergency, do you think they want to shop around for the best deal? Sometimes, in a lot of places, there are only 1 or 2 doctors in entire cities or states who can perform certain operations.  I mean, do we really want hospitals cutting costs to offer cheaper surgeries than the hospital on the other side of town? They already cut enough corners",
