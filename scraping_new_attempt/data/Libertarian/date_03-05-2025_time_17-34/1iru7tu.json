    "selftext": "So, looking around Reddit and other social media after the budget cuts to the NPS resulting in the firing of many NPS park rangers. A lot of outdoorsy types are super upset and make it sounds like the National Parks themselves are going to close down, as if somehow that land will cease to be if somehow there aren't facilities and staff there.\n\nI have been a rock climber for about 20 years, and a general alpinist and mountaineer for 15 here in the western US. The climbing community has ALWAYS had a tumultuous relationship with park rangers, and it has been highlighted in climbing films like Valley Uprising [https://reelrocktour.com/products/valley-uprising](https://reelrocktour.com/products/valley-uprising) . They highlight how park rangers went from helpful biologist types to basically LEO's who bust skulls and write tickets all day. There are frequent fights over access and route setting, especially in National Parks.\n\nSo I'm really surprised to see the climbing subreddits go all apeshit about against this. I can't post there because I don't have enough karma so I figured I'd see if anyone else here has noticed this. I thought we all collectively didn't really like park rangers?\n\nPersonally, I can count on one hand the interactions I've had with park rangers while I've been recreating in the parks across the US, and it was never a value added. In fact, they always are quick to go from friendly to know-it-all assholes with an authority and rules/regulations buzz, a lot like ski patrollers.\n\nI don't get it. Like yeah, it's never great when people lose their jobs they're passionate about, so I feel for them there.\n\nEdited to add: y'all are a weird breed of Libertarian then. NPS and NFS take on the flag of \"conservation\" and make insane rules and regulations around access and use without any oversight or input from the public who...you know...owns the land? I don't want resource extraction companies to just run roughshod over the land either, but I also don't want an unelected bureaucrat telling me the manner in which I can recreate on the land, so long I am doing so in  a way that doesn't leave garbage and doesn't cause permanent damage. \n\nI didn't realize Libertarians simp so hard for a bureaucracy that lost its way from it's roots as stewards and educators to it's military police style know-it-all nature nazi's.
