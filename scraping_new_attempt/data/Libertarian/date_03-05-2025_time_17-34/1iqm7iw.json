I made it up.\n\nProblem with calculating govt costs is that they aren't transparent.\n\nThere's more to \"admin costs\" than people realize.\n\nTraditional overhead includes things like buying the land to make a building, construct a building, pay maintenance on the buildings, pay employees wages, hire more employees than normal (negative economies of scale), fund pensions and healthcare plans.\n\nBut there's more than that sadly.  It cost money for govt attorneys and political figures to regulate the legislation.  There's a cost to that.\n\nThere's also the opportunity cost.  What could that land, those employees, and the other overhead be producing if it were a private business?\n\nOur govt doesn't have open accounting so we can't actually calculate this.  They will move money through different committees, funds, etc.  it won't be under the blanket of \"Social Security.\"\n\nI doubt our govt is giving money away for 8 cents per dollar.  Most non-profits aren't hitting that and our govt is significantly less efficient.  Remember negative economies of scale.\n\nThere is no real number and I exaggerated a number to show that transparency does matter.  If we know what we're paying then we can make a real decision.  If it costs $1.50 to send $1 to social security recipients then its probably a good deal imo.  They steal so much it's insane.\n\nI'd recommend looking at the origin of social security and seeing how badly they ruined it.  It's not even close.  Can't trust a govt with our money.  Charity to elderly is a private matter.",

The grift will just move to other sectors like military spending, or Federal Highways and Roads.  As long as we have any services from the government, and we haven't reformed those underlying ssues in our political system, then grift will continue and I definitely want some services from the gov, like well maintained public roads.  \n\nThrowing out something to be rid of a parasite is only useful if it gets rid of the parasite.",

Doesn't matter if you fill every political position with your saints.  It's systemic, a design of the system (enter a picture of Morpheus).\n\nThere are negative economies of scale for any public venture.  Sometimes that's necessary, but it's egregious.  It's best to keep govt as local as possible.\n\nAs an example, think about this.  Has an HOA ever successfully implemented a program for social security?  A town?  County?  State?  We jumped right to federal, the most inefficient possible.  This type of program isn't tested at a smaller scale, which has the best chance to work.\n\nIt's easy to blame corporations, greedy individuals, etc.  It's systemic.  Every government everywhere that doesn't privatize it's problems will steal and create more problems.\n\nSocial Security doesn't even make sense from a logical point of view.  It's mandatory with no way to opt out.  Have a disease that won't let you live past 50?  Can't opt out.  Plan to leave the USA after x years?  Can't get your money back.  It's just a scam from the beginning.  There were never good intentions and it was systemically designed that way.\n\nAdam Smith and Milton Friedman talked about similar points centuries and decades ago.  This isn't new information.",

It's a feature, not a bug. So SS will never be the best option, but it's what we have now and is comfortable (and is popular with the elderly, obviously, who are more politically engaged and vote in higher numbers), so they keep kicking the can down the road.",

This discussion isn\u2019t about \u201cpunishing anyone\u201d it\u2019s about math and the programs unfairness and lack of solvency. \n\nPeople are advocating to allow future enrollees to opt out, or pay out enrollees that have no hope of collecting SS as things stand, give them their money back and stop taxing them in such an insane way. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard anyone saying we should stop paying currently retired people, just that we HAVE to face reality, there is not enough money for SS to continue this way, they\u2019ll either keep pushing back the retirement age, or reduce payments over and over again until the younger generations of today receive a pathetic little stipend at age 79 that can\u2019t even pay for them to eat food.\n\nAs others have mentioned, SS is double what you think it is as well given that an employer has to pay their portion as well. \n\nGiven that basic economics states taxing something will mean less production and utilization of that thing, how could it possibly benefit the American working class to tax their labor at 12.4%? I\u2019m serious about this, how can it possibly benefit the working man to make his labor more expensive without him seeing an extra dime of the money?\n\nGod forbid you have a heart attack at age 55, now every penny you paid is forever out of reach, you just got to live with the pleasure of losing 12.4% of your money for NOTHING!\n\nIt\u2019s a bad system, and if I could opt out today I would, despite the fact I\u2019ve had to pay in for years at this point.\n\nImagine this as well, SS is changed to 5% total and is invested in a personal 401k style account for each citizen, you would end up with DRASTICALLY more money at retirement age and you would have paid drastically less to the fed over your lifetime. So what\u2019s the advantage of this dogshit SS system?",

I got the basics: tax is theft, personal responsibility, get rid of big brother, forced participation is bad, etc.  I just want to gauge the libertarian perspective on addressing some of the challenges with adjusting SS as it currently exists to a more sustainable and beneficial program.\n\nSS pays out ~85% of its funds for old age and survivor insurance\u2026which is largely what people think of when discussing SS.  Outside any libertarian philosophy, I see that shifting to a personal investment type program (high yield savings, 401k, etc) would provide significantly greater returns while greatly reducing government expenditures.  This sounds great for new workers entering the employment pool, but what about those who are currently on SS, or will be in the next 10-20 years.  How would a transition to this type of program functionally work without screwing people who have paid for SS their entire adult life?\n\n~15% of SS withholdings pay for disability insurance.  How would the free market replace this?  It doesn\u2019t seem as clear cut as old people SS.  If somebody breaks their neck between 25-35, it is highly unlikely that personal savings or investments will have grown enough to cover their living expenses for the rest of their life.  What is the libertarian plan for these situations?  Hope that charitable organizations cover the bill? Rely on personal disability insurance that may or may not deny the claim(assuming the individual purchased a plan), place the burden entirely on friends and family?  Accept that some people are unfortunate and let nature take its course?\n\nI\u2019m very interested in ya\u2019lls perspective!",

The first group is people currently on SS or about to start.  Nothing changes for them.  They can\u2019t go back in time to save for retirement, so they get SS.\n\nThe middle group pays into SS.  But not for their entire lives.  They get reduced or no SS benefits.  Instead they get X number of years to invest the money they would have paid into SS.  This group is actually a bunch of smaller groups on a sliding scale gradually moving towards paying less into the system, and taking less out.\n\nThe final group is the end result.  These folks pay nothing in, but get nothing back and can instead invest the money they would have paid into better retirement vehicles.\n\nThat\u2019s a really broad overview.  The process would take decades, but doesn\u2019t leave anyone to fall off a cliff and mitigates most of the generational screwing we\u2019re currently headed towards.\n\nThe podcast is pretty short.

It's good not to be a leech, but the debt you have for your upbringing is still heavily in their favor. \n\nThis is where libertarians lose people. Individualism isn't about the single person. \"Individuals\" are actually the family unit. The family unit has to be the base unit in a functional free society. You're not going to let your kids starve to death because it's not their responsibility to feed themselves. As family members grow up, their contribution to that family should increase, their personal responsibility increases, reducing the \"burden\" on the more senior members. As the senior members age out, they'll need the help they gave to the young returned to them. Doing what's best for your family is the goal. Otherwise, why not spend the kids' college fun on hookers and blow? It's your money after all. \n\nAnd we're talking about grandpa here. If he's an individual looking to avoid being a burden, he should sell all of his belongings, convert every last dollar to hedonistic pleasure, and then check out. The society devolves from there.",

It is not up to you or me or some politician to take other people\u2019s money at gun point and save them.\n\n2.  Government has repeatedly abused its control of these funds and shouldn\u2019t be trusted to be a good steward of this money.  I see people in other comments arguing in favor of Social Security because we can\u2019t trust Mildred to save money for her retirement.\n\nSo you think we should trust the government with Mildred\u2019s money?  You think the government will make better decisions than Mildred?  Did you forget that these are the people who can\u2019t fix potholes, routinely overpay for hammers and toilet seats, spent 20 plus years fighting a useless war and not only lost, but left everything behind for the enemy, and poisoned a city full of people by giving them shitty water.  \n\nThese are the people we should give our savings to?\n\n3.  Social Security is simply just a bad investment.  The returns on a simple index fund are much better than anything you\u2019ll get back from SS.  So, not only is government extorting you now, in your prime earning years, it\u2019s also robbing you of future earnings and growth by forcing you to use its retirement plan.\n\n4.  And how much does it cost to run Social Security?  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more than the fees I pay on the low cost index funds in my Roth.  Orders of magnitude more.  When has adding layers of bureaucracy and complexity ever brought costs down?\n\n5.  Social Security creates a moral hazard.  Some of you folks are so worried about how your neighbors spend their money, you never consider the damage your good intentions might do.  Perhaps Mildred would\u2019ve chosen better retirement investments than beanie babies if she didn\u2019t feel like she had SS to fall back on.\n\n6. It\u2019s failing anyway.  SS relies on large part on a growing population.  People paying in now aren\u2019t saving for themselves, they are paying for current retirees.  Future workers will be paying for current workers.\n\nExcept birth rates are dropping, and immigration into the country has some -ahem- issues as well.  So while the population is currently growing due to immigration, it\u2019s unwise to depend on that continuing to fund your retirement.\n\nBottom line, social security sucks.  If I could get all the money I was forced to pay into it back I would, and would immediately put it in index funds.  If I could burn the system down I would.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering about ways to phase it out, the guys from the Words and Numbers podcast did an episode with a good plan.\n\nAnd for the busybody do-gooders who just can\u2019t leave people alone, here\u2019s a compromise plan\u2026\n\nGet rid of social security.  Replace it with mandated investments in funds managed by private firms like vanguard, fidelity, etc.  low cost index funds.  Just set a percentage or something that everyone must invest to replace FICA deductions.  Enforcement can work like the early days of the ACA when you had to prove you had insurance.  Don\u2019t even need new forms since you\u2019ll get a 1099 anyway.",

The problem is what should it turn into and what are the alternatives.\n\nThe existing private sector alternatives and their for-profit nature are extremely friendly to the big corporations running them with fees and control and other too big to fail aspects, and are tied a little too much perhaps to the gambling casino vibes of the stock market at large. Those institutions would absolutely love to get rid of social security and get their hands on control of all that money, fees, permanent contracts, etc, and we should not be lining up to gift them that. They dont deserve it if so many americans are entering retirement age with no financial plan. They are probably lobbying Republicans hard for it tho, for exactly the reasons above and the lucrative possibilities.\n\nThe best solution, imo, would be in the spirit of what social security was meant to be. It's a retirement safety net for the working class. Eg, people that work their whole life for the American economic machine and then reach near end of life retirement time completely physically and mentally spent and have very little to keep them out of poverty or death. It seems wrong to have yet another aspect of their life exploited by big business for profit.\n\nSo, if there's a way to design an investment vehicle that honors that, its what I would support. Let's not be sending 1% to a billionaire. Let's not be applying for-profit denials and cuts. Those ideas run against the spirit. So we are already well outside of the realm of possibility for what would probably be allowed to happen by the titans.\n\nWhat could it look like though? Could it be a nationalized corporation in a core industry that doesn't typically allow for a lot of free market competition? Could it be mostly ownership of portfolio of rare valuable resources expected to appreciate over time? Or maybe ownership in trumps soverign wealth fund? Could it have a structure that somehow avoids typical private sector extreme stratification of pay and power toward the top, like can we have a leadership structure that isn't getting 40m a year and beholden to powerful private forces? Or that rotates and has rigorous oversight? Idk.\n\nOverall, i guess I just don't think more money flowing through the controlling hands and tolls of the existing private sector institutions is going to be good for the working class moving forward. They could just as easily fabricate or neglectfully end up in a breach of contract on it when a lifetime payer is starting to withdraw.",

How about I send Government Guns to your house to take 12 % of your income this year, and EVERY year, to help me. And how about government wastes a lot of that money, before transferring it to me.

The best part of doing it yourself is that along the way, you HAVE some of this money, ready to go, if you need it. Did I mention that if you die at 70, your heirs get a grand total of $250 from Social Security ? When they could have had that full $14 million dollars. THIS is the unseen, this is the cost of (not) helping the elderly, helping them out of 14 million dollars, THAT is the 'help' that you get from government !",
