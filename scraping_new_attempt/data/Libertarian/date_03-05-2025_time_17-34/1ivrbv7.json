The US Treasury department operates off of your taxes. \n\nThis credit is then used by the banks that own shares in the Federal reserve to \"print money\" and then lend you this money with interest. \n\nSo you pay taxes so that banks can create money out of thin air and then change you interest for it. It is free for them. For you you have to pay interest.\n\nThat is it. That is how this system currently works in the most simplistic, but meaningful way possible.",

                    "body": "You\u2019re misunderstanding how modern monetary policy works and why the Federal Reserve exists in the first place. The idea that banks \"create money out of thin air\" and \"charge you interest for it\" without any economic function ignores the entire reason we have a central banking system.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down properly:\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfdb I. The Purpose of the Federal Reserve: Stability, Growth, and Liquidity\n\n1. The Fed Prevents Economic Collapse\n\n\u2714 Before the Fed existed (pre-1913), financial panics and bank runs happened regularly.\n\u2714 If the Fed didn\u2019t exist, there would be no lender of last resort, meaning any financial crisis could collapse the economy completely.\n\u2714 The Fed stabilizes banks and ensures liquidity, which prevents catastrophic failures like the Great Depression from happening again.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 You think the system is bad now? Try going back to the 19th century when economic collapses happened every decade (the instability of capitalism that led to the Devil of Communism!!).\n\n2. The Fed Manages Inflation & Interest Rates to Keep the Economy Growing\n\n\u2714 The money supply must grow with the economy\u2014a static currency leads to deflation and economic contraction.\n\u2714 The Fed adjusts interest rates to prevent overheating (high inflation) or stagnation (recessions).\n\u2714 Without these adjustments, economic cycles would be far more extreme and destructive.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Would you rather have controlled inflation or wild boom-bust cycles that destroy entire industries overnight?\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 II. \"Printing Money\" Isn\u2019t a free Handout\u2014It\u2019s a Necessary Economic Tool\n\n\ud83d\udcdc 1. Banks Don\u2019t Just Print Money for Themselves\u2014They Expand the Economy\n\u2714 The money banks lend out goes into businesses, homeownership, and investments.\n\u2714 The economy functions on credit expansion, which enables job creation, infrastructure, and wealth generation.\n\u2714 Without new money being created, economic growth would be permanently constrained.\n\n\ud83d\udcdc 2. The \"Money Out of Thin Air\" Myth\n\u2714 Money creation is backed by real economic activity\u2014loans, investments, and productivity.\n\u2714 If banks didn\u2019t lend money, most people wouldn\u2019t own homes, start businesses, or invest in education.\n\u2714 The idea that money should be tied to a finite resource (gold) ignores how economies actually function.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Economic expansion requires an expanding money supply. A fixed supply would strangle growth.\n\n\n---\n\n\u2696\ufe0f III. Taxes & Interest: Why They\u2019re Not What You Think\n\n\ud83d\udcdc 1. Taxes Aren\u2019t \"Funding the Fed\"\u2014They Manage Government Spending\n\u2714 The Fed operates independently of Congress\u2014it doesn\u2019t use tax revenue to function.\n\u2714 Taxes fund government programs, infrastructure, and services\u2014not \"printing money.\"\n\n\ud83d\udcdc 2. Interest Exists Because Money Has Value Over Time\n\u2714 Borrowing money means you are using resources that could be deployed elsewhere.\n\u2714 Interest rates are how banks manage risk and ensure capital is used efficiently.\n\u2714 Without interest, nobody would lend money, and economic growth would grind to a halt.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Banks aren\u2019t \u201cscamming\u201d you by charging interest\u2014they\u2019re keeping the financial system functional.\n\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd25 IV. The Final Thought: Ending the Fed Would Be a Disaster\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 A world without the Federal Reserve would be far more volatile, unstable, and prone to financial collapses.\n\ud83c\udfc6 The Fed doesn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d from you\u2014it ensures liquidity, regulates inflation, and supports economic growth.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Money creation isn\u2019t a conspiracy\u2014it\u2019s a necessary function of a growing economy.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Want to see real economic chaos? Try abolishing the Federal Reserve and see what happens. \ud83d\udea8",
