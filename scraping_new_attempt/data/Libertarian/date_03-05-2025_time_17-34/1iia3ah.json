In theory the accountability mechanism should be elections but our rigged two party system in combination with major incumbency advantages prevent change.  Factor in the unpopularity from simple minded folk to cut their \u201cfree stuff\u201d and nothing ever actually gets cut for fear of political fallout, and the heartless meany conservative propaganda.  Everything just grows trying to solve the next 5 problems they created by \u201csolving\u201d the last one.\n\nThe mindset of Democrats whether they can comprehend it or not is forced control over your behaviors.  Ask a typical dem why they\u2019re ok with taxes coming out of their paycheck to fund social programs etc and they\u2019ll say things like I don\u2019t mind because it goes to help people.  \n\nSo here\u2019s the logical exercise, we can remove all these taxes, and said democrat is still free to donate their paycheck to social services on their own free will.  Instead they think it\u2019s morally righteous to cast votes to force all people to pay into these programs at gunpoint.  It\u2019s a really fucking insane mindset when you break it down",

The metric the graph uses (NAEP long-term trends assessment) tests at ages 9, 13, and 17. \n\nThe other two age groups saw increases in test scores. From the [NCES website](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/main2012/2013456.aspx):\n\n>Both 9- and 13-year-olds scored higher in reading and mathematics in 2012 than students their age in the early 1970s. Scores were 8 to 25 points higher in 2012 than in the first assessment year. Seventeen-year-olds, however, did not show similar gains. Average reading and mathematics scores in 2012 for 17-year-olds were not significantly different from scores in the first assessment year.\n\nAlthough in aggregate the demographic was stagnant, lower performing 17-year-olds (those in the 50th, 25th, and 10th percentiles) saw gains between 1978 and 2012. \n\nAlso note that the scores are drawn from small sample sizes. For example, students are evaluated on mathematics by responding to questions \"[in three 15-minute sections. Each section contained approximately 21 to 37 questions](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/publications/main2012/pdf/2013456.pdf).\" So that's 63 - 111 questions in total. \n\nDoes this justify the rapid increase in spending? Not necessarily, but it would be helpful to understand where the spending went given the drastic changes in student needs (e.g., disability accommodations) as well as get other metrics (e.g., graduation rates) to get a better picture.",

According to Education Week, students in special education in 1976-77 comprised 8% of the overall student population. Today, that number is 15%.  \nSource: [https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-number-of-students-in-special-education-has-doubled-in-the-past-45-years/2023/07](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-number-of-students-in-special-education-has-doubled-in-the-past-45-years/2023/07)\n\nAccording to another article in Education Week, which cited some cost numbers specific to Pennsylvania, the average cost of educating a student without disabilities was about $22k per year. For students with disabilities, it was notably higher, ranging from $27k to $82k per student per year. For about 11% of students with disabilities, it was more than $82k per year.  \nSource: [https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-much-does-special-education-truly-cost-finally-an-answer-is-on-the-horizon/2024/08](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-much-does-special-education-truly-cost-finally-an-answer-is-on-the-horizon/2024/08)\n\nSo yes, educating students with special needs has increased education spending drastically. It's not the only driver of increased costs, but it's a significant one.",
