It's not that Libertarians want a monarch or dictator, they just don't want 51% of voters to dictate what happens to the other 49%.They want a whole new structure where nobody has power over another. Imagine if nobody could pass a law restricting what you do as an individual. Libertarians want everyone to do what they want with no restrictions, other than actions that violate the NAP or non aggression principal. Thank you for coming to the subreddit to ask the question, it's an important one to ask, and I'm sorry people are rude here sometimes.",

We strongly oppose both monarchy and dictatorship. Your confusion comes from not understanding fully our ideology. \n\nWe think people should be deciding for themselves, not being decided for by anyone. That is liberty.\n\nYou are stuck with what you understand, which is various forms of government where someone decides for you.\n\n>What happened to libertarianism meaning very small government that's not involved in people's lives?\n\nHow about no government. Rule of the self by the self, that is libertarian. Form communities of legal agreement. Decentralized governance without monopoly government.\n\nThat rules out monarchy and dictatorship, which are our complete opposites.",
