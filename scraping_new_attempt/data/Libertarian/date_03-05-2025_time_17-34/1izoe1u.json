    "selftext": "I've been going down the rabbit hole of anarcho-capitalism / voluntaryism. I did come to the conclusion that \"open\" borders would be the end point of an \"anarchist\" \"state\", like hoppean covenant communities. I put open in quotes, because as such the right to association by proxy is the right to non-association, and these communities would decide on individual basis whether to allow an immigrant in or not. As well, immigrants wouldn't devalue currencies for communities unwillingly to accept them, as they may have their own form of currency. For slight context on this assumption, immigrants often send money back their own countries, which does in fact devalue the currency. I digress, but that being said, it's not *always* a net negative to spread your currency. \n\nI think this has been a major hurdle for Libertarians to hop (pun intended). The candidates for the last 4 elections have all been for either open or weak borders, with Ron Paul being the last strong border candidate. One quote that actually made me laugh out loud, was Gary Johnson's, 'Let the Mexicans in, and make them taxpayers'. Make them what now? Anyways the reason why this is such an issue is because, under our current system, Open Borders would allow immigrants in to move into your neighborhood and devalue your currency, without your consent. This is a massive infringement on your right to association, and the devaluation of your money is an infringement on your private property rights. But hey, as long as the majority voted on it right? \n\nYou're not going to make progress with socialists/communists, as their authoritarian nature prevents them from being libertarian in general. They'll have to realize for themselves their goals are in fact aligned with ours (affordable healthcare, education, food, housing...), but that the solution is less state not more. For Republicans, however, we should strike while the iron is hot. Most people in general are aligned with libertarianism, they just don't realize it. This is especially true on the right, but that one hurdle, for me at least, that prevented me from voting for libertarians in 2020 and 2024 is this exact issue. Open borders are an end goal, not a means. You're not going to win over Republicans by contradicting their #1 priority. \n\nI think this last election has really hurt Democrats and put their party into absolute turmoil, I wouldn't be surprised if they almost outright dissolve completely. I'd really like to see Libertarian vs. Republican as the (unfortunately) 2 parties moving forward. \n\nThoughts, comments, questions, concerns?\n\n",

Other examples of these kinds of issues are: what the speed limit should be on a public road or what the curriculum should include at a public school. \n\nThe basic libertarian argument against open borders is: just because some land is owned by the government doesn\u2019t mean everyone in the world has an equal right to it. We don\u2019t allow homeless guys to do homeless guy stuff in public elementary school bathrooms, even if they\u2019re US citizens.",

For those already here, they would benefit by having more people to sell products to and an increased work force.

If their was no welfare state, they couldn't be a burden on the state because the government wouldn't be handing out money to them.  Do you think the USA would be in a better position now if they had more restrictions on Immigration before 1913?",
