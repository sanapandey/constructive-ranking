One that all three countries would profit greatly off of.\n\nTrump come in and tried to bring peace to the region.  Joe took over, things blew up.  Trump comes back, the damage is done, the deal has been made, so he decided he'd take responsibility for the people and see to it they were settled elsewhere with a chance at really living in peace.\n\nHe even speculates that many people involved already \"own\" pieces of property in the area. If the plan goes through it's not so much the countries involved would benefit (they will), but the politicians will get fat pockets.\n\nAnywho, that's his understanding from whatever pods he follows.  \n\nTLDR;  Palestinians are dying because leaders of Iran, Israel and America want money to line their pockets.
