Perhaps it is, if enough people vote for it, they can vote their liberties away. That much I've understood. What I don't get is what the think is a viable alternative, and how those alternatives aren't also an equal or greater threat to liberty.",

In practice, I can't help but feel like the largest holders of wealth would become a de facto government and be able to impose their wills on whoever they'd like. I dunno. It sounds like a shitty idea tbh, but so does democracy without restraint.",

The matter of WHEN the consciousness develops is an entirely different issue. The moment the consciousness is created (Whenever that is) You can no longer act coercively against it, THAT is when the NAP starts applying. the NAP does not apply a Hypothetical being. You can't claim to be a victim of future aggression.  You cannot be a victim of aggression before you even exist. \n\nanyways, as for when that happens, is entirely up for debate. I personally believe it is on conception, it is however pretty obvious it happens at least sometime DURING the fetus' stay in the womb if not prior to it. but really the topic then becomes \"Is abortion against the NAP\" not \"Is birth against the NAP\"",

If Biden is going to be blamed for culling too many chickens or (previously) for government inspired inflation, or Trump in the future might be blamed for culling too much, then it should be true.  Lots of people are now advocating for an end to foolish Biden-era culling because it causes high prices.  Getting the reasons wrong leads to foolish and dangerous answers.  We also seem to think it\u2019s a metric of basic good governance.  We should know what\u2019s happening to judge that.\n\nCanada has to truck similar distances and it has had regional cull shocks.  The whole nation maintains low egg prices.  They\u2019ve done better than every state and our nation.  I can\u2019t find a single data point that shows they killed a lower percentage of their national flock than we did, even though both nations think (on feelings as far as I can tell) that Canada was hit less hard. I think that\u2019s because they had small culls more places whereas we had massive culls fewer places.  I might be wrong, if so it\u2019s still not a culling issue.  It\u2019s certainly also not a less government oversight and regulation issue.\n\nIf we did exactly as they did, we\u2019d have the same result.

In a way this entity, which most times is represented by the government, is able to make decisions for a certain population. If there's no option to live without this entity, the system is inherently flawed. \n\nIn other words, let's say you have a neighbor who really hates chocolate and doesn't want to see chocolate around. Let's say you love chocolate, and chocolate does good for your health and well being. In a democracy, since decisions are made by a centralized entity, neither you nor your neighbor have autonomy to choose if chocolate will be sold or not. Since everybody gets to choose, no one gets to really choose about their own life. They're always trying to influence the centralized entity (the government) to be on their side so they can have their way for a brief period of time. If democracy is on your side, you're inherently invalidating someone's \"rights\" because it's democratic and that's fair.\n\nThe alternative is always decentralization. If you can choose to have chocolate in your house and your neighbor can choose to not have chocolate in theirs, everybody's \"rights\" are preserved. If your neighbor doesn't like to live next to a chocolate eater they can live somewhere else. If you throw chocolate at your neighbor's house, he should be able to complain to a decentralized tribunal and have a trial for this. If this said tribunal sees that you're right, your neighbor should be able to appeal to another jurisdiction to solve this issue. The alternative is always decentralization, and never choosing which one or which group gets to enjoy centralization.",

                            "body": "The paranoid [John Birch Society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society) (who believed water fluoridation is a Communist plot, rather than an effort to improve dental hygiene after observing the teeth of WW2 draftees) loved [saying](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/02/republican-extremism-and-john-birch-society/617922/) America is a republic, not a democracy (you can see this nowadays when Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee, who is from Arizona, tweeted that \u201cwe\u2019re not a democracy\u201d and \u201cdemocracy isn\u2019t the objective\u201d), and low-information Republican voters latch onto that saying, because \u201cRepublican\u201d has the word \u201crepublic\u201d in it (see? Republicans are the \u201creal\u201d Americans /s) and \u201cDemocrat\u201d is a spin-off of \u201cdemocratic\u201d based on \u201cdemocracy\u201d (ergo, not real Americans, because they don\u2019t understand or love America /s). Also, the pledge of allegiance says \u201cand to the republic for which it stands\u2026\u201d But when GWB invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, didn\u2019t they say America was exporting democracy? They didn\u2019t say the US was trying to make Iraq a republic, they allegedly wanted to give citizens the right to vote for their leaders (democracy).\n\nBut how do representatives get elected in a republic? In a democratic republic, you elect representatives by democratic elections, where adult citizens each get a vote, and each vote gets counted, and the candidate with the most votes wins. When people are denied the right to vote, when votes don\u2019t get counted or get discarded, and when candidates with less votes wins, then democracy is being thwarted, and the GOP today is fine with that, because their extremist opinions are actually unpopular with \u201cwe the people.\u201d\n\nSo America is a **constitutional, representative democracy, presidential republic under federalism**. Unlike the autocratic postmodernist dictatorship of Russia, which pretends to be a country where your vote for the leader matters, and where the populace is flooded with conflicting information, misinformation, and disinformation, a \u201cfirehose of falsehoods\u201d which induces the \u201cvertigo of interpretation\u201d, where people don\u2019t know what to believe, people don\u2019t know what\u2019s true or false (Trump uses this same technique), which conveniently hides the rampant corruption of Putin and Russian oligarchs and the Russian Mafia and organized crime, a kleptocracy, rule by thieves (incidentally, the vory v zakone of the Russian Mafia means \u201cthieves in law\u201d, and that organized crime group originated in Soviet gulags, and the vor [Vyacheslav Ivankov](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Ivankov) lived in Trump Tower in the 90s.)\n\nA republic is \u201ca state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch. The word \u201crepublicanism\u201d is opposed to monarchism, having a king or emperor or tsar or Caesar or dictator (so it\u2019s ironic how modern Republicans seem to want Trump to be a tyrannical king, when America was founded by breaking away from and defeating a tyrannical king). Again, how are representatives elected? By democracy. If there is no democratic election to democratically elect representatives, then you can\u2019t have a representative democracy aka republic.\n\nWikipedia says:\n\n>A republic (from Latin res publica\u00a0'public affair') is a form of government in which \"supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives\". In republics, the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.\n\nA presidential republic is:\n\n>a form of government in which a head of government, typically with the title of president, leads an executive branch that is separate from the legislative branch in systems that use separation of powers. This head of government is in most cases also the head of state. In a presidential system, the head of government is directly or indirectly elected by the people and is not responsible to the legislature, and the legislature cannot dismiss the president except in extraordinary cases.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, the head of the US Executive Branch, Donald Trump, incited an assault on the entire Legislative Branch, hoping to remain in power, which are the actions of a tyrant or despot, a traitor to our constitutional, representative democracy, presidential republic.\n\nA democracy is \u201ca system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.\u201d\n\nWikipedia says:\n\n>Democracy\u2026is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation (\"direct democracy\"), or to choose governing officials to do so (\"representative democracy\"). Who is considered part of \"the people\" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries, but over time more and more of a democratic country's inhabitants have generally been included. Cornerstones of democracy include freedom of assembly, association, property rights, freedom of religion and speech, inclusiveness and equality, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\n\nThe word \u201cdemocracy\u201d means rule of the people (as in, \u201cwe the people\u201d, America is supposed to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people), as opposed to aristocracy, which means rule by the elite. Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca each argued that democracy is an illusion, which only disguises the reality of elite rule, like, say, a plutocracy, rule by the rich, or oligarchy, rule by the few (based on things like nobility, fame, wealth, education, or corporate, religious, political, or military control.) Many people say America is actually a plutocracy, because the rich have more influence over the Legislative Branch and the federal government than the people do. Plato argued that democracies tend to devolve into dictatorships.\n\nAlexander Hamilton said \u201cGovernment is frequently and aptly classed under two descriptions-a government of force, and a government of laws; the first is the definition of despotism-the last, of liberty.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is a convicted felon who doesn\u2019t abide by any laws, he rules by force, which is despotism according to Hamilton.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said \u201cPatriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.\u201d\n\nBut if the President himself is using The Anarchist Cookbook to torch the Constitution to wield unilateral power and authority, that\u2019s not in the name of liberty, that\u2019s in the pursuit of despotism, or fascism, or a dictatorship.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said \u201cTo announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\u201d",

This is basically the definition of a republic: a state that is \"owned\" collectively by/for the public instead of by one guy. (If the concept of ownership of a state seems weird, remember we're talking about ancient political theory here.) In contrast a democracy is a state that is actually ruled by the people.\n\nTechnically speaking, China is a republic, because it's not a monarchy.

Obviously the mechanism of the state and the mechanisms that protect liberty must be connected, so that is not to say that democracy is bad or that the system of governance doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it does, but it depends on the former, not the other way around. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what form of governance sufficiently empowers minorities to maintain individual liberties as part of a stable equilibrium, but it would be nice if there is one that is stable and still provides enough collective power to protect the sovereignty of its constituents.

Is it not to protect certain specified and unspecified rights from being infringed upon by the will of a democratic majority?\n\nThe Bill of Rights is therefore a recognition that democracy can lead to an infringement on rights and liberties and therefore, it must be curtailed.\n\nThe two are not necessarily at odds with one another at all times but if given the opportunity do you want it decided whether you can say and speak what you wish by others? Do you want it decided by others what means you use to protect your life? Do you want it decided by others when you should be afforded a trial by jury? I merely pulled these examples to illustrate the point.\n\nBecause I think we all know that there are for example strong indications that certain speech would be made illegal if various groups or political parties had their way on the question of speech.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bill of Rights did not extend itself to the protections of economic liberty and as a result, I contend the property and thus the individual rights of people are threatened by the will of the majority which would seek to engage in plunder and redistribute property.\n\nYou already get that to a limited degree but the only restriction against that is political rather than constitutional.
