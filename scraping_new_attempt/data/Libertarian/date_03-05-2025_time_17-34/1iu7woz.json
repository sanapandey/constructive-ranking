    "selftext": "\n::TAKE AWAY::\nWhat they claim the problem is:\n \u201cDangerously, retailers exploited the agriculture law to sell life-threatening, unregulated forms of THC to the public and made them easily accessible,\u201d Patrick said in a statement. \u201cThese stores not only sold to adults, but they targeted Texas children and exposed them to dangerous levels of THC\n\nWhat they are fighting:\nThe 2019 law that legalized hemp for agricultural purposes created a loophole, allowing the sale of low-THC products. This has led to a booming market, with more than 7,000 dispensaries and various cannabis products readily available. Critics, including Nico Richardson, CEO of Texas Original, argue, \u201cWe\u2019re getting slaughtered by a completely unregulated, intoxicating hemp industry,\u201d\n\nMy Stance\nIt's not our fault you didn't know as much about these flowers as we did. You can't take it back now that the wrong pockets are being lined. We all know the homies at the dispo ask for ID, and I have to be 21, and ain't nobody dying. If we are being real about it, Mr. CEO of a Government shill corporation & Mr. Lawmaker, man we have known about metals, pesticides, and mold since way back, and in 27 years of smoking, I've never heard of anything like the recalls the FDA puts out for things it calls \"safe\" with any weed. So, you can also keep your 10% tax as well as the level of involvement you have in the industry and we will keep our gummies and our quality standards. No one is falling for this obvious cash grab. Keep your exploitation to yourself. This isn't the 1930's and refer madness isn't going to work a second time. By now we all know better. No one is dying, and this industry's quality control through self-regulation puts the FDA to shame hands down. The fact that LtGov and his CEO partner (neither of which stand to profit from closing over 7,000 businesses and dealing a blow to Texas agriculture by being the only people allowed to sell weed in Texas I'm sure \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09) aren't even on the same page about THC in general one says they are \"low-level THC\" one says, \"dangerous levels of THC\" and neither of them seem to have any knowledge of the taxonomic biology of the plant itself. That's kinda scary js. I mean, if you want a thriving black market, go for it, but having people who hate the flower and know little to nothing about being in charge of the flower and excessive taxes have driven most LEGAL MARKETS to have thriving black markets. There are countless documentaries on YouTube where they discuss this with the people in those markets. THE LAW IS FINE THE WAY IT IS! Let's all meet up this 4/20 to show the world a Texas-sized smoke session and disprove this refer madness. #ProhibitionIsOver #JustFollowRegulations #RemainCompliant #EndReferMadness #DontBeingProhibitionBack #GreatTexasSmokeOut \n\nhttps://www.regulatoryoversight.com/2025/01/the-current-landscape-of-texas-cannabis-policy-and-laws-a-2025-overview/?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkQghleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHR18LMiCR7ymOTXJGTWpK4JFhpVmTBaAK5bq3M0mM7o0Prdu-yzki6MegQ_aem_4ahXslNEmJFwIybwLlfvsQ",
