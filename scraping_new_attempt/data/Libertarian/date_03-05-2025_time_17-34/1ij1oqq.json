He is pausing and/or stopping (right now it just appears stopping) congressionally apportioned money. Congress holds (or constitutionally should hold) the purse strings.\n\n- How is musk stopping/pausing these funds in the first place if he's merely advisory? Is he cutting costs or auditing? They should not be the same person doing both. If we wanted someone to audit departments, I don't disagree. Big however though: he's nor had the time or staffing to do a real audit of all the agencies he's torching. (Side note, if the R's were actually interested in audits and fiscal responsibility, why did we confirm a SecDef who ran two orgs into the ground and never performed an audit? Thats a big chunk of our budget that we could be better on audits and fiscal management.)\n\n- where is the transparency and reporting? Like at all? All Ive gotten is a list of alleged waste from R senators, framed to sound bad, from an agency specifically set up for foreign aid. Maybe its bad, maybe it isnt. But I have yet to see any audit or report (at all) published about all the big line items. Its important to review the bad, the good, and the mediocre all together. Oh, also not psyched about the white house straight up lying about one of those line items. Lying about 50 or 100 million in 'condoms to Gaza' is really not a good look if were claiming being transparent about financial breakdown.\n\n- He blew off conflict of interest as if thats no big deal, when it's a HUGE deal. He gets billions in government contracts.I'm sorry if I won't just take his word that he'll make the decision to recuse himself if he finds a conflict of interest. There should be oversight.\n\n- Probably more minor in relation, but not minor overall, did he actually have a TS before the Trump stsrted handing them out? Normally flouting the law (doing drugs on a podcast) and foreign contacts (Putin) are huge red flags. (I am a libertarian. Don't personally smoke weed. Do think it should be legal. It currently is not, federally. Following the rules when you want to work in government is important.) On top of that a TS doesnt flat out give you access to anything TS. You need a need to know for that specific thing. I'll grant that if has a clearance and (debatebly) the authority, you can argue need to know. But, compartmentilization of info is huge in terms of maintaining security, and we're doing the opposite of that by letting him access everything. Maybe it should be separate individuals in separate departments, etc.\n\n- Also relatively minor, but I absolutely hate the trend of calling things stupid names to show theyre bad. Sleepy Joe, Crooked Hillary, Green New Scam, Inflation Creation Act. If the thing is bad, argue that (and please do). Doing this name thing outside of a political cartoon just makes me thing you (the theoretical you) don't have an argument.\n\n- the bit at the end seemed completely non-sequiter about our base in the pacific. Not sure what that was about, other than to be performative.\n\nI'm totally for saving money and cutting FWA. 100%. But handing one man the keys to make decisions that flout the laws and budgets established by congress is 100% not the way. (Also, it's not fiscal responsibility to change the names of landmarks for no reason. Nor is it to abruptly shutter departments and buildings and lay people off. You have to build a plan, make a transition, and go about it methodically, if ONLY for fiscal responsibilty.)\n\nEdit: Typo",

Interesting to hear another libertarian say you got nothing out of that. \n\nIsn\u2019t elected or appointed simply a technicality at this point? Trump ran around with musk saying this is what he was going to do. I don\u2019t think DOGE is technically a department of the government. Trump talked about it on Rogan and essentially said he\u2019s trying to eliminate departments instead of creating more. DOGE has a lifespan and trump knows that any official department ever created has been historically hard to get rid of. \n\nHow can you say he wasn\u2019t appointed by the president to do what he\u2019s doing? The president says he\u2019s appointed to do it. You say he\u2019s not? \n\nMusk isn\u2019t the one that can press the pause button but the executive branch is doing whatever he wants anyways so that\u2019s another technicality. But technically speaking, Musk isn\u2019t the one pressing pause or freeze.\n\nIdk about the transparency and reporting. Kind of agree with you here but maybe it\u2019s coming. If it comes out would you be happy about it?\n\nThe conflict of interest part doesn\u2019t mean shit to me. He has the president in his pocket. How much more can he possibly benefit from seeing competitor information and such for spacex and Tesla? He probably could have just asked anyways, like it or not. Ya I can see how there could be some conflict of interest but that\u2019s the smallest price I could imagine paying for finding out what every department in the government is wasting their money on.\n\nI don\u2019t know this but I\u2019m guessing here. He had to have had a TS clearance prior. I work in the nuclear field and everyone has to have clearances. The main reason why is because it involves tech that the government is afraid of getting into the hands of other countries. The US would certainly require the same when spacex is innovating so rapidly. \n\nYa the part at the end was unrelated to anything and name calling is stupid but it\u2019s freedom of speech and I like to see it.",

And yes, it does matter.\n\nIf DOGE is not part of the government, that may be more worriesome. Is he a 'special government employee' or isn't he? Is he appointed or not? Both of these would mean he is part of the government, and thus his execution team would be as well.\n\nTrump should not get to eliminate departments. If he can eliminate them, the next pres can create them. Thats not a power I want the president to have.\n\nI mean, Musk has been acting like he's going to cut these departments and payments. If he's cutting them, thats a problem. If he's puppeting the exec office to cut them, that's one less problem, but still a problem.\n\nI reserve judgement until seeing reports, audits, and transparency. I would definitely be happy to see them. Hard to know if Id be happy about the actions until we the people can see the As-Is state and what Musks idea of a Should-Be state is. Not seeing them makes me very unhappy. Government should be transparent, excepting sometimes national security matters.\n\nConflict of interest should still matter. Having the president in his pocket is a problem. Adding another level of apathy about the possibility of corruption doesn't help. Maybe he does have our best interest at heart. Maybe. I have my doubts. But the matter of conflict of interest for someone who has billions in govt contracts is important and again, should be transparent at worst, nonexistent at best. (Jimmy carter, peanut farm, blah blah)\n\nWell, I believe he was an owner of spaceX when he smoked on Rogan. A past (disclosed) minor history of illegal drugs I believe is usually adjucated positively, not a huge deal. Doing illegal drugs while holding a clearance is grounds for revocation of that clearance and it wont be reissued. So if hes had it the whole time as a high level member/owner of SpaceX, thats even worse. (Like I said, I think it should be legal. But its not, and if he can't follow the rules for holding a clearance, why should I think he's following the rules now, esp with no oversight or transparency)\n\nNot going to bash freedom of speech. All for freedom of speech. However, opinion only, I think speech is best when its relevant and respectful. The base part was irrelevant and the names are disrespectful. Fully legally in the right, but doesnt contribute to a good conversation, which (again opinion only) is what I think is the only thing we should have our representives doing in an official capacity.",

The major difference between Libertarians and other political groups is that Libetarians hate the DMV no matter who is in charge. \n\nWhy?  \n\nBecause the DMV is a tool of oppression. It keeps poor people poor.  It keeps rich people rich. It violates your rights.  It causes wars. It kills people. \n\nAlso...  Robbing Peter to pay Paul isn't charity.  That is called welfare.  It is a useful tool for suppression and control.\n\nAnd the free market is the only reason you are not starving.  The free market is the only force on the planet that actually REDUCES poverty.  It is the only force that ever did.  The DMV uses poor people, and keeps them poor, to justify its existence.",

He throws his money around getting DAs elected who won't enforce the law and commit political prosecutions. Again, him being less wealthy than Musk is just a comment you are making to cover the fact that the left has had zero criticism for him throwing his money around to influence politics \n\nThe only power Musk has is the power to have access to the books of these agencies. All he can do is recommend.  The fact that the government can audit citizens at any time yet that same over sight being applied to them is considered extreme just shows how far off the cliff the bureaucratic mess has gotten. People are up in arms against Musk because he is pointing out the gross waste of our tax dollars, such as USAID. There is zero excuse for what they are wasting our money on.\n\nAs far as Blackrock is concerned, show me any substantial mainstream leftist criticism of their practices. They are cramming DEI, net zero, ESG, and LGBT agendas down the throats of corporations and, in turn, us.  There is no mainstream criticism of them or these unelected billionaires at the WEF creating policy.  It's only when one of those billionaires has an agenda not in line with theirs that they get concerned with unelected power. .",
