Not realizing that we don't care which side is \"better\" because they are both \"bad\".\n\ntl;dr we get heavily brigaded by shills.",

Pray for me.\n\nWhile I agree with some of the OP\u2019s original statements and your response is definitely at least part of the equation, I think we\u2019re ignoring the obvious on three points. 1) the idea that we don\u2019t\u201d fucking compromise\u201d is self-evidently not true. All of us violate our principles to just get along and live a life of peace. Not judging, not saying it\u2019s exactly the same as political compromise, but each of our daily interactions with the world give an impression of who we are. We cannot deny that fact. 2) the idea that our refusal to compromise will lead people to join us is just not supported by anything other than our own personal desire that it be so. Libertarians are, imho, only seen as a useful pawn/idiot to manipulate in election season. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any correlation between \u201cnot compromising\u201d and our success in elections. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I would love to see some evidence to the contrary. 3) the narcissism of small differences is alive and well in the libertarian movement. We all know it, and we\u2019ve all uttered those words \u201cnot a real libertarian\u201d. People can genuinely come to different conclusions with the same set of basic principles. Abortion is an excellent example. There are terrific libertarian defenses of multiple abortion positions that capture the nuance of the issue. I think there are people who seem like they\u2019re brigading who might just be missing an important point yet would agree with the libertarian consensus on almost anything else. For instance, libertarians that defend Israel without compromise are often unaware of the property rights foundation of the pro-Palestinian cause or are driven by religious conviction. I was personally \u201cconverted\u201d by the property rights argument because I never knew the real background story. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m an idiot or not a libertarian, it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have time to learn everything about everything, and we come preloaded with assumptions and presuppositions based on our education and formative years. \n\nNot really sure what point I\u2019m trying to make other than that maybe nuance and ignorance might explain seemingly insurmountable differences that hamstring our ability to be successful as a movement.",

It's certainly true that you can compromise one principle in order to buttress another one.  For instance, you can avoid a lot of squabbling if you simply pretend to agree with stuff you don't actually agree with.  \n\nBut it's not true that you can be less aggressive (i.e. live like a libertarian) by behaving aggressively (compromising the basic libertarian principle).\n\nI think the compromise idea comes up a lot in a different context.  Basically, the idea is that if I support a little aggression over here, I can avoid a lot of aggression over there. That basically amount to saying \"If I act less like a libertarian, then those people over there will act more like libertarians\".  The flaws in that kind of thinking should be self evident.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the post.  It made me think about things a bit.",

It was more that not all principles are worth dying for, and that\u2019s at least one explanation for the apparent variances in opinion and action amongst libertarians. People then see these variances and think that is incongruent with our stated beliefs. Therefore, outsiders don\u2019t see us as uncompromising as we would believe.  Of course, most Americans have no idea what libertarians actually think, but that\u2019s something else entirely. \n\nSeparately, I\u2019m not sure it is a good thing to be seen as wholly uncompromising\u2014leaving aside the obvious non-negotiable precepts like non-aggression and the importance of consent.

How about if I simply do nothing since that does make things easier for them than if I actively opposed them?\n\nOr maybe a better analogy: If I pay the mob enforcer who promises not to burn my shop to the ground as long as I keep my payments up, then I am engaging in aggression?  \n\nAggression happens as an act of volition meant to alienate someone from their legitimate rights. Volition can only happen in the absence of compulsion or aggression.  Otherwise you can never know if the choice is the product of the person or of the compulsion.

But even then, someone who is engaging in aggression is benefitting down the lane.  \n\nWe are looking for a good operational definition of \"aggressive behavior\". If it has to include offering any sort of support to anyone that is ever aggressive, the definition loses its utility.  I think one way of tightening things up is to exclude \"support under duress\" since the same person would make a different decision absent the duress.\n\nBut, I think we've beat this into the ground, so I will leave it there.

While that seems obvious, it's also fascinating. The more deeply someone believes something, the harder it is for them to change their beliefs, even when presented with evidence to the contrary. The depth of it varies from person to person, but it exists in all of us. \n\nSo much of the US deeply believes in Trump.

Does it start when it develops a certain amount of organs?\nDoes it start at a certain amount of months? Does it start as soon as it is pushed out?\n\nThe biggest question is when does it officially become a person and have it\u2019s own rights? What exact moment is it no longer considered just a clump of cells or a fertilized egg. Then once we determine that, then that will change other things as well like if killing a pregnant woman is a double homicide or not. People can\u2019t agree on that. Not all pro-life people think exactly the same when it comes to abortion. Even people in favor of abortion can\u2019t agree. There are pro choice that say there eventually should be a limit and some say no limit at all up to the exact moment of birth. It\u2019s complicated because we aren\u2019t talking about a chair or a dog. We are talking about live human offspring that progresses in value over time.

There is more than just reasonable doubt here, it\u2019s a patent absurdity to the vast majority of secular thought.\n\nFurthermore the collective judgement of secular society, as carried out by its official arbiters observably rejects the notion that the destruction of a single cell is the same thing as the capital crime of murder.  Any attempt to classify it as such can be observed to be driven by a minority which is mostly composed of religious authoritarians.\n\nEven killing an adult human has a dozen sub-categories based on perceived intent and circumstances.  So murder is murder, manslaughter is manslaughter, miscarriage is miscarriage, and abortion is abortion.\n\nWhat you are doing is not reasoning.  It is rationalizing.  Hollow semantic reductionism.  That is not how human legal frameworks are structured in general.  Semantic parsing is non-deterministic, and requires judges to interpret.\n\nAnd the argument you are rationalizing came first from religious authoritarianism before it started wearing a libertarian fig leaf as society became more secular.\n\nMore generally, if you are forcing ostensibly \u201clibertarian\u201d views on the general public against their will, then you\u2019re actually an authoritarian in disguise.",

Hell even petty crime denies you citizenship in a good portion of the world for that matter.  If they are crossing without border control that\u2019s not happening.  In more general terms though our hospital systems and public services are stretched dealing with what we have here legally.  Hospital ER\u2019s are not a doctors office.  That really happens.  Those are two facts.  Dissecting the other republicans talking points is harder.  I don\u2019t know if I believe them all or not.  Do illegal immigrants skew representation in Congress?  They might.  I\u2019m leaning towards yes it does.  California probably should have lost an additional congressional seat.  Not 100% sure though.  Another is educational spending.  I worked edu for decades and a whole lot of money is spent on those kids somehow or other.  Plenty of other arguments are put forth.  I won\u2019t dissect them all because again many may not be true.  The citizenship argument is also a big one.  Anchor babies are a thing.  Harder to evict the parents in court due to family hardship of separating a family.  \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I am not heartless.
