If you want to consume, is your problem only, you pay for your healthcare, and you don't cause problems to anyone else.\n\nNow let's take this to real life. Let's say Argentina, where I live as many proposed South American countries. In Argentina, unfortunately, we have an inefficient state healthcare system. If we legalize drugs, more people would consume them and also consume more of the health care system that is financed via taxes. So, until Health Care is 100% privately owned, and the state has 0% intervention there, drugs should be illegal as it's a cost to the health care system we all pay. Also a cost to the social systems we have in Argentina, etc, etc.\n\nYou could argue that programs combating drug cartels are more expensive, but, I doubt that. State Healthcare expenditure in Argentina represents around 10% of its GDP, meanwhile, military expenditure is less than 0.5% of GDP. Healthcare values would increase given free access to drugs.\n\nTLDR: in a minarchist government without state healthcare, for sure, yes to drugs. In the real world where the state still has healthcare, no, as people who don't consume drugs need to pay for those who do.\n\nEDIT: Adding a video from Milei that summarizes my position (\u00a0[https://youtu.be/giEcsRDosKM?t=783](https://youtu.be/giEcsRDosKM?t=783)) it's in Spanish but auto-translate is available. Please watch it and let me know what you guys think. Thanks!",
