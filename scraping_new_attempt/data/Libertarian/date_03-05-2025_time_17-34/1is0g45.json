And there's a fair bit of science on the topic.\n\nWhile bison are believed to have produced an equivalent amount of methane as cattle with everything else being equal (see [here](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/961/2021/bg-18-961-2021.pdf)), the actual amount of historical production is much less (see [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1502547112)). There's several factors involved, including the difference in diet between wild grasslands vs feeding with grain crops.\n\nAlso, the statement about numbers is...blatantly wrong. I notice you specified \"dairy cows\". Is that to purposefully leave out the much larger amount of cattle that aren't dairy cows? Because the actual amount of cattle in total in the US today is 2 to 3 times more than the amount of bison at their peak.",

The type of trees being planted and the ages of the trees matter. \n\nSince different tree species sequester different amounts of carbon and if you're replacing a bunch of forested areas with paper mill trees, that could result in an overall reduction in carbon sequestration, despite having more trees overall (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01336-4) for an example study, but there's plenty of different ones on that particular topic).\n\nAs for tree ages, it's a tradeoff. Younger trees grow faster and so, in the short term, will capture more carbon. Older trees more efficiently sequester carbon overall and so are better for long term impacts. Both have their uses in different situations. But, overall, reducing the amount of older trees is generally bad for long term outcomes.",

I know for instance there\u2019s 1/10 the amount of elk in the USA compared to pre colonization.\n\nIt sounds like Mule deer got hit super hard too, and I\u2019m very sure the same is true for tons of other wild species. \n\nSo again, not trying to be a jerk or anything, but it seems like there are just simply enormously less large animals in North America now. Especially large mammals.",

Used to be closer to 100 million. \n\nGood point on the other animals. Which more strongly confirms the point of the second scientific paper I linked above. Despite the massacre of the bison and all the other animals you mentioned in a short period of time, the resulting reduction in methane production from that loss was only 3.3%. So their overall contribution to the overall methane amounts was much smaller than current livestock.",
