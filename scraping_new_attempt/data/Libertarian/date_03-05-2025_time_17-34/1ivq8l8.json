So many of the lines are going clear around the board when it could just be moved closer. Looks like the erd diagrams people were making in my college dba classes.",

Would regulations have prevented the 2008 financial crisis? Maybe, but we should have just let the banks failed and bailed out Americans only. \n\nOf course libertarians are against the medical-industrial complex which was created because of government. The patent extensions loophole and patents lasting this long is directly opposed to capitalism. The fact that hospitals are allowed to price gouge cost for their medical equipment because they know insurance is willing to pay for it is opposed to capitalism as well. Finally, what kind of free market allows hospitals to have opaque prices, and not allow you to see how much each item cost?",
