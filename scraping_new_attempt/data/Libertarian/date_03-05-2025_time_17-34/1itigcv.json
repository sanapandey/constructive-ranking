A legal system where judges are paid well enough to not be bribed seems necessary for a free market economy. As such, sales taxes seem the least onerous way to provide the money to pay for such a legal system.\n\nNow, if the anarcho capitalists want on this subreddit want to disagree with me, I'm all ears.",

Thus the consumer buying a leather jacket is not paying for the taxes paid by the manufacturers, the the farmers, the designers, etc. Furthermore, it included credits so the poorest families paid very little to nothing in tax to survive while the rich would necessarily pay significantly more (making the democrats happy), while tourists and immigrants would also be paying taxes on some items (making republicans happy).",
