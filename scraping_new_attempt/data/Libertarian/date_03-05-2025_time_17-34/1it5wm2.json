In her speech she was talking about how it would have a bunch of benefits, etc. and that she thought that Republicans had manufactured a bunch of fake controversies about it (i.e. the \"death panels\") over the past several months.\n\nSo she said \"But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, **away from the fog of the controversy**\". That last part of her sentence is always left out when people quote it.\n\nBasically it was her saying that Obama Care had a bunch of sick benefits that people would realize once the bill passed and they got to see it in action. \n\nIn 2012, she added more context in an interview with the Washington Post - that at that point, the bill had been debated for months, and that the House was waiting for the Senate to pass a version of Obamacare - and so people were still waiting for the specifics of the Senate version. So she was apparently also saying that the Senate needed to pass a version of it before people should tear it apart.\n\nNot sure I agree with her about how great Obama Care was overall, but it was clear what she meant.",
