There should be zero tolerance for wannabe brownshirt students getting violent at protests or shutting down spaces at public universities. \n\nThis idea that pro-Palestine voices have suffered discrimination at American universities is Looney Tunes. Expressing any viewpoint about the Middle East generally and Palestine specifically, other than \"Muh colonialism\" at a university, is a full-on permission structure for cancellation and violence. The legality of Trump's order is nebulous. Rights that exist based on the \"spiritual\" reading of the Constitution are always one hearing away from flipping. However, the real attack on free speech is from the Left, but unsurprisingly, the author of the article doesn't even engage with that.",
