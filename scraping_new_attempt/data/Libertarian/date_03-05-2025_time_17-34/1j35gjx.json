Sorry getting dressed for work \ud83d\ude05  lol\n\nThere are a few policy areas from President Trump's tenure that some libertarians have pointed to as aligning with their emphasis on limited government and free markets. For example:\n\n\u2022 Deregulation Efforts: His administration\u2019s push to cut back on federal regulations in various industries was seen by some as reducing government overreach\u2014a key libertarian principle.\n\n\u2022 Tax Reform: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered corporate and individual tax rates, has been praised by libertarians who favor minimal government intervention in the economy.\n\n\u2022 Criminal Justice Reform: Initiatives like the First Step Act, aimed at reducing mandatory minimum sentences and reforming the criminal justice system, have also been highlighted by some libertarians as steps toward curtailing excessive government power.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that libertarian thought is diverse. While some of these actions resonate with libertarian values, other policies\u2014such as his stances on immigration, trade protectionism, or certain foreign policy decisions\u2014often conflict with the broader libertarian emphasis on free movement, non-intervention, and open markets.",
