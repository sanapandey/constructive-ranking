Maybe something like: \"We need fascism to save the West so we can have Libertarianism in the future.\"\n\nDoesn't make sense, but that's what I used to think over half a decade ago, so I understand the sentiment. If that is the case, u/Any_Respond_3170 just has to learn more on Anarcho Capitalism why Fascism isn't needed. If you're reading me dude, check out LiquidZulu or MentisWave on YouTube.",

Its a completely fine thing to be an ethnonationalist libertarian due to covenant communities and freedom of association. Fascistic libertarianism is impossible because it requires the state to indirectly or directly control all businesses its a form of socialism to say the least.",
