As gatekeep-ey as libertarians have a reputation for being (let's be honest, there's kind of a reason for that), libertarianism probably encompasses a broader range of stances on different issues than any other political school of thought out there, and in my eyes, that's the beauty of it. Keep it simple: don't hurt people, don't touch their stuff, think for yourself, and be a responsible person. I think that's a pretty attractive message that resonates with a lot of people, and if we just emphasized it a little more, as opposed to trying to narrow the spectrum of what we allow ourselves to be aligned with to such a stringent degree, I think a lot more people would get on board with it.

So while finding out where personhood starts is exceptionally difficult, this statement is still moral.\n\n>I support Zero deficit spending.

Someone having a different political opinion on an issue is how improvements get made. Oftentimes, the best changes in history start off with an unpopular opinion.

The whole religion example you have is lost to me unless you realize that we\u2019re not talking about religion, I was talking about human rights. Human rights are not a religion nor do we call anything dogma for referring to human rights. If AOC is okay with violating one human right but takes a stand on a different one, I\u2019m not going to see her as credible. Human rights are actually nonpartisan issues too. With Harris, I saw her take a stand for victims of sex offer sets. That\u2019s awesome. However, I saw her label trump as a felon which he IS but she never thought about how that stigmatizes all ppl with records which isn\u2019t good for the rights of people with lived experience in the criminal Justice system. And anyone tough on crime but not talking about re-entry programming makes me feel kind of unsafe. Because without re-entry we have increased recidivism. So for this example, it actually comes full circle- protecting victims of violent crimes \u00a0means better re-entry. It also means criminal Justice reform. I mean it means a lot of things that need fixing but one thing we know is we aren\u2019t able to improve society without protecting human rights in the criminal Justice system which includes far more than violent rapists (like trump and which re-entry for is the most taboo subject in prison reform so obviously it\u2019s not an easy one to discuss but it was on my mind during her campaign). I hope that helps it make sense that I would hold her to that standard.\u00a0",
