                            "body": "The Federal Reserve system was created in 1913.  The major stock market crash that signaled the beginning of \"the great depression\" was in 1929. \n\nIn 1933 private citizens owning gold was effectively made illegal.  It was up to 10 years in prison unless you surrendered your gold to the Federal Reserve in exchange for paper money. \n\nAs noted other places they immediately began inflating money. \n\nAs a result of \"The New Deal\" corporatist plan and money inflation \"the great depression\" lasted until after WW2 when a lot of the government policies were rolled back. \n\nIt is also worth noting that USA \"General Corporations\" (ie: general business corporations) did not, in fact, exist until after 1899.  This was when Delaware passed their Delaware General Corporation Law.  Prior to that business corporations had a limited life span, had a specific purpose, and required legislation to be passed.  After 1900 business corporations have infinite life span, have no specific purpose other then to make money for investors, and only required filling out the right paper work and constructing the right corporate governance. \n\nSo it wasn't long before publicly traded corporations, widespread use of the stock market, and Federal Reserve and such things actually started existed as a common thing before the whole nonsense collapsed. \n\nWe are talking about 13-29 years here. \n\nEver since then it required continuous legal updates and policy changes and interventions on behalf of the banking cartels (aka Federal Reserve) and Federal regulators to keep the whole thing afloat. \n\nWhich means that when you get beyond small and medium businesses and start getting into higher finance, big national corporations, and such things...  There is very little actual free market involved.  It took massive efforts in government to create and maintain all of this.\n\nBailing the current system out was what happened with in 1933 when they made owning gold illegal.  It is what happened in 2008 with the massive bailouts to the banks for causing the housing crisis.  It happened again in 2020 when they 'printed' trillions of dollars to bail out the stock market and keep prices high. \n\nand if you ever hear somebody say that \"The USA has never defaulted on its debt\"...  They are full of shit.  There has been 3 or 4 times the Federal government defaulted on Debt.  \n\nOne of the major examples of USA defaulting on its debt A; was when Nixon formally abandoned the gold standard in 1971. \n\n\nAll of this shit ties together... The great depression, the rise of the administrative state, the creation of corporatist economic and legal systems, the abandoning of the gold standard.\n\nThis is also why the idea that we need to have the Federal government or big government to counter act the greed and short citedness of big corporations is pure nonsense. \n\nCentral Banking and big Centralized governments don't counter act the greed of these big corporations.  They don't exist to protect the people from greedy billionaires.  They protect the greedy billionaires from the people. Big government exists to help facilitate the creation of big business corporations. \n\n And the curse of modern times isn't corporate influence over government... It is the government working with these corporations to have influence over markets and undermine individual liberty.",

With money today, we don\u2019t have to rely on gold. It\u2019s more flexible, so if there\u2019s a problem, we can fix it faster, like adding more money or adjusting things when needed.
