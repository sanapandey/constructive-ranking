If Sanders saved $10,000 a year for 50 years at an 8% compound annual growth rate, he would currently have over $6,200,000. Therefore, it's not far fetched to believe Senator Sanders is secretly worth over $5 million\"\n\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/bernie-sanders-net-worth-is-extremely-high-for-a-democratic-socialist/",

Bernie spent the majority of his political career as a non millionaire and only recently in the past few years become a millionaire after signing lucrative book deals since he's gained traction as being one of if not the most consistent politician when it comes to fighting for the American people. What's up with all these fake Libertarians that are really Republicans/ conservatives but embarrassed to claim their party bashing Bernie in this sub so much recently ? Fox News must be pushing an anti Bernie Sanders campaign these past couple of days lol since he's been calling out how the government is turning into an oligarchy and how since in the past few weeks Musk, Bezos, and Zuchenberg have made a few billion.",
