They funnel this aid via NGOs that have noble-sounding goals, for the express purpose of shielding them from criticism and/or challenges to their funding. \n\nThis is the [classic progressive move](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy)\\--aggressively push for your political, but have a some soppy cover story ready to cover your ass. \n\nAs specific example is the National Low Income Housing Coalition And Low Income Housing (NLIHC). On its face, this sounds like a charity, right? Well, take a look at their 990. In field 4a, they're supposed to list the three biggest tasks/projects they did, in terms of expenses. They list... phone calls.  \n\n    \n1) They \"helped state and local governments\" to spend federal money\n\n    \n2) They created 8 \"publications\", which are basically pamphlets [like this one](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/eviction-record-sealing-and-expungement-toolkit%20(1).pdf) which 13 pages long (including a cover page, index page, and another cover page at the end).\n\n    \nThe rest is literally webinars and meetings. \n\nThis organization got paid many millions of taxpayer dollars. They pay their CEO 400K. They employ 40 other people.  \n  \nBut the organization doesn't actually **do anything** other than serve as a medium through which progressive patronage can flow from the federal government to progressive activists.\n\nAnd make no mistake--the people who run these things are activists first and foremost. Guess who progressive journalists call when they need [a scary-sounding quote about budget cuts](https://archive.is/eIps4#selection-1261.0-1265.340)? Why, their bought-and-paid-for henchman--the CEO of the NIHLC!\n\n>\u201cThis order is a potential five-alarm fire for nonprofit organizations and the people and communities they serve,\u201d Diane Yentel, the chief executive of the National Council of Nonprofits, said in a statement.\u201cFrom pausing research on cures for childhood cancer to halting food assistance, safety from domestic violence and closing suicide hotlines, the impact of even a short pause in funding could be devastating and cost lives,\u201d she added. \u201cThis order could decimate thousands of organizations and leave neighbors without the services they need.\u201d\n\nYou can imagine what progs would say if this organization were defunded. Republicans want the homeless to suffer! Yet, as we have seen, eliminating the organization would only harm progressive activists, not the people who are nominally the beneficiaries of the organization. \n\nKeep this in mind when you see the media attacking Elon's cuts.",
