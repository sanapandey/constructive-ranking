When you consider the *actual mechanism* by which you would *know* what you are being told, you realize you have to simply *believe* something, or accept that you don\u2019t know. Neither of these is considered acceptable, so we create narratives based on our preferred dogma.\n\nIntuitively, we all know that government had gotten out of control with an immense amount of corruption, fraud, and waste.\n\nIntuitively, we all know the current administration is violating existing, long-established law.\n\nIntuitively, we all know that both political parties and most or all politicians are not straight forward, have ulterior motives, and are generally corrupt. That what they say is either a blatant lie or carefully spun.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Not in a great spot. Our preferred dogma gives us a more comfortable narrative.",

Otherwise it\u2019s just hurting people and making us look bad to our allies. I think there should be zero subsidies, bailouts, and handouts to corporations and businesses because it\u2019s whats turned corporations into monsters and gave us a marrying of corporations and state. It\u2019s allowed for essentially a plutocracy to rise and Elon is just contributing to it. Why should my tax dollars pay for his 30 BILLION in contracts? He doesn\u2019t deserve my money. And at the same time he cuts things that are for the common American like social security- which yeah it\u2019s gotta go eventually and I\u2019m not gonna see a payout when I get to retirement, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s giving me and everyone else who paid in so far a refund for what has been taken from us to fund SSI. It isn\u2019t going to save us money because those funds are being taken and reallocated into the pockets of him and his rich friends. We should be getting that money BACK.

In good seasons however, rather than that excess going to waste, it may be given away or sold cheap abroad to either service a foreign interest arrangement or offset the cost of the subsidy investment directly.\n\nYou could eliminate those subsidies, but the likely result will be that most or all small farms either become unsustainable and get shut down, or have to shrink drastically in a matter of a few years and their land rolled up into the likes of Monsanto, who then would wield their unchecked monopoly to raise prices on goods that you can no longer get from anyone else in your region. You might say that the ideal result is that more small farms would simply emerge across the country to support the local communities that they exist in, and that may well be the result, but it would limit affordable selection, introduce a degree of food uncertainty, and in general - most people don't really want to live in close proximity to farm land - sounds/smells/chemicals etc\n\nYou might also say that farmers should just directly profit from that mandated excess instead - the problem there is that the subsidy really would become a welfare program.\n\nTldr is - farms are more complicated than just simple market dynamics, and also represent critical infrastructure and have relevance to national security - it makes at least some sense for the government to be staked in them.\n\nWhat probably should happen is that the subsidies continue to exist, but are counter balanced more efficiently and effectively in the usage of excess production, and perhaps the size of those subsidies and their related production gets curtailed to better align with actual US need potential.",

                    "body": "Assuming it's legally authorized and appropriated by Congress I agree with your sentence. Where things get stickier is that the responsibility isn't merely to send the aid, it's to ensure it is for the purpose it was authorized and appropriated for, which means there is not only a concomitant responsibility to ensure it is being given only to third parties for disbursement/use that are properly vetted and monitored for compliance but to also make all efforts to maximize the efficient use of the aid for the legal purpose.  I'm not saying that administrative agency personnel never work to these standards and I think that instances meeting the legal definition of fraud - while they clearly have occurred in the past - are the exception and not the rule.  I also think Congress has often failed in its constitutional duties by not authoring sufficiently considered and specific legislation, delegating entirely too much of what amounts to legislative authority to the executive, and not providing sufficient oversight (beyond political dog and pony shows).  Nor is a president blameless if they seek to undermine agency inspector generals or deprive them of resources.  I believe there's a reason why we almost always hear the words \"waste\" \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" in conjunction in this context: the lines between them aren't necessarily particularly bright.  But I also believe that, regardless of whether something meets the legal definition of criminal fraud, Congress and both the federal agencies and the contracts/grants officers they employ to award and dispurse aid have a legal fiduciary duty to the taxpayers regarding those public funds, who they are given to, for what purpose, and to maximize their impact for such legal purpose.\n\nI think a lot of people have a surface-level notion of foreign aid as U.S. federal agency employees being in-country handing out emergency rations, barrels of crop seeds, medicine, and water or directly assisting in the development of such resources and construction of the required infrastructure for the direct assistance of impacted individuals in these foreign countries.  The reality is that the vast majority of U.S. foreign aid is in the form of disbursements of taxpayer funds to the foreign government or a third party organization like a non-profit, a research or medical institution, NGO, etc. This is almost always the failure point in which waste/fraud/abuse occurs.  It's not about a bunch of U.S. federal agency contracts/grants officers getting kickbacks but rather whether they, their bosses, the agencies that employ them, and members of the executive and congressional branches responsible for oversight are fulfilling their duties to be proper stewards of the funds, where they go, and to their proper and most efficient use.  If they fail in that duty there should be consequences, including elimination of such funding until the house gets in order.  Best corollary I can think of is the fiduciary duty a privately practicing attorney has to their client and the clients money.  If that attorney were to even commingle client and firm funds they'd be censured and if they used client funds for any purpose other than for the client's benefit or a client-authorized purpose they'd likely be disbarred and, depending upon the circumstances, potentially subject to criminal investigation and prosecution for embezzlement and fraud.  As it's said, \"weird facts make for weird cases\" so there will always be exceptions to the rule but generally speaking an attorney can't really duck this fiduciary responsibility and the consequences for a breach by outsourcing the management of money to someone else either and their duty certainly includes properly vetting who they are delegating the responsibility to and monitoring how that party is exercising the responsibility so delegated.\n\nNow I will exercise my duty to publicly apologize for what I'm sure was a rambling and likely incoherent post. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
