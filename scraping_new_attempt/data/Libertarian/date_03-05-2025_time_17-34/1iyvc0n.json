That pendulum is gonna swing the other way, and they could realistically \"Weekend at Biden's\" another geriatric president with zero coverage of the signs",

The WHCA was openly hostile to the Trump admin in his 4 years, and ran cover for Biden in his 4 years (covering up his mental decline quickly comes to mind). I don't see how this could be any worse, than a left-controlled WHCA made up of a majority left-leaning news organizations.",

I think the gov shouldn't be allowed to pick and choose what journalists get to cover them, as they're (meant to be) public servants, and we have a right to know what they're up to",

Journalistic integrity is long gone, so should the long history of giving the press corp the gatekeeper rights to the white house press briefings. \n\nMost mainstream news sources, on all sides of the issues, have become more like tabloids.  More concerned about being the first to break news and bending it to fit whatever agenda their readers desire.",

We can acknowledge the white house press corps and the legacy outlets they enabled were total shit while also realizing that the admin handpicking which outlets get to have the closest access is probably also not good. \n\nWould we really be in a better and more honest media environment if the daily wire, breitbart, OAN, and fox are the only ones allowed in?\n\nThe best/fairest system would probably be some kind of lottery",
