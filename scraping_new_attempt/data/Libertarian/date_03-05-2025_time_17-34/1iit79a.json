Oct 7th was in response to decades of Israel tightening borders and controls over the strip. To the level that Israel wouldn\u2019t let them import things like coriander and turned off the electricity for no reason. \nAlso your comment assumes that Hamas was at fault for the peace discussions not panning out, we now know that the ceasefire in place now was signed by Hamas 13 months ago. Israel refused to sign because they thought they\u2019d win. \nPalestinians in general have not changed their demands for peace, and Israel, as the wielder of the bigger stick (courtesy of the US bailing them out) is the one that is unwilling to negotiate fairly because why would they when daddy warbucks will give them whatever they need for defence. \nThe only viable solution is a single, secular state where all people have the same rights.

No one, and I mean no one, wants to take in 2 million Gaza refugees. Egypt, to very little international attention, has been far more militant about a no-go zone in their border with Gaza than Israel ever has. When Palestinians went to other Arab countries it resulted in immense upheaval and violence. So there's literally no where to put these refugees. \n\n2. The vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza will refuse to be relocated. \n\n3. Trump will not order the US military to forcibly round out and deport 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and take them to... where? Lets say that Trump actually tried to order this and decided to create a holding bay in Syria, then you'd actually see Congress get involved. Trump's control of Congress is razor thin. Even a couple defections would doom his initiatives.  \n\n4. There's no evidence that there is a wealth of visitors willing to sink trillions of dollars into Gaza, particularly with the US government somehow still owning?\n\n5. And this one is the most important. Trump is not a serious person. He just throws ideas out and expects other people to make it work, or just abandons it if there's sufficient backlash. His track-record of doing things that couldn't be done by executive order, or outsourced to another group, is remarkably thin.",

In 1948, Israel was established on that legitimately acquired land. Therefore, Israel is a legitimate state.\n\nThe Gaza Strip belonged to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan. Those countries attacked Israel and thus lost that land. Under international law it is now Israeli property. The UN claim that it should be allocated to the Palestinians for a 2-state solution is nonsense, because the Palestinians were only lessees, not landowners.\n\nThis war will be over once the Palestinians release the Israeli hostages and hand over the October 7 terrorists to the ICC in The Hague to be tried for their crimes. The Palestinians themselves have chosen to risk the lives of their children. They could have lived in their home country Jordan for years and given their children a good future. Instead, they choose to fight Israel in Iran's proxy war. Palestinian citizens support Hamas verbally, with recruitment and with their tax money. How immoral do you want it to be?",

I don't think the Gazan's will agree to it because it inflames anti-colonialist sentiment within the populace. But you never know, and they could opt for safety over sovereignty.",
