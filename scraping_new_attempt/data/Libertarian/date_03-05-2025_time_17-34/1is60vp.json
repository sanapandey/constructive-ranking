And the dictator has to centralize power **at the federal level** to bash anyone who opposes.\n\nHow is dismantling power at the federal level and pushing it out to the 50 states fascist? I'm 100% on-board with getting rid of a central government that could become fascist someday, as opposed to 50 independent states, with competing ideas for success.",

So get rid of the pork at federal level and send some of that savings to the states to fund their programs.\n\nDismantling programs and sending responsibility back to the states (both red and blue ones) is not how fascists consolidate power. If he were a fascist, he would be doing the opposite: dismantling state programs and moving all of the power to the federal government.",

Apparently he didn't look up the definition of what a fascist was before he called Trump a fascist. As I said in a previous comment, Trump **WOULD** be a fascist if he were dismantling programs at the local and state levels and consolidating that power under his control at the federal level. But that is not what is happening.\n\nAlso, he is not going to come back with any proof that Trump is hiring any new people to replace those let go. All that has been done thus far is the same thing that every president before and after him does... you delegate the execution of your policies to people who can achieve that.",
