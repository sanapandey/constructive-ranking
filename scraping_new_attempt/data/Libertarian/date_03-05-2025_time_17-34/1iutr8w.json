The answer is not to remove government. Big businesses want that as well, as it means nothing will get in their way. The issue we have is corruption, with a huge part of that coming from a supreme court ruling essentially legalizing bribery. What we need is money out of politics and a proper check on that.\n\nBusinesses don't need the government to root out their competition. They have a wealth of options that scales with how big the business already is, especially buying up competition and establishing trusts. Hence anti-trust legislation that was not being enforced until Lina Khan headed up the FTC. She's gone with the new administration.\n\nGovernment can absolutely become a monopoly, but that's only if it is no longer responsive to the people.

My biggest gripe with the Right is their incessant lapdogging for Israel without even being aware that they\u2019re being unbelievably hypocritical in their critiques regarding the violence and that Israel and its agents have been funding and fueling both sides of issues forever, monumentally increasing governmental bloat and political strife.\n\nI imagine it\u2019s primarily due to the fact that the Right is largely Christian (not that that makes any sense, buts that\u2019s a whole other rant) and more elderly, so they were brainwashed with pre-internet propaganda for decades that they just dig their heels into. Optimistically, though, studies show that younger folks on both sides of the aisle are growing increasingly disillusioned with Israel in this new age of mass information, so I think we\u2019ll see a big shift there in the not-so-distant future.",
