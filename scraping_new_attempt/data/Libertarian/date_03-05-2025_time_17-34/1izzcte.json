Going  to DC and getting all this attention and dinner and, etc etc. Is intensely flattering. And these people can make money from the attention they get, since it will boost their views and marketability.  \n\n\nStick: \n\nIf you piss us off we can take this away from you so you won't get invited to the next club meeting and you won't get advanced access to important information.\n\n(ie:  Just in case you don't understand how this works: \"influencers\" get paid to post messages.  Some of them can make a lot of money from it. More then they can make from just getting views.  Like tens of thousands of dollars or more to post certain views on certain subjects at certain times.  This way astroturf campaigns can be made to look organic. The more attention they get the more money they can command for these services.  They also coordinate through platforms like discord and share viewers with one another to boost \"engagement\". Which is why a lot of right-wing grifters got their blue checkmarks taken away in the last \"Vivek things you are lazy and stupid but H1B immigrants are better\" fake outrage campaign on twitter... they got caught doing this)\n\n\nThis is exactly some of the same tactics that is used to control the press, although in comparison this is pretty heavy handed and clumsy. \n\nPiss off \"The Party\" and you lose your \"inside connections\", no longer get invited to events, and no longer can report on \"leaked\" information, etc etc.",
