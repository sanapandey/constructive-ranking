At the very least it would be downplayed to hell and they\u2019d lose a drop in the bucket of their profits in fines/settlements but certainly no criminal charges. Your proposal only works in a free market without corporate overlords owning everything and being infinitely wealthy. If you want to undo that damage then some serious trust busts need to happen because the market is only this way because of the fed subsidizing and giving tax cuts to the big players and making legislation that favors profits as long as they get a cut, which they do. This is cronyism at its worst and will never be corrected with the amount of corruption in the government- and it\u2019s only going to get worse.
