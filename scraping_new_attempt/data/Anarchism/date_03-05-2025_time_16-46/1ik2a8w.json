    "selftext": "Much of Anarchism as a social movement revolves around non-governmental mutual aid and other non-political support organizations. But if any given Anarchist sought to enter government with the intention to bring about at least some minor change how would they go about that?\n\nAt least for me, who does not like labels but would best be defined as an individualist anarchist \u2014 in which anarchism is a way of life that I personally hold myself to \u2014 I do not engage in the civic aspects of government, i.e. I do not vote because I believe it to be amoral. I am often critical of the possibility of actually effecting any real change through government, because it is the enemy after all. But I have considered after law school, I start next autumn, pursuing politics with the idea of at least keeping other politicians in check lol. But do not know how this would even work.\n\n1. Would an Anarchist openly declare themselves as such, putting themselves at odds with the status quo and likely reducing the odds of being elected?\n\n2. Would an Anarchist be better served by \u201cplaying the game\u201d with an intent to reach higher offices in hopes of bringing about change more effectively?\n\n3. Or would an Anarchist just best be served by staying out of politics and just focusing on what they can do personally to bring about social change?\n\nInterested in hearing you all\u2019s opinions and comments!",

However, this is the system as-is, and if you're willing to lose to stay principled, then I don't see why it would be somehow philosophically disallowed.\n\nIf you want to make Anarchism less scary to people, then announcing yourself as an anarcho-something makes sense. Even if you lose (and you almost certainly will) you have the opportunity to get some people to think a little more deeply, maybe start some conversations. \n\nIf you want to win and affect policy, you'll probably need to hide your affinity and play the game, but then you're structurally limited in what you \"can\" do because the rules of the game work that way. That makes you someone more like a Bernie or an AOC, and you'll get called a sellout, which might be fine--devoting yourself to the machinery of the Orphan Crushing Machine is not great a*narchist praxis* per say, but if you find it possible to degrade the machine's operation and you're having more of an impact doing this than something else then it's not like we can ask you to hand on your anarchist membership card.\n\nIt's not going to pass a purity test, but if this is something you're good at, then do it, especially if you learn useful things and help communities engage better with this process, etc. The machine will keep operating either way. If you can do this AND be of value to a community, sure. Especially if the alternative is, like, working at the Business Factory. If it's this, or a life of community organizing, I think I'd love a good community organizer more than a \"corporate democrat\" who has to hide his leftism for 30 years and never get to do anything.\n\nLike, I don't want to tell all anarchists to become *lawyers* but I am glad some lawyers are anarchists, right?\n\nLastly, other than elected *leadership,* do you want to get into politics, like a committee or something, to help use the process for good? Well then might as well be good to do that, and a lot of those are \"non-partisan\" so they don't even need to have a party affiliation. Those jobs may not even be paying, so they're often held by old rich guys, and taking a chair from one of them wouldn't be the worst thing. Think of it as a form of legal systemic sabotage, I guess.",

For example, if you make $100,000 as a politician but the average in your riding is $60,000, you would keep $60K and donate $40K to local causes every year\n\nAbiding by those things would effectively make you a surrogate for your entire community, which would be ideal.

I mean, you can take that authority from a statist and then not use it; hence lessening the amount of authority that exists. Do really good stuff in the area that people voted for you to do stuff in, but do it without leveraging your authority. Just be a leader.\u00a0\n\nAlso, hot take, we should be voting- not becuase it tends to do a lot of good, but becuase it can prevent a lot of bad. I get why a lot of anarchists don't, but we have to acknowledge the fact that we do live in this system and we can partake in it in some ways to help destroy it. If we don't vote, that doesn't mean that nobody comes to power, that doesn't slow down or stop the system at all, that just means that the statists have an easier time reinforcing that system.",

I mean, it absolutely sucks to vote for \"the lesser evil,\" it certainly doesn't feel good and i completely understand opting out- but i think that if we don't, we're letting the greater evil happen. The lesser evil isn't good by any means- it's not good to turn the trolley onto the other path- but i feel that it's far worse to let the four other people die. To be passive is a choice just as being active in a situation is a choice; if five people were poisoned and you had the antidote but didn't give it to them, i feel that you're responsible for that choice, and likewise you're still morally culpable for the action of inaction in deciding which way the trolley goes. But that's just my opinion of course.\u00a0\n\nAgain, I completely get that this system sucks and obviously it shouldn't be here, and I get the emotions and moral difficulty of choosing whether or not to vote. I respect your decision either way. I just like having discussions on philosophy and whatnot,, feel free to ignore my rambling.\n\nIt's difficult :') Either way, anarchy is inevitable.

            "body": "So I have a few thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, the values you hold in your heart don't really matter to anybody else. *Anarchism is what you do*. Pursuing state power is pursuing power over other people. There are plenty of socialists who do this but they're not *doing* the praxis of anarchism, they're doing electoralism.\n\nSecondly, I don't think it's a good idea to be orthodox and rigid and engage in purity testing. So you aren't doing anarchism. So what? Is it a good idea? Well, that depends. What do you hope to get out of doing this? Have you looked at whether other people with your intentions have tried this method to change the state from the inside? What happened? Were they successful? If so, what factors allowed them to succeed? If not, what barriers ended up setting them back?\n\nA lot of non-anarchist socialists, such as social democrats and many Marxists, have long accused anarchists of willingly fighting with one hand tied behind our backs in doggedly refusing to pursue state power. Surely we should be more pragmatic right? Well, the reason a lot of the world socialist movement in the late 19th and early 20h centuries turned towards anarchism isn't because of a moralistic desire to not rule other people, it was because socialist movements had tried electoralism and it didn't fucking work. The barriers to getting elected and staying in power are extremely high but once you're in, you are expected to be in charge of a capitalist economy and make decisions according to the laws of liberal institutions. It simply isn't an organizational institution that is designed to be anti-hierarchical or even democratic. It's designed to facilitate capital accumulation. Alienating people from resources like land and intellectual property necessitates alienating them from political power, including the power of their own violence. So radical socialist movements end up pacified, muzzled, co-opted, abandoning the very reasons they got into power. Things haven't fundamentally changed from the 19th century workers movement and socialists worldwide keep trying to make a socialist society though liberal methods. Despite many insisting it is the pragmatic way to go, not a single attempt at electoralism has succeeded in overthrowing capitalism. Do you think you're going to be the first? Really?\n\nI don't want you to blindly trust what I say so I'm going to link a few resources explaining why electoralism keeps failing the left. These informed my views but I invite you to read them and make up your own mind.\n\n[Why Elections Fail to Bring About Real Change](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/andrew-flood-why-elections-fail-to-bring-about-real-change) by Andrew Flood\n\nIt Could Happen Here episode [A Decade of Post-Occupy Political Parties Revisited](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-it-could-happen-here-30717896/episode/a-decade-of-post-occupy-political-parties-145163750/)\n\nIf you liked these two, I recommend reading he other essays in the [Socialist Faces in High Places](https://www.blackrosefed.org/socialist-faces-in-high-places-reader/) reader\n\n[The Bernie Sanders Paradox: When Socialism Grows Old](https://files.libcom.org/files/The%20Bernie%20Sanders%20Paradox.pdf) by Murray Bookchin\n\n\\[continued below\\]",

Some anarchists favor mass organizations like solidarity unions and mass assemblies and others favor temporary doing things through affinity groups that form for a specific purpose and dissolve once that objective has been completed, rinse and repeat. Again, anarchists haven't done this because they think \"I am an anarchist and this is what anarchists do\" but *arrived at these practices either through studying history or through trial and error and found them to be strategically superior to electoralism*. \"Anarchism\" is just a label to describe the conclusions they came to.\n\nBut I'm getting hung up on the \"personally\" bit. Let me be clear: anarchists don't solely act alone. Even the most hardcore individualist anarchists seek the power of association and cooperation with others to work towards a mutual liberty. Even Max Stirner's \"union of egoists\" simply describes people working together because everybody involved judges that cooperation towards a shared goal is in each of their shared interests.\n\nHow much have you studied anarchist writings on organization and social change? Because I feel like if you did that you wouldn't even have needed to make this post. But that's okay. Please don't feel bad. We've all been there. I had my \"what if we did a little electoralism?\" phase and have canvassed for the Democrats, for Bernie and even cofounded and chaired my regional Green Party of Washington chapter. It went nowhere and I've been much happier and more productive actually doing anarchism.\n\n\\[continued below\\]",

Our town council and manager has a pretty tight hold on the information that is available, the decisions that get made, and the rules that are in place. So I've looked for ways to try and decentralize that even a little bit, chip away at bureaucratic barriers, introduce ideas like participatory budgeting or creating community advisory committees. I see my role as helping to dismantle barriers, open up new possibilities, and redistribute power wherever I can. So far (it's been a year) it's been pretty small potatoes and still very much at odds with anything close to anarchism, but it's been an interesting parallel path learning experience.",

I don't recognize the legitimacy of a government with one foot in a past that endorsed legal slavery, naked imperialism and gender discrimination, I basically find it absurd to engage with it on the level of pure moralism the same way I wouldn't cast a fishing line into a tree expecting to land a nice trout, but I have the object permanence to recognize that it has effects which don't necessarily rely on my personal belief. To the extent that it will be there with or without my participation, then sure, I'll vote and boost certain candidates over others. Governmental action does still manifest in fewer or more people being able to eat, see a doctor, or learn to read, so if you see it all as bullshit, why not engage to the extent that you can leverage it to be the more rather than the fewer? I actually think a lot of politicians see it this way, in much the same way a lot of popes clearly believed they weren't going to face any kind of eternal and ultimate justice for actions they might outwardly call sin.
