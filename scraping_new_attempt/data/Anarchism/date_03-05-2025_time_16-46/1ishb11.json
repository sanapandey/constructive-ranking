    "selftext": "I'm deeply interested in the intersection of mysticism and anarchist thought. My first time genuinely entertaining anarchism\u2014before fully knowing what it was\u2014came through reading the Daoist classics. Their descriptions of almost pre-lapsarian societies, free from violence and rulers, where humble communal farmers lived in alignment with the \"Tao\"\u2014whatever that means\u2014deeply resonated with me. Since then, I've been drawn to mysticism, particularly the apocalyptic millenarianism of certain Christian sects like the Adamites and the Free Spirits, who rejected state and church authority in favor of community and direct communion with God\u2014a God they saw as equally present in everyone and everything.\n\nBut Lately i\u2019ve been reading up on anarchism, exploring thinkers like Bakunin and Kropotkin. And i see strong critiques of religion in their work\u2014both from an atheistic, materialist perspective and as a critique of church power\u2014 but I can\u2019t help but feel deeply drawn to the more mystical strands within anarchist thought. So when I recently stumbled upon Gustav Landauer (a Jewish mystic-anarchist) and Leo Tolstoy (an Orthodox Christian anarchist), I found my gang! I suppose I\u2019m quite woo-woo, and I\u2019m hungry for more thinkers, organizations, or movements that explore this intersection.\n\nSo, to anyone out there\u2014do you have any recommendations? Thanks, and have a good one!",

Ursula Le Guin is another great mystical anarchist, as is Dorothy Day. You might enjoy this episode of [Everyday Anarchism ](https://www.everydayanarchism.com/090-from-queering-anarchism-to-sacred-anarchy-vishwam-heckert/) I did with Graham about this topic and also maybe this [talk on sacred anarchy and yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWG1Qbx1368) I gave on a retreat.",
