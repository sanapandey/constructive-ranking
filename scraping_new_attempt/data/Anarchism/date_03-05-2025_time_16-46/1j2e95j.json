There are two symbols that immediately pop into my head. \n\nHitler famously used the Swastica, which has so many different meanings depending on how it\u2019s designed and where it was. Either way that symbol is now forever known in the Western World as the symbol of Nazism.\n\nThe US utilizes a bundle of arrows on its Great Seal. This bundle of arrows comes from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. This comes from the idea that when united the Confederacy would overcome all(I\u2019m simplifying). Now it\u2019s apart of the lexicon of symbols used by a government that oppresses them.  \n\nFurthermore the original purpose of the symbol occurs once a cultural meaning has been attached to it. That occurs in a specific culture, you can\u2019t expect the entire world to view a symbol one way. \n\nIn the US the three arrows are largely a fringe-symbol, its history is unknown except for the people who recognize it. Most people don\u2019t recognize it though, so the previous purpose remains unattached to the symbol. All that remains is the context the symbol is seen in and how the majority view the symbol upon looking at it.",
