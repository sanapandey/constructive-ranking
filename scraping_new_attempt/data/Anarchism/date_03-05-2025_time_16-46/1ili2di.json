Here are some ideas of highly valuable skills you may have available to share or you may want to learn:\n\nFood dehydrating (fruit leathers, apple chips, banana chips, pineapple rings, mango slices, zucchini chips...)\n\nSmoking foods (brisket, pork, chicken, turkey, salmon, cheeses, mushrooms, tempeh, eggplant, corn on the cob...)\n\nJarring and canning (veggies, fruits, jams & jellies, meats...)\n\nFruit tree pruning\n\nFishing\n\nBicycle maintenance (fix a flat, keep the chain in good condition, wheel truing, brakes adjustment...)\n\nCar maintenance (change oil, proper tire inflation, change air filters...)\n\nSmall engine repair (lawn mowers, roto-tillers, generators...)\n\nChicken tractor and rabbit tractor construction\n\nRaised bed gardening\n\nStraw bale gardening\n\nPermaculture practices\n\nHam radio\n\nNopales harvesting and bbqing (yes, please!)\n\nWhat else?\n\nLet's get together!\n\n\ud83c\udf40\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",
