    "selftext": "If the \"good side\" wants ammunition, why not start spreading the word of DEIA rather than just DEI? This pdf was removed from the opm.gov website noted Jan 2025. State.gov had a pdf on DEIA that was removed Nov 2024. If these are such bad things why is the other side (the one in control not the people's side) making it obviously harder to find information about? \n\nSo as we know that DEI is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Before recent times, most people never heard of it or did and forgot (myself included). What I was surprised to hear was that its actually been DEIA they've been going after which now stands for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, AND Accessibility. It makes sense why the country founded on racism would want to make it seem like they're being racist cause thats what was ran on. So it makes sense that if you remove the word Accessibility from the equation, it makes it seem like its about race when in reality its been much more than that. [Didn't a certain fascist make common knowledge harder to obtain through the used-to-be available means at the time (i.e. newspapers, books, articles)? /rhetorical]\n\nListen if you made it this far, I know we've gone passed the point of \"Words don't help\". But there are people with a voice who aren't in power who can spread a message. Honestly, I say let it burn until we formulate a way to fight and preferably take back whats ours. ",
