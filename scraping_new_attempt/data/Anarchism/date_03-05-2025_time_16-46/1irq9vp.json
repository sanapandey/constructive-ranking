I have also considered taxes as well as we are are in tax season. I don\u2019t know though if these are good ideas. I haven\u2019t seen it brought up yet and I\u2019d like to practice my beliefs as much as possible.\n\nWhat\u2019s do people think about this? Good idea, bad idea, no opinion, better options etc.\n\nHopefully the feds arent watching this post lol",

            "body": "Someone above mentioned Henry David Thoreau, but advised against tax resistance. Here's a few quotes from his essay Civil Disobedience, written in the mid 19th century:\n\n\"Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support, are ... the most serious obstacles to reform.\"\n\n\"Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.\"\n\n\"It is not a man's duty to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; ... but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and not to give it practically his support.\"\n\n\"If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. ... When the subject has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is accomplished.\"\n\n(When he says 'a man' he means 'a person'). It's kinda funny how in the conventional mind Henry David Thoreau is thought of as an honored American. During his day he wasn't popular, but today his name is well known. Unfortunately it seems not many today have read his writings.\n\nThoreau refused to pay taxes and went to jail, but just for one night because someone paid his tax for him. He never paid taxes after in his life, someone else always paid his bill. It's not an easy problem to solve once we know what we know. I've been really struggling with whether I should file taxes as well. \n\nAnother option I've seen is to intentionally never make enough money to where you owe taxes. Check out this guy: https://www.robingreenfield.org/defundinjustice/ \n\nGood luck and keep thinking!",
