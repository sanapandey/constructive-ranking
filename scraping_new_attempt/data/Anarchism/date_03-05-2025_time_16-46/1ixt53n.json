    "selftext": "(The Makhnovists/Makhnovshchina were a massive anarchist movement in Ukraine from 1918 to 1921, until they were wiped out by Bolsheviks).\n\nSource: *Draft Declaration of the (Makhnovist) revolutionary insurgent army of Ukraine adopted on October 20, 1919 at a session of the Military Revolutionary Soviet* in Alexandre Skirda's 2004 book *Nestor Makhno: Anarchy\u2019s Cossack*. You can read it here: [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexandre-skirda-nestor-makhno-anarchy-s-cossack](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexandre-skirda-nestor-makhno-anarchy-s-cossack) *(it's under \"Document No. 2\")*\n\n>**The soviet system.**\n\n>Our conception of an authentic system of free soviets we express as follows. In order to introduce a new economic and social life, the peasants and workers naturally and freely set up their social and economic organizations: village committees or soviets, cooperatives, factory and workshop committees, mine committees, railroad, Post and Telegraphs organizations and every other union and organization imaginable. In order to establish natural liaison between all these unions and associations, they set up agencies federated from the bottom up, in the shape of economic soviets whose technical task is to regulate social and economic life on a large scale. These soviets may be district soviets, town soviets, regional soviets, etc organized as the need arises on a basis of free principles. In no case would these be political institutions led by this or that politician or political party, who would dictate their wishes (as happens behind the mask of\u201csoviet power\u201d). These soviets are only the executive arms of the assemblies from which they emanate.\n\n>**Judicial and administrative machinery.**\n\n>As far as the depiction of this machinery as necessity goes, we must first of all reaffirm our position in principle: we are against all rigid judicial and police machinery, against any legislative code prescribed once and for all time, for these involve gross violations of genuine justice and of the real protections of the population. These ought not to be organized but should be instead the living, free and creative act of the community. Which is why all obsolete forms of justice \u2014 court administration, revolutionary tribunals, repressive laws, police or militia, Cheka, prisons and all other sterile and useless anachronisms \u2014 must disappear of themselves or be abolished from the very first breath of the free life, right from the very first steps of the free and living organization of society and the economy.\n\n>The free organizations, associations and soviets of workers and peasants must themselves prescribe this or that form of justice. Such justice should not be enforced by specialist officials, but rather by trustees who enjoy the confidence of the local population, by arrangement with it and utterly repudiating sanctions prescribed in the past. Likewise, popular self-defense must be based on free organization, and not left to specialist militias. Not only does formal organization of justice and defense by the State not achieve its aims, but it is a betrayal of all true justice and defense.\n\n>**The land question.**\n\n>The process of rebuilding and rapidly improving our agrarian economy which is at present in ruins and very limited, requires reorganization of the working of the land through absolutely free and voluntary decision-making by the toiling agricultural population in its entirety (obviously help from experts can be assumed). The village traders will have to be removed from this process quickly. We are persuaded that the solution to this problem of land will emerge unaided through communist organization of the peasant economy. Everyone will quickly be persuaded that growth of output and the meeting of all needs can only be ensured by the community and not by private individuals. However, any imposition of communism through constraint or top-down administration must be rejected.\n\n>The Bolsheviks\u2019 decree regarding \u201cnationalization of the land,\u201d which is to say the placing of all lands in the hands of the State (in fact the hands of the government, its agencies and functionaries) must be disregarded. A State take-over of land will inescapably lead, not to fair and free agricultural structures, but to the reappearance, of a new exploiter and master in the shape of the State, which will have recourse \u2014 as bosses do \u2014 to wage slavery and will impose all manner of corvees, levies, etc. upon the peasantry by force, just as its pomieschiki predecessors did. The peasantry will reap no advantage from being faced by just one master \u2014 the State \u2014 even more powerful and cruel than the thousands of little bosses, masters and pomieschikis. Lands seized from great estate owners should not be at the disposal of the State but placed in the hands of those who actually work them: the peasant organizations, free communes and other unions.\n\n>The manner in which the land, equipment and very organization of the agricultural economy are to be handled should be worked out freely at peasant congresses, after discussion and passed as resolutions, without any interference by any authority whatsoever.\n\n>**The labor question.**\n\n>Having witnessed many an attempt mounted by various political parties, \u201cbusinessmen\u201d or \u201cerudite personages\u201d to resolve the labor issue: and having scrupulously examined the idea and the results of state take-over (nationalization) of the means and instruments of worker production (the mines, communications, workshops, factories, etc) as well as of the workers\u2019 organizations themselves (trades unions, factory and workshop committees, cooperatives, etc.), we can announce with certainty that there is one genuine and fair solution to the workers\u2019 question: the transfer of all the means, instruments and materials of labor, production and transportation, not to the complete disposal of the State \u2014 this new boss and exploiter which uses wage-slavery and is no less oppressive of the workers than private entrepreneurs \u2014 but to the workers\u2019 organizations and unions in natural and free association with one another and in liaison with peasant organizations through the good offices of their economic soviets.\n\n>The housing issue is part and parcel of this and so we are offering only the essence of our position on this matter: one of the primary tasks of the free worker organizations is to see to equitable allocation of available accommodation and thereby pursue the construction. of requisite housing and this is achievable only in collaboration with those in charge of housing management (the house and district committee).\n\n>**The financial question.**\n\n>The financial system cannot be divorced from the capitalist system. The latter will soon be replaced by free communist organization of the economy, which will incontrovertibly lead to the disappearance of the finance system and its replacement by direct exchange of produce through the social organization of production, transportation and distribution.\n\n>However this transformation will not be effected in a day. Although the monetary system today may be in complete disarray it must of necessity continue to operate for a time. For the moment, it is vital that it be organized on new foundations.\n\n>Thus it is not a matter of retaining or re-establishing it, but only of adapting it on a temporary basis to fairer ground rules. Up until the October coup d\u2019etat, the people\u2019s wealth was concentrated either in the State\u2019s hands or in those of the capitalists and their agencies. Compulsory taxation and growing exploitation were at the root of this concentration. The Bolshevik-Communist authorities set themselves above the toilers as a boss-exploiter-State. They see themselves as the rulers and organizers of the country\u2019s monetary system. In fact the Bolshevik State and its officials have sole disposition of the people\u2019s wealth. In our view, this situation has to change radically.\n\n>In keeping with the introduction and expansion of the system of free toilers\u2019 soviets, ushering in a new and free life, all compulsory taxation should be discontinued and replaced by free and voluntary contributions from toilers. In a context of free and independent construction, these contributions will undoubtedly produce the best results.\n\n>By implication, the State\u2019s centralized public treasury, in whatever form it may appear (even-in the guise of \u201cPeople\u2019s Bank\u201d) should be wound up and replaced by the decentralized system of genuine people\u2019s banks established along cooperative lines. The founders and depositors of these banks should be workers and peasants only, that is to say their associations, unions and organizations, on the basis of a freely agreed levy.\n\n>In the case of unavoidable outlay on this or that undertaking or service at a regional or even national level (take Posts and Telegraphs, for instance), the general congress or soviet of that agency should receive the required sum from the people\u2019s banks. These latter may be communal, soviet or social, etc. as the case may be. The amount of these voluntary contributions will be determined by reckoning social needs and outlays. Not one single kopeck of the people\u2019s money may be spent without the express permission of the organization (be it congress, commune, soviet or union). At the appointed time, the different social services and agencies submit their projected expenditure to their respective agencies which, if need be, endorse the projected budget.\n\n>**The national question.**\n\n>Clearly, each national group has a natural and indisputable entitlement to speak its language freely, live in accordance with its customs, retain its beliefs and rituals, draw up its school books and have its own managerial establishments and agencies: in short, to maintain and develop its national culture in every sphere. It is obvious that this clear and specific stance has absolutely nothing to do with narrow nationalism of the \u201cseparatist\u201d variety which pits nation against nation and substitutes an artificial and harmful separation for the struggle to achieve a natural social union of toilers in one shared social communion.\n\n>In our view, national aspirations of a natural, wholesome character {language, customs, culture, etc.) can achieve full and fruitful satisfaction only in the union of nationalities rather than in their antagonism. One people\u2019s struggle for liberation leads naturally to the same chauvinistic struggle on the part of other peoples and the upshot, inevitably, is isolation and animosity between the different nations. Of necessity, this appreciation of the national question, a profoundly bourgeois and negative one, leads on to absurd and bloody national conflicts.\n\n>The speedy construction of a new life on socialist foundations will ineluctably lead to development of the culture peculiar to each nationality. Whenever we Makhnovist, insurgents speak of independence of Ukraine, we ground it in the social and economic plane of the toilers. We proclaim the right of the Ukrainian people (and every other nation) to self-determination, not in the narrow, nationalist sense of a Petliura, but in the sense of the toilers\u2019 right to self-determination. We declare that the toiling folk of Ukraine\u2019s towns and countryside have shown everyone through their heroic fight that they do not wish any longer to suffer political power and have no use for it, and that they consciously aspire to a libertarian society.\n\n>**Civil liberties.**\n\n>It must be self-evident that the free organization of society affords every practical opportunity for realization of what are called \u201ccivil liberties:\u201d freedom of speech, of the press, of conscience, of worship, of assembly, of union, of organization, etc.\n\n>**The defense of society.**\n\n>For as long as the free society may need to look to its defenses against outside attack, it will have to organize its self-defenses, its army. We see this as a free contingent, founded on the principle of election to positions of responsibility, and closely tied to the populace. It should be placed under the authority of the toilers\u2019 organizations of the towns and countryside, so as to protect them against any violent trespass on the part of any State or capitalist power, and to guarantee them freedom of social construction.\n\n>**Relations with foreign states.**\n\n>The expanded congresses that represent all the organizations from the towns and villages \u2014 which make up the free society \u2014 will appoint a commission whose task it is to maintain regular relations with foreign states. This activity ought to be public and free of ambiguousness: no \u201csecret diplomacy\u201d can be countenanced. Issues that the commission cannot resolve will be left for extra-ordinary congresses to debate and determine.",
