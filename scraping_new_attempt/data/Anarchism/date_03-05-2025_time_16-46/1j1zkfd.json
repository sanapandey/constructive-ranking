I just wanted to point out one thing I thought was inadvertently funny in the \"Perspective Shift\" chapter.\n\nI thought it was funny considering the perspectives, since while they are perspectives, only one of them is factually correct, given that building a business that becomes successful requires far less work than laboring your whole life once you have employees, and being within an already established industry means there is likely very little innovation actually involved, which just leaves entrepreneurial success, which yeah true I suppose.\n\nAnyways, I figure that's not actually important to the point of the video and would lead to a really long, off topic tangent. And given the sub this was posted in, I'd assume I'm preaching to the choir, it just jumped out at me because I thought the dichotomy was accidentally funny.",
