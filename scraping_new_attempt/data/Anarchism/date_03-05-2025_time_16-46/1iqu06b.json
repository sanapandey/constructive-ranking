    "selftext": "Something I've somewhere mused earlier, but was reminded of it due to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iqj3pa/in\\_light\\_of\\_trumps\\_recent\\_tweet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iqj3pa/in_light_of_trumps_recent_tweet/)\n\nNationalism, originally, meant the movement that saw national identity as something that ought to be the basis for the state; for each nation, there is one state, and for each state, there's a primary nation.\n\nIt presupposes both the existence of states and the existence - and importance - of a consistent experience of a national identity.\n\nNowadays, nationalism is more or less a negative term. It is mainly understood as meaning people who are particularly nationalist, typically in a way that sees to openly value their own nationality above others.\n\nYet, nationalism is in truth extremely prevalent, across almost the whole political spectrum, and on every level in society. People ask a foreign-seeming person where they come from to learn their *true* nationality, everyone must have a nationality associated with them in our record-keeping systems, rhetoric drawing from nationalism is prevalent among all parliamentary politics no matter the party (\"We fight for the brighter future for Americans!\", a statement basically any American politician could put out).\n\nNationalism has become so internalized and so presupposed and so naturalized that there isn't even a word left to describe it.\n\nThat, to me, is alarming and sad. For that to change, somehow, it should be once again made obvious that chauvinist nationalism and this sort of \"hidden\", everyday, unnamed nationalism are basically simply the same thing of different strengths.\n\nMichael Billig coined the term \"banal nationalism\" for this. But I doubt that's a term that's going to see much use; *banal* is also negative.\n\nInstead, what I think might be good would be to just commonly and often call this out as what it is - nationalism. No tippy-toeing, if an argument or a rhetoric or a phrase is rooted in nationalist thinking or presupposes nation states, we call it what it is - nationalism.",

Nationalism is a pretty specific form of group loyalty, and includes specific statements and presuppositions. Like that there's a national identity, which is somehow inherent to people, and which has discrete-enough boundaries as for clear groups of nations being identifiable. Then there's the idea that this identity should be the basis for a state, and that states should represent ideally one such identity at a time.\n\nYou can of course have a centralized governmental apparatus that routinely exploits groups of people without nation states and nationalism. Like the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.\n\nModern nations also didn't really even exist before 15th century or so - they were created, with specifics depending on region, but often how it was done was that one group determined what the national traits, from language to the minutae of customs, should be, and then enforced those within the available administrative bounds.\n\nEither way - point is, our current language, or the way it's used in any case, is somewhat lackluster in its expressiveness in this regard.  That should not be the case though, as something that is difficult to term in a way that was understood similarly by everyone, is also difficult to analyze and to appropriately challenge.",

For example there were still Celtic kings in Western Europe, and local Athens government still acted like under times when Athens was not a Roman city.",

                    "body": "Nationalism tends to always be hierarchical, as it presupposes high importance on national identity. States make this of course very obvious, but it wouldn't be much less problematic without states.\n\nSuppose, for example, that a group of people in an area do not feel like they share in the predominant national identity of the region. These people would almost certainly be at least partially ostracized.\n\nAnd administrative units and wider regional communities based on national identities are pretty much bound to promote action in their perception benefiting their own nation, even if it is at the expense of others - climate change, I think, is one of the best examples of that, and while one can argue that it's in part due to states and the capitalist economical system, the reality is that there's a strong nationalist element to it, too; people in many countries feel that it's more important for their affairs to be put first, even if doing so causes immense harm to people thousands of kilometers away from them.\n\nAnd then there's of course the issue of groups with a shared national identity being vastly different in size. When ever there's significant power differentials, there's bound to be uneven and unfair exchange. If nationalism is the prevailing thought along which society becomes organized, how could e.g. the Sami ever stand up to Norwegians?\n\nFinally, national identity is largely artificial. In lieu of hierarchies, strong national identities are much less likely to even exist. People do form groups sure, and people do identify with e.g. the community they were raised in, but this identification becomes distinct from nationalism. Nations and nation identities were specifically built and created, for the purposes of statist strength. They aren't an inherent part of the human experience.",

It is nationalism once the national identity is seen as something that ought to be the basis for human organization.\n\nAt that point, to be a fully qualified person, who has the same trust and respect as other people, in a given community, requires that person to share in the national identity. Which is hierarchical.\n\nI am also relatively sure that however one tries to phrase it, if national identities are strong and thought of as important or central, there will quickly be a situation where the benefit of one such group requires the exploitation or oppression of another such group. Again, even in lieu of states and government, how could the Sami ever face up to Norwegians?\n\nThey can't, and the only way they can, is if within this group of Norwegians, there's sizable amounts of people who don't think that Norwegian identity is particularly important or has any special value attached to it. These people will almost certainly be ones who end up identifying less through the nation, and more through our shared humanity and our shared needs as human beings.",

Most National-Anarchist doesn't even believe in multicultural commune, my similarly with them ends only in Name. \n\nYour ideas of Nationalism is too rigid, Nationalism at it conception is that an shared Mythos created by several individual with common ideas nothing more nothing less. \nmy analogies of Friend Circles is like you can have close friends but you can also be nice with other people even helping them with their problem, like for example there are one commune that is entire principle is non-interference then some disaster struck other commune, some individual in there disagree with non-interference in these cases, sp they can just voluntarily help them without communal approval it is free for them to help or being nice.\n\nHow is that being unique equivalent with hierarchy? Hierarchy is top-down governance of thing, also it much better to group people within same category with smaller commune than lump them in big commune that create tension even violence because  one can feel oppressed within those bigger commune with large varying homogenous ideas, like for example not many Individualist Anarchist want to lives in Social Anarchist society pipedream they will make separate community for themselves which is okay as long it not breeding violence. \n\nJust split then no one really give a fuck, Sami people can split, heck even Multicultural commune can split into Chaos evenmore into Micro Commune it doesn't matter because everything will fall apart splliting until it stabilized (and yes Chaos and Split is good for me if that good for anyone)\n\nAlso I doesn't care for example if separatism arises I just want my Nation being intact Symbolically, I don't really care if they govern themselves fully or basically just fully detached from my Nation.\n\nAlso I doesn't really care about clashing of ideals I believe in anti-secretarianism within Anarchism, yes I want to enact my own project but if my Nationalist project falling and for example mainstream Social Anarchist or Individualist anarchist behead the Leviathan then I good with it, my only crusade is against state, to create Anarchy good and proper nothing else, my Nationalist project is just side part of it. (I pretty much friendly with any type of anarchist except AnCap, AnMon and Racialist type of National-Anarchist, I also kinda dislike Pacifistic Anarchism as ideas but I have good relation with some of them, Social, Insurrectionary and Individualist anarchist is also in my contact good and ready)",
