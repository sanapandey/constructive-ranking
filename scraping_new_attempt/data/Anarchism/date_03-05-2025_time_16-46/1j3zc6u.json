    "selftext": "The goal is to use our hunting, gathering, and growing skills to help people a la mutual aid and try to decrease our dependence on capitalism to get our needs met. Right now only one person showed interest, but I'm now casting a wide net. This is an open invitation to anyone who is any flavor of anarchist or anarchocommunist in the area that has an interest in these things to share your wisdom and help us form a community. I am currently researching regulations for bow hunting and food distribution and I hope to learn enough from the existing Archery and hunting clubs in the area to teach anyone who wants to learn how to shoot arrows for good the skill. This may take a year or so to do, but I open things up now to gather interest and see what skills we have to work with and what skills we need to learn from other groups in the area. Please do not hesitate to shoot me a dm if interested.\n\nTldr: We're trying to start an anarcho-bow-hunting/foraging/growing club in Baltimore. Please join!",
