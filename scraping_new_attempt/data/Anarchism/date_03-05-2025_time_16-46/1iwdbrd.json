As part of my costume this year, I plan on gifting small things (seeds mainly, maybe some handmade jewelry, etc) to parading strangers. I wanted to include a little \"fortune\" in the gifts except I think I'd like for it to be some sort of inspirational (??) quotes from anarchist/anarchist-adjacent figures, authors, etc. Could also just be broadly related to mutual aid, community-building, etc. etc. What are some of y'all's favorites?",

The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\"\n\n\\-Maria Nikiforova\n\n\n\n>\"For this is what Anarchism finally means; the whole unchaining of life.\" \n\n\\-Voltairine DeCleyre\n\n\n\n>\"Anarchism is no patent solution for all human problems, no Utopia of a perfect social order (as it has so often been called), since, on principle, it rejects all absolute schemes and concepts. It does not believe in any absolute truth, or in any definite final goals for human development, but in an unlimited perfectibility of social patterns and human living conditions which are always straining after higher forms of expression, and to which, for this reason, one cannot assign any definite terminus nor set any fixed goal. The greatest evil of any form of power is just that it always tries to force the rich diversity of social life into definite forms and adjust it to particular norms.\"\n\n\\-Rudolph Rocker\n\n\n\n>\"Because anarchism is in its essence an anti-dogmatic and unstructured cluster of related attitudes, which does not depend for its existence on any enduring organization, it can flourish when circumstances are favourable and then, like a desert plant, lie dormant for seasons and even for years, waiting for the rains that will make it burgeon.\"\n\n\\-George Woodcock\n\n\n\n>  \n\"Whoever has the political competence to choose his own rulers is, by implication, already competent enough to do without them.\"\n\n\\-Luigi Galleani",
