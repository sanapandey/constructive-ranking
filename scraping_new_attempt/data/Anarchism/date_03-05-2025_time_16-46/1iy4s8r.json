The [main link](https://queersatanic.com/capital-area-satanists-hell-fire-holy-fire/) got stripped out but it's \"A Ritual of Remembrance and Vindication of Aaron Bushnell\". This is not magic but an intentional and formalized act of remembering someone and the cause for which they gave their life.\n\nYou can see past examples of some previous versions of these on the [Capital Area Satanists' channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CapitalAreaSatanists/videos) or [read one of the scripts](https://queersatanic.com/capital-area-satanists-red-as-blood-black-as-hell-a-fortification-ritual/) to get an idea of the tone and purpose, if that's easier.",

I\u2019ve been buying esims since the program started and it\u2019s nice to feel a tiny connection and to keep some folks connected and telling their stories. I\u2019ve got 3 right now that I\u2019ve been topping up for a couple weeks. Hoping their owners stay safe.",
