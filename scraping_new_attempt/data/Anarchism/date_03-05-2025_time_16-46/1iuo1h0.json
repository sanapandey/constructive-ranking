My brain can\u00b4t even make this shit up, -on its own.\n\n*But instead of international aid,*   \n*we only received a declaration of war*   \n*-via Twitter*   \n*-from some \"Trottel\"*   \n*-from \"Murika\"*  \n*-who can\u00b4t even spell solidarity or health care, right.*  \n*-who can't even drive a manual transmission or park backwards.*\n\nI am really not a Nationalist, never, but this was truly disgusting for all Nomad People there.  \nWe have such a rich and old history of all kinds of people living happily together under police brutality.\n\nAnd I patient tell them:   \n*\"Do you wanna hear about our blessed and anointed savior anarchism?*   \n*How it divideth the sea of tyranny with its staff of wisdom,*   \n*and how it shall lead us into our garden of eternal freedom!\"*\n\nI really try to lecture to them in their words.   \nThe lifestyle, excluding religion (in the sense of not considering it),   \nhas much in common with anarchy. Hard to belive but really true.  \nI really want to discuss this further but I cant find a plenum for.",

Without that, you have no private property, therefore no capital and no capital-ism.\n\nWith the doctrine of capitalism, you call for unregulated markets. However, anyone who's played a particularly popular board game knows that the person who owns the most takes the most money and eventually overcomes all else. Which is another reason for capitalism to depend on government... they need regulation in order to keep a free market free.\n\nAnarchism is opposed to capitalism, though. I'm surprised if you haven't read up on that, yet. Property is a hierarchy, and anarchism resists hierarchies ('resists' because it would be inaccurate to say 'opposes'. Hierarchies can be justified, or even *necessary*, in limited circumstances. Private property, aka exclusivity, isn't one of them).\n\nMy home, for example. That's my home for as long as I'm living in it. It makes absolutely zero sense for it to continue to be my home in perpetuity long after I cease to have use for it. It becomes a wasted shell unless it is occupied. I would much rather it be declared vacant after I leave it (if I vacate, I tell someone it's vacant. If I die, it can be assumed while they cart off my stinking, and also vacant, corpse), so that it can be occupied in short order.\n\nMeanwhile, I already know how it is to live in a place where one landowner owns vast tracts of land that nobody else can afford. That person's called a 'king', and the result is very far indeed from anarchism. His name's Charles and he earned his status through the great, heroic and selfless act of having slid out of Elizabeth's vagina.",
