    "selftext": "As refreshing as it\u2019s been to witness a conscientious surge, be mindful of how you let one another define class war. There\u2019s been an abundance of those who are newly radicalized, ready to become revolutionaries. Rightfully so, outrage has the masses standing on business. Those who\u2019ve been rooted should feel a responsibility to guide. Yes, there will be waves of people on the frontlines, but does it prove efficient that be your \u201cstation\u201d? \n\nI don\u2019t mean for the above to sound condescending.   Instead, a genuine plea that if you feel involved, please consider your stance. We\u2019ve long fought the rise of this becoming; many groups formed in unison. Yet, they still inflate themselves with non-existing power, desecrating all voices unaligned, whether it be as a whisper or a gaggle. The organizing took place when your core values either aligned with or urged against this chauvinistic bullshit. Throughout the era\u2019s, the fight has taken place. Strategizing is the only way we\u2019ll overcome this.\n\nIt\u2019s as though we\u2019ve become so desensitized to headlines bold with \u201cunprecedented\u201d that we\u2019re now ready to die for change. Don\u2019t allow \u201cmartyr\u201d to become hot press. Regardless of what radicalized you, do not effortlessly let radicalization become the end of you. That fight you felt is survival for all. How quickly we\u2019ll be eradicated, charging forward prepared to die if needed. No, prepare to stand your ground at all costs. Those costs being any means to protect and persevere. Ironically, we are the heritage foundation. We are in need of protecting history, arts, architecture, science, theologies, and literature. Enforcing the removal of false narratives and the rhetoric whitewashing of it all. Return culture and protect those indigenous to the practices. Understand economics and political science but refuse contributions of that knowledge to the undeserving. Make an example of how infrastructure does not equate to industrialism nor capitalism. Prove that this is all possible while prioritizing humanity.\n \nThe ideal objective is to dismantle and discard crony capitalism, kleptocracy, patriarchs, oligarchs, fascism, elitism, misogyny, racism, police state - I mean fuck, for a crew to complain that LGTBQ was too long, they\u2019ve sure pulled their fair share of the alphabet. To go against such will be tedious. An argument could be made from my \u201cabolish all government\u201d babes. Ashes too can be viewed as tiny little fragments remaining of a system now applied to the future as nothing more than a goddamn example. Just remember to go after the throats of the oppressors, not the oppressed, and be wise enough to know the difference. Still a complete cog in the system seeking fair justice and liberty for all with perhaps a sprinkle of order? You\u2019ll need to be careful with the disassembling as you\u2019re looking to reconstruct. All sides should remain open to the idea of direct democracy on some scale.\n\nThis thought became urgent to share when topics regarding 2/5 protests became large-scale. Some of the more linear thought processes I\u2019ve witnessed debate whether it is a trap or not. The argument being that it doesn\u2019t matter; solidarity is key. I completely agree that solidarity is key and should be the fundamental. You can protest in solidarity many ways. Before you stand in front of your capital, \nBuildings ask who is defenseless and vulnerable in the neighborhood over. Did we take advice on protecting ourselves from a surveillance state while accidentally whistleblowing an ally? Did we become irrational from fear? Yes, the masses need to be in the streets standing up for what\u2019s right, but how many of us need to be in front of a building full of government officials that have done absolutely nothing aside from proving they can\u2019t read your signs nor hear your words? To most of them, you\u2019re fanatical. Take your march to the border, to neighborhoods of culture and diversity, to domestic violence shelters where they are already being attacked. Stay true to your pacifist nature if needed by supporting local communities. Read books to the children scared, bring groceries to the families hiding, be ready to stand for them while strengthening them. Embrace spatial awareness and you\u2019d be shocked at the many ways you fight. I fear while we are so focused on what will come of Wednesday, they will be going after our most vulnerable. What a waste it would be, to finally have opened your eyes to the reality, only to succumb to its wrath.",
