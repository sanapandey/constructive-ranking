    "selftext": "Comrades here are some news from the other side of the ocean, sorry the text is in french and it already has been translated from German to french and you should use a automatic translator such as deepl to have it in your language but it's worth the reading IMHO. It's a bit long but totally worth especially shareable to all the normies who enjoyed the video back in the days. Spread awareness.\n\nFOR CONTEXT, the mud wizzard is that dude (or sis we don't know the identification and let's keep it gender neutral) who went viral during massive protests in Germany against coal mines. Riot cops being absolutely stuck in mud and not anymore feared, pathetic and armless with their arsenal for urban guerrilla. *Then a wild mud wizzard appears* \n\nIt's no Luigi level but hey its not a competition as well.\n\nDo not be mistaken , the cops were absolutely violent whenever they could and now the mud wizzard is facing charges for assault. Another level of violence.\n\nI will comment the video in the comments because it's just plain and simple jouissive to see riot Police being absolutely patheticly neutered by  mud. \n\nI just wanted to share this development about this meme and the statement of it. \n\nPlease find all my support in these trying times we're facing.\n\nWe are all in the same boat a d international Solidarity is our best weapon. \n\nBe safe comrades. \n\n\u270a\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\u270a ",
