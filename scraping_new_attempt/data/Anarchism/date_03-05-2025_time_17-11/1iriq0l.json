The only one I've found so far was Stirner fan fiction, which was rather disappointing, but I feel like there's a huge wave of new thoughts/praxis coming out of the States, and I'd like to know more about it. about it",

There were German-Americans among the \"martyrs\" of Haymarket. Rudolf Rocker, original theorist of anarcho-syndicalism was German. There's Gustav Landauer, whose *Aufruf zum Sozialismus* (1911) probably counts as a classic of socialist literature. And Max Nettlau, who remains underappreciated as an anarchist historian and theorist. The anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th century were pretty successfull in communicating and networking on an international level.\n \nFrom more recent times I've enjoyed the *Z\u00fcndlumpen*, whose editors were certainly inspired by US-based journals *Green Anarchy* and *Black Seed*. But that's more or less where my enthusiasm ends. Today's German anarchists' emphasis on Marx is understandable maybe, given the history, but it's not at all where I'm at. The amount of Israeli flags waved at protests, often mixed with antifa symbols, is embarassing to say the least. So is *Die Platform*'s very own comparisons with Bolshevism.",

Five of the eight anarchists tried in the Haymarket affair were German born, three of whom worked on the radical paper the Arbeiter Zeitung\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeiter-Zeitung_(Chicago)",

Queer himself, he was perhaps the first radical in the United States to talk openly about homosexuality and influenced Emma Goldman and Benjamin Tucker on the subject. There's not a lot of English language scholarship on him, but some stuff in German. I'm writing a book on the history of queer anarchism which will feature him.",
