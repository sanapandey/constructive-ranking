    "selftext": "The culture on one side of the \"war\" is the culture of the capitalists themselves, and is the culture required for capitalism to function.\n\nWe live in a settler colonialist society. Tons of cultures are being actively genocided so we can't rely on anything other than capital, so they can't rely on anything but capital.\n\nWe live in a society where prisons are used for slave labor. The justification for prisons themselves, who we send there, and why its ok to ignore this, is all cultural. The \"war on drugs\" was a war on specific cultures, that is how they chose the specific drugs to target.\n\nWe live in a society with a gender binary. The point of that is to divide us up into smaller groups to maintain inefficiency, so we must rely on capital. Cooking a pot of pasta for ten people isn't five times harder than two people.\n\nWe live in a society where poverty is justified on the hatred of disabled people. People only \"deserve\" what they are able to claim by force. One of the biggest arguments I hear for capitalism is \"if you work harder you get more\". Whether that is true or not, the hatred of disabled people is the base. Being afraid of being treated as disabled, of being called \"stupid\" and \"lazy\", is a big reason why so many are scared of joining us. \n\nThe fascist harassment of minorities won't stop just because you stop thinking about us and protecting us as well. Fascist harm is spread across all of us. As one person drops out, the water level rises and more of us go under. The only way to save any of us is to save all of us. There is no sacrificing a small minority for the good of the whole. \n\nYou must take the needs of every oppressed group seriously.\n\n\n\"Substituting\" the \"culture war\" for the \"class war\" is leaving the class war.",

Creating a hyerarchy between oppressed.\n\nFighting against the culture war and refusing to engage in it, is fighting the class war.\n\nFighting against those who spread it, those who perpetuate it's ideology by essentializing and treating people based on their identity is fighting the class war.\n\nAknowledging it's existence and it's purpose. Aknowledging that the upper class use it to oppress some of us more and to push some of us to become class traitors for privileges and other false promises. Is fighting the class war.\n\nEngaging in the culture war by picking the side of one identity against another one isn't fighting the class war\u00b9.\n\nFighting the culture war by essentializing and categorizing people based on their identity. Spreading the upper class ideology and discourse isn't fighting the class war\u00b9.\n\nIf you use the same language, the same logic and the same framework as the upper class but instead of saying that group A is awfull and evil you say that group B is awfull and evil. You are not fighting the class war\u00b9.\n\n\u00b9Or at least you fight it but not on the side of the oppressed. Because by engaging in the upper class diversion you are keeping them in power.\n\nYes fighting against all systemic oppressions is a necessity to win the class war. People who choose to ignore some systemic oppresions are objective allies of the system.\n\nBut fighting against systemic oppressions doesn't mean picking the side of the double oppressed against the privileged oppressed. Fighting against systemic oppressions means fighting with those who want to end it against those who perpetuate it. Not white vs poc but racist vs anti-racist. Not NT vs ND but ableist vs anti-ableist. Etc. The former is culture war, the later is class war. People who engage in culture war instead of class war (as i described it) are objective allies of the system too.",

Like yea its about racist vs anti-racist. But if the only anti-racist people you see are white (which is luckily not the case) then i feel like its doomed to fail. There is something about the Identities and experiences of oppression of bipoc people that lays the foundation of what it means to be anti-racist.\nAnother example is when priviledged people try to be anticapitalistic. It is still good to have them but it lacks depth and experience from those who suffer most form capitalism.\n\nSo i find it important to look at identity but i fully agree that its about those who find or try to find actions to end oppression and not about who is oppressed or not.",

Cool get under the guillotine with the rest.\n\nThe wealthy are the ultimate oppressors they supercede and indeed cause most all other forms of oppression.\n\nSo no the culture war is not synonymous with the class war.",

I just want us focusing on systems of oppression instead of individuals.\n\n\nWe spent 10-15 years online arguing with bigoted clowns and occasionally getting them fired. Meanwhile the right was focused on passing laws against marginalized people. We need to be way more focused on getting real, legal change and avoid getting caught up in dealing with individuals that have no real power.\u00a0",
