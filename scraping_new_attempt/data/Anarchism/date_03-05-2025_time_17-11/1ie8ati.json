At the end of the steps it basically says \u201cand if they break into your house, remain silent. You shouldn\u2019t say anything\u201d and things to that extent. \n\nIt feels like the bigger establishment wants a clean sweep without any record or fight from these immigrants even if theh breach the privacy of their homes\n\nWhat I\u2019m thinking is should they be writing their names and history, or anything relevant to their situation somewhere and drop it off at a church or something? Like in case things happen we know who was taken and who they were in our community? What are some safe, public spaces for people to go to where they can look out for those scared and don\u2019t know what to do?",

This would also depend on the organisation, but in my experience it was a better option than the medical system (I felt like I was the one in control of my recovery and I wasn't pressured to do anything) and they redirected me towards other organisations as well, as a way for me to get some support at first but also as a way to open up and give to the community later on, while also improving my own wellbeing.",

I found a surprising amount of confidence in myself when talking w like minded people in a workshop about something I'm passionate about. I'd say definitely look for an org or group that speaks to you, and see how welcoming they are. I know it's not great advice to say \"jsut put yourself out there!\" but it's a foundation of organizing. Obviously once you know your group or people, you can take a seat back and do more administrative or other tasks that aren't too much about socializing. I feel you comrade.",

A Collective, a Radical Union, ~~the Guerrilla Gardening Group that looks fun but trying to get the time to join and you want to meet new people but you don't want to impose~~ (okay, projecting with the last one), they are communities. They need a sense of community to function. Without it, we fall into what I can only describe as collective loneliness.\nLook at all successful mobilisations of anarchism, proto and current. All came out of a sense of community.",
