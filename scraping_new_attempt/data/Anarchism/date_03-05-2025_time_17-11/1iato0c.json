    "selftext": "I'm looking for concrete steps one can take as a US citizen to take action for immigrants rights now.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening immigrant safety by calling for mass deportations, the dismantling of longstanding rights, and policies that dehumanize immigrants.\n\nThus far I've identified the obvious: donating, informing yourself and others, urging members on congress to keep families and communities together, take part in protests, rallies, vigils, etc\n\nWhat are some ways that you might be contributing to the cause that you see is making positive changes in your local community or elsewhere?\n\n  \nNote: I've been struggling to find a good subreddit to post this question in as r/immigration is actually not filled with real immigrants but people who hate them. There seems to be a lack of immigration subreddits with people trying to help the current situation... If anyone knows about a helpful subreddit for this type of thing, please let me know.\n\nI am an anarchist and value the opinions of those who reject the state and gravitate towards forms of protesting and doing their part to make changes where they see injustice, no matter how small.",

Pass out to anyone and everyone. Leave piles or boxes of them at bus stops, near markets, grocery stores, and home depot parking lots. \n\nIt's a small step, because no matter how many people \"know their rights\", it doesn't really matter when ICE regularly breaks the law and violates those rights anyways. But it's a start, and it might make some tiny amount of difference. \n\nIf you know people who are undocumented, see if you can provide services to them like getting groceries, offering rides, or helping out with other day-to-day tasks that they might be skipping because they don't want to leave their home as much. WITHOUT identifying them or outing them in any way obviously. \n\nTry to simply go out in your city to places where ICE might be likely to try to get people. Spot them, document, share, call your rapid response line, etc. But more importantly, if you can, physically or verbally disrupt any arrests you see taking place. Say things like: \"Don't say anything. You don't have to answer their questions. Are we under arrest? Then we are free to go. We are walking away now.\" Film the arrests. Be persistent and annoying and disruptive (without being so \"disorderly\" as to cause them to arrest you). Shout \"LA MIGRA\" so anyone else nearby is aware of what's going on and can get away if needed.",

I ordered a ton and want to leave them around my very latino neighborhood, but I'm new to this and kind of scared of being yelled at by local business owners for leaving cards there. Should I ask or just leave a stack near the register and dip?",

No point in putting them somewhere they're not wanted, someone would just throw them out I guess. Couldn't hurt to ask - if they say no, just move on. \n\nOne thing that I've been thinking about but haven't done yet is trying to make little boxes for them to sit in. I'm imagining like cutting a small section of a cardboard box, open on top to hold some of the red cards. Then figuring out how to secure the box to something out on the street like a telephone pole. Maybe a staple gun or something. \n\nAlso, look for anywhere else any kinds of paper things are distributed. Like newspaper boxes (if those still exist in your area lol). Or depending on your area buses often have little holders that maps or route info gets put in. Maybe local bulletin boards or wherever people put up flyers.",
