            "body": "Anyone who has used the internet for any amount of time has been profiled very extensively. Just don't post about things you do, or things you intend to do. It doesn't matter if people know your ideaology. We aren't at that stage yet. We are at a stage where being organized is the most crucial thing. Find your local Food Not Bombs, queer spaces, Universalist Unitarian congregations, etc. These are the places where you will find people who share your values. Maybe tone down your socials but tbh if you stop posting your dogma the timing of that can be used as an indicator of premeditation. \n\nWebsites can track you very accurately. People think it's all about the cookies, but the website can see things like your OS and its version. Same with your browser, screen resolution, certain hardware peripherals, the extensions you have, etc. Take in their totality, these pieces of information can be used to track you across the internet with a very high degree of precision, with cookies acting as a sort of map of all the sites you have visited. Those are also visible to any site you visit. \n\nThe biggest issue in that paradigm is Google. They ses you anywhere there are Google ads or Google analytics. Then you factor in their app suite like Google maps. They essentially already know everything about everybody. There's no point in trying to shield others. Their allegiance is already betrayed by their online activity, even if they never typed a single word of anarchic thought. \n\nYour best hope for opsec is to:\n\n1) buy a device made before the Intel/AMD backdoors were put in (circa 10-15 years ago)\n2) Avoid Windows, install Linux. Microsoft OS is constantly phoning home to tell MS what you're using your device for. \n3) configure your computer's networking so it can't visit the internet except through a VPN tunnel. Use an independently audited service which does not log user activity. Set your exit node in a country with strong data protections such as Sweden and avoid countries like the US, UK, France, etc. \n    *Bear in mind that while services like Proton can't read your emails, they're still obligated by law to answer warrants which ask for specific info like IPs associated with an email account, and proton DOES log such information in their services. They do offer TOR email service which is more secure. \n4) Only use the tor browser. Do not use extensions. Do not use exotic screen formats. Limit the unique features of your interface in any way possible. Linux and TOR narrow the target a lot, but they are worth the hit to your ability to hide in a generic fingerprint. There's no point of being generic if (someone) gets your ISP and IP address. \n5) Do not use the same username across services. \n6) Only use Signal, Matrix, or TOR-Based peer-to-peer encrypted messaging services\n\nI think that pretty much covers the basics.",

So freeing oneself always starts with different and Radical thought, you shouldn't feel ashamed of that or worthless for that. \n\nSecondly, because we are all Anarchists, this means in the eyes of Capitalism and State we are all a threat and a walking hazard, so you wouldn't be the only one that represents a threat to these oppressive institutions, there are numerous of us out there, and on here on this forum. \n\n\nAnd for the third, there are probably some fellow revolutionaries in your area, they're just not known or keep themselves hidden or are probably in a similar situation like yours. For example I didn't know that I had fellow Anarchist revolutionaries in my area but they're here in my city. \n\nSo don't have to feel worthless or ashamed because you have found or formed a community yet. Organization and prefiguration takes time and multiple that people are willing to associate and collaborate. \n\n\nI get the feeling that we are all scattered out and it's hard to find community because of that and the Capitalist individualism that caused alienation and isolation. \n\n\nBut other than that you shouldn't feel worthless. Times are hard and revolution is even harder to achieve because if the oppressive systems we are battling on a daily basis.",

So take any advice regarding police and state with a grain of salt.\n\nFrom my personal experience, you\u2019re gonna be ok. State surveillance and anti-\u201ccommunism\u201d is a thing, but if you really organize you learn quickly that if you\u2019re organizing with your neighbours (neighborhood association, tenant things, etc.) it\u2019s likely the state will not intervene or even mess with you.\n\nAnd posting things on social media isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\n\nHeck, when I was community organizing, an old high school friend mentioned that the cops knew about me. And that, unless you\u2019re doing shit like the right wing paramilitary types, then the police/stare really don\u2019t give a shit about you.\n\nFrankly, they likely won\u2019t care too much about your organizing efforts because most anarchist organizing tend to be things like food not bombs, which is really just an insular friend group perpetuating a subculture.\n\nThe \u201clack of police response\u201d to antifa is because the police largely see modern American/US antifa (read: spicy leftist mobilizing) as a joke. \n\nSorry for the long doomer response,OP. \n\nI guess TLDR; don\u2019t stress too much about it.
