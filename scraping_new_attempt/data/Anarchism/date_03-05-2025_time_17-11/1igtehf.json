    "selftext": "ICE recently showed up at my workplace asking about one of my coworkers. The floor manager said \"I'm not sure if he's here today, I'll go check\" to buy time then went and warned the coworker ICE was here for him, told him to hide and said he'd go tell the agents he wasn't there. But the coworker insisted on going to talk to them. I don't know why he thought talking to them was a good idea, likely thought it was a simple misunderstanding since he's here on a work visa, but our manager couldn't talk him out of it.\n\nThey dragged him out in handcuffs. \n\nThis happened 8 days ago. His lawyer has been in contact with our general manager since then but we really have no information on his situation beyond which detention center they're holding him in.\n\nThis never should've fucking happened. I'm pretty sure they didn't even have a warrant so while I understand my floor manager was well-intentioned and was trying to cover for my coworker, he really should've just immediately told them to fuck off. \n\nI figured it'd be a good idea to put up some know your rights posters, specifically that are aimed at knowing your rights in the workplace and how to protect your coworkers when ICE shows up. Most of the KYR posters I've found online are focused on knowing your rights at home / on the street. Any links to good KYR posters are appreciated! I'm looking for English and Spanish versions. Also I might just make my own so recommendations on what info to include also helps! For context, I work at a restaurant in Massachusetts.\n\n**TL;DR ICE arrested my coworker last week with no warrant after he agreed to talk with them. I'm looking for KYR in the workplace posters that I can put up to help prevent this from happening again.** ",
