We collaborated with\u00a0**No Voice Unheard**\u00a0because they had already begun gathering information and connecting with state organizers before we had. We also worked with\u00a0**Build the Resistance**, which provided a platform to publish this information cohesively while we set up event logistics through Pol Rev\u2019s event platform. These organizations were\u00a0**absolutely vital**\u00a0in making this possible. Without them, we would never have been able to pull this together for you.",
