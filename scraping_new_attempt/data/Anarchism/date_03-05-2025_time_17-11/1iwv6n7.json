This initiative will serve as a digital repository centered on revolutionary syndicalism, covering topics such as syndicalism, anarchosyndicalism, and revolutionary industrial unionism. Additionally, the library will provide dedicated space for documenting experiences of proletarian autonomy, including Italy\u2019s Operaismo of the 1970s and other self-management economic initiatives.\n\nThe library\u2019s content will be moderated by the council of the\u00a0[Arquivo Lucy Parsons](https://arquivolucyparsons.wordpress.com/), ensuring that it reflects critical and revolutionary perspectives. Currently, the Arquivo Lucy Parsons operates on a free WordPress account, and I lack the technical expertise to develop a full-featured library on AmuseWiki. That\u2019s why we are reaching out to skilled programmers who can help build and maintain this platform.\n\nYour contribution\u2014whether through coding, design, or other technical support\u2014will be vital in creating a resource that preserves and disseminates the international legacy of the proletariat. We also welcome ideas on how international syndicalists can support this initiative through small donations, strengthening our collective effort to keep the spirit of revolutionary syndicalism alive in Brazil and beyond.\n\nAbout Arquivo Lucy Parsons: Founded on February 20, 2025, in Cear\u00e1, Brazil, the Arquivo Lucy Parsons emerged as a response to the historical absence of theoretical debate on revolutionary syndicalism in Brazil. Although officially established in 2025, it is part of a broader process of systematic militant research that began in 2024, grounded in a trajectory of Cear\u00e1-based militants dating back to 2013. Born from the militant movement that seeks to reconstruct revolutionary syndicalism\u2014especially in Cear\u00e1\u2014the project aims to bridge theory and practice by rescuing marginalized narratives and fostering workers\u2019 self-management.\n\nIf you are a developer or technologist passionate about social justice and workers\u2019 rights, please consider lending your skills to this important project. For more information or to get involved, please contact us at\u00a0[arquivolucyparsons@proton.me](mailto:arquivolucyparsons@proton.me)\u00a0(or just DM me).\n\nIn solidarity,  \nArquivo Lucy Parsons Team",
