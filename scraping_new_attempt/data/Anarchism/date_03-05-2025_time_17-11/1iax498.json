    "selftext": "For too long, we\u2019ve been fed a lie. A lie that we\u2019re free, that this system works for us, that if we just work hard enough, we\u2019ll achieve the dream. But look closer\u2014the dream is a mirage, designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards. The few, those at the top, have declared themselves gods, ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe.\n\nThe truth is harsh, but it must be said: we are nothing more than cogs in their machine, spinning endlessly to make the rich richer, the powerful more powerful. But if we can\u2019t live free, the system can\u2019t stand.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle. That there aren\u2019t enough resources, so we must compete, fight, and claw for scraps. But that\u2019s another lie. Think about this: there are over 333 million people in America alone\u2014and the reality is, we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production, to live sustainably, and still thrive. There\u2019s enough land, food, energy, and technology to create a society that ensures every single person\u2019s survival and dignity.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we? Because this system thrives on greed. Corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry. They\u2019d rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit. They\u2019d rather exploit our personal data, manipulate us with marketing, and push endless consumerism than admit the truth: this isn\u2019t about meeting our needs; it\u2019s about feeding their power.\n\nThey sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires. They\u2019ve turned our lives into commodities, our data into currency, and our labor into fuel for their machine. The system wasn\u2019t built to serve us\u2014it was built to enslave us. But our unity, their downfall.\n\nHistory shows us the truth. From the Gilded Age of robber barons to the billionaires of today, the system has always been rigged. Corporations crush workers to cut costs. Politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder. Wars are waged to protect profits, not people. Many voices, one movement is their greatest fear.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014they only win if we stay divided. They\u2019ve spent decades pitting us against each other. Left vs. right. Rural vs. urban. Black vs. white. It\u2019s a strategy straight out of Orwell\u2019s 1984. They want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy. Because they know the truth: we are more than cogs in their machine; we are the revolution.\n\nThink about the power we hold. Together, we outnumber them a thousand to one. Together, we are unstoppable. They control the wealth, the media, and the laws, but none of that matters if we refuse to comply. If we unite, resist, and rebuild, we can create a system that works for all of us, not just the privileged few. The time is now: unite, resist, rebuild.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about tearing down their machine. It\u2019s about building something better. A future where no one is exploited for a paycheck, where no child goes hungry, where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo. It\u2019s about reclaiming the dream they\u2019ve stolen from us. Rise as one, reclaim the future.\n\nWe are done begging for scraps from their table. We\u2019re done watching as they strip our communities of opportunity while lining their pockets. We\u2019re done believing the lie that this is just the way things are. No gods, no masters\u2014only freedom.\n\nThey want you to feel small. Powerless. But remember this: their power comes from us. Every hour we work. Every dollar we spend. Every time we stay silent. Fight the few, empower the many. If we withdraw that power, their system crumbles.\n\nWe stand at a crossroads. On one side is the broken system they want us to accept. On the other is a future we can build together. A future where we\u2019re no longer cogs in their machine but the architects of our destiny. The choice is clear: their system, our power, one reckoning.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with the words of Thomas Jefferson: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.\"\n\nLet this be our duty. Let this be our spark. Let this be the moment we reclaim what is ours.\n\n",

It isn't. How do I know? Because I'm not a heterosexual white guy. your idpol bullshit won't work on me. I've lived it harder than most, and I know what the boot actually fucking looks like. I think the problem a lot of you have is that you just don't actually talk to people who are different from you. I do. I go out of my way to.
