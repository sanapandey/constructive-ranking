    "selftext": "I want to help make a difference, but as a child that doesn't seem to have guardians who listen to them about world issues in their own house, I can't go to protests or donate. But I still want to prepare for anything that's gonna go down and aid others while doing so. In my highschool, what should I focus on knowledge wise? I want to be able to use the tools of knowledge against the providers. \n\nEven after school, I'd like to know where to even start with helping and educating myself. Any advice helps no matter what it is. I don't want to just post about rebelling- I want to help start the flame.",

You should start reading ideological and historical books and when you have the chance go to protests and most importantly TALK WITH PEOPLE. Gain more knowledge and expierience. Ask everyone about actions and books etc. And with some steps you will reach a point where you can help start the flame.",
