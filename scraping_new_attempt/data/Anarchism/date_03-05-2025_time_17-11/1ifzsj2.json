    "selftext": "So I remembered something that someone said during brexit which was that people needed to stop listening to the experts and this was because the experts were saying stuff before 2008 and then the financial crisis hit and then people stopped trusting the experts and I'm wondering if that cascaded into a deep mistrust of certain institutions and the government and things like that. It happened in the UK but I'm also wondering if it happened in the US. The rise of the internet was happening around that time too so while many people may be blaming the internet and while the internet may be of contributing factor I'm wondering how much things like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis also played a part and I took a look at the trustworthiness level the American people trusted the government over a period of time and I saw that there was a rise around around 9/11 and then it just went down and it seemed like it never really recovered. \n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/\n\nAnd as you probably know things like recessions and financial instability create an opportunity for the rides in the far right.\n\nI'm just interested in your thoughts on this as well as wondering why people started distrusting around 9:11 because I thought that people would have been really excited about that because it was such gung-ho patriotism and nationalism and I thought people would have been very trusting of the government at the time but it seems like it almost immediately went down after the attack rather than going up first and then going down which is what I would have expected more.",

            "body": "Nope. It has always been around. It has been getting worse all my life.  I'm in my 40s. But you can find quotes from 100 years ago about anti intellectualism ruining politics. Trust in science and other institutions always goes down when people are struggling more economically. It also goes down when our education systems focus more on job training than how to think critically. There are a lot of factors. \n\nRichard Hofstadter\u2019s Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (1963) provides one of the most comprehensive historical analyses of anti-intellectualism in the United States. He traced its roots to 19th-century religious movements and Jacksonian populism, but he argued that McCarthyism and Cold War paranoia in the mid-20th century greatly accelerated it.\n\n\"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\u2019\u201d\n\u2013Isaac Asimov 1980\n\n\"I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time\u2014when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or question those in authority; when, clutching their crystals and nervously consulting their horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what\u2019s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.\"\n\u2013Carl Sagan 1995",

                            "body": "Here are my thoughts. This is just a thought experiment I don't have a fully baked theory. \n\nLiberalism is basically the game that most benefits the most property owners. \n\nNationalism/paranoia / McCarthyism benefits the most *powerful* property owners, because as recessions occur, those with the most wealth can afford to buy up assets that are (temporarily) much lower valued.  The owners of the lower valued assets, often collectively owned by more stockholders, have no choice but to sell. It's literally their fiduciary responsibility to sell in some cases. \n\nSo, imagine a game where if you leave everyone to their own devices everything gets more valuable from an economic valuation standpoint. Now imagine if you could change the rules of the game for a while so that everything was worth less. Now the big fish can gobble up the small fish and when you set the game back to liberalism there are fewer players of the game. \n\nDo that for a few decades and all of a sudden you're down to literally just a few, real players. That's where we are now.\n\nIt seems a fractal of why the United States insists upon quote liberal democracies and markets being freedom wherever they deem it appropriate, because the United States has the largest coffers to outbid and out play any and all owners in any new markets as the United States has an entire continent and then some of stolen wealth.\n\nIMO what we're seeing now is the US economy and its people being more on the \"board\" of the game I describe above. Nothing is happening to the US populace that US actors haven't done globally. It's just, they don't need as many middle and upper level managers in the United States for the global game, and there's much less need for additional financing like the kind secured through coerced transition to 401Ks.",

Living standards were rising, social issues were slowly being treated ect. When the wealth is making it to everyone in some capacity (enough for them to feel it) people don't feel scared, they don't feel the need to cling on to what they've got, they don't need to look for enemies as strongly.\n\nFor a time being people believe the world was positive sum. We could all grow and benefit together.\n\n2008 shook people's faith in the economic and political orders ability to provide that positive sum. And the fascist lieing in wait like hydra capitalised that moment to tell people the world was zero sum. Others gain is your loss. It you against them. The hardship you're feeling is because only one of you can benefit and if you're suffering it must be because they're gaining.\n\nThis is the core belief of the modern right. They don't just have a victim complex but they're convinced their their opponents must be living the high life of handouts and benefits. Because as much as they suffer, other must be gaining.\n\nHitler did the same thing to an impoverished Germany that couldn't reconcile it's identity post ww1. Something that may smarter people have written a lot about.\n\n\nThat zero sum thinking has been around in humans for a very long time. It's a lizard brain thought processes we can very easily slip back to. And facists happily wait for conditions to be right to capitalise on feelings of scarcity to push people into that mindset.\n\nYes people are racist and bigoted and shit. But the culture war shit wouldn't be able to gain nearly as much purchase if 2008 hadn't happened.",

Or even more likely, kill them outright.\n\nSo, to answer your question, you are getting the 'feeling' because those are two 'mask off' events that happened during your lifetime. Well, most of us have been alive long enough to see other events that felt weirdly similar. You will be alive to witness more of these events. And they will keep happening. And hopefully one day you'll realize that this country, but more specifically the ideologies that created it (capitalism, imperialism), has been this way all along.\n\nNow I will attempt a hail mary and say that this all 'started' between 14,000 - 9,000 BCE when ideal flood plain conditions in the Mesopotamian alluvium created agricultural surpluses that resulted in the formation of 'the commons', cities and hierarchies. Hierarchies were formed out of a need to protect one's perceived 'property' or 'surplus'. This false perception of limited resources evolved into cultures of domination. Domination was codified by gender, religion, race, nation. Domination culture (known in the USA as self-determinism) would flourish and evolve from the ancient Assyrians all the way down to our modern day INJUSTICE system, passed along by theism, nationalism, and other isms. We have been building on disingenuous foundations for ten thousand years.",
