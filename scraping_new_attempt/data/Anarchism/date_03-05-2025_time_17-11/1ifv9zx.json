The Fediverse has already proven that decentralized structures can work: Mastodon is a serious alternative to Twitter, Odysee competes with YouTube. The key lies in combining decentralization with community-driven control. Successes are already visible\u2014for example, in combating alt-right and white supremacist movements, where individual instances deliberately block harmful content and accounts.\n\nBut one critical piece is still missing: a strong alternative to Twitch. Let\u2019s call it \u201cFediTwitch.\u201d This platform would need to fulfill two core tasks. First, users and communities must be able to de-federate hate speech and extremism through democratic votes\u2014effectively excluding them from the network. Second, it must provide secure revenue streams for independent, progressive, and leftist creators, free from reliance on ad algorithms or toxic sponsors. Crucially, creators would retain full control over their financial share. The platform itself would only use a transparent, collectively agreed-upon percentage\u2014allocated to technical infrastructure, basic operational costs, and promoting the project as a whole. This ensures money flows not into shareholder pockets, but directly into sustaining and amplifying an emancipatory alternative.\n\nThe risk is real: Unregulated platforms that reward algorithms or \u201ctestosterone-driven content\u201d inevitably fuel fascism. To prevent this, we need spaces that treat democratic values not as a fig leaf but as a foundational principle. Community moderation cannot be a luxury\u2014it must be technically and structurally embedded. Otherwise, we\u2019ll just repeat the mistakes of YouTube or Twitter.\n\nIch m\u00f6chte dies nur in die Diskussion geben.  \nIch entschuldige mich f\u00fcr Fehler, die ich von mir weise und beschuldige die KI.",
