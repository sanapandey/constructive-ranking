And a big part of that thought was how I no longer feel like that might be on the cards in the near future.\n\nSo that was kinda a bummer.",

            "body": "I've been going to ecstatic dance events since new years and they've been really profound for my self realisation and actualisation. Theres usually 25-40 or so people, the rules are no chit chat, no shoes, no technology and no substances, everything you need is already withing you. The space is so welcoming and people are encouraged to bring to the shared space whatever they need or want to bring, to feel however they feel and express however they want to express, that the space is there for you, you can proccess emotions and events whilst here, its oaky, we want you to get what you need essentially. We do a brief check in before, some guided body scan and let out some intuitive sounds, share mindful eey contact with all, share a ritualistic cacao drink, check in again at the end but other than that its just do as thou wilst, be thine self. Variety of tunes, tribal, house, latin, some absolutely skenk out tunes towards the end. Everyone is jsut themselves, and moving and exploring and sharing that space having a blast.\n\nI feel it's incredibly beautiful, ive never been a part of anything like it before my life and my self expression was so repressed and disconnected. Its taking me a little while to figure out how to dance, or how to learn how to dance but I really enjoy it, tapping into childhood and primal self, meeting my shadow, overcoming the fear to be myself, and be myself around and with other beings.\n\nI'm a male, tall, white, athletically built, there are typically expectations to who I am but in reality im this fearful creature that at 30 years old nearly has only begun learning who they are and how to love themselves instead of living in fear and pain and misery. Im taller than everyone at the events, i look different, i speak differently, I bring angsty masculine energy (because its what i've got at the forefront) to a space that has so much soft feminine energy so welcoming and nurturing, I had to get over the distaste for \"interjecting\" myself (bs) and trust the words of others there that I was oaky, that I'm wanted, accepted, and I put faith in their smiles, put faith in that maybe I was okay, and recently, when Ive been meeting and allowing myself, that masculine mask of fear and pain and anger slips off and away. The last event went hard witht he tunes towards the end, finger gun kinda bangers and I fully sent it full blast, then it drifted into 15 minute long serenade and I had none of my usual persona left. My movements were soft, I possesed some elegance I feel, and emotion was flowing through my graceful and mindful dancing, I was somewhere I'd never been, I was held and I was free.\n\nI felt magick, I felt such connection to myself for all those 15 or so minutes and then all of a sudden I was in bits, I was on the floor crying unable to stop myself sobbing, not wanting to stop myself! It was me meeting myself, my soft self, my queer self, the parts of me I learned I was NOT allowed to be growing up, I met those wounded parts in a space that only had open love for me and it was painful to feel that sorrow for myself and how I was taught I shouldnt love me, that it was hard to love me, of alllll the ways I numbed myself and deadned who I was, it was painful and uncomfrotable to have that release especially around other people in a place of joy but it was okay, and I'm so grateful to myself that I didnt stop that release, it was definitely needed. I'm so happy that my friend invited me, that I have this person in my life that im opening myself up to having love be a part of my life, love for others, for myself, from others. That I'm healing, growing into who I always was going to be. I fucking love who I am, of just how far I've come on my path.   \nBlessings to me, to you and to all x",
