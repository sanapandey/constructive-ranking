I realized they were right & they told me that the left wasn't just all authoritarianism. \n\nEdit: It wasn't just this, my homeless friend I tried to house died & I felt alienated from the right when the Trump frenzy began. When my friend died, I felt like part of me died, so I could look into things from the beginning. I didn't think it was right how the world treated him. I don't think homelessness should exist.\n\nSo I started investigating leftism a lot more deeply than I had been able to previously. I read anarchist texts. \n\nI like anarchism, but I am really studying this stuff, so I can't commit fully to any specific ideology. \n\nIn my heart, I am an anarchist. But I also have a mind, and I use it to evaluate the situation. \n\nI wish there could be an anarchist place in this world, but this world is full of evil people with bombs who love the oppression I hate.",

I prefer to call it libertarian communism in opposition to anarcho-capitalism. \nI live pretty isolated life and didn't meet any anarchists in years. It is hard to come by in your daily walkways of corporate employment places. But, that gives a good perspective on reality not being in a bubble of people sharing same ideas. My ideas need to be confronted and sell undercover to ordinary people who never heard about things like that. I like this kind of subversion. More people should do it.

I began falling into leftism, reading leftist theory and even the dreaded communist manifesto that had been so demonized in my youth. And I found I agreed with a lot of Marx's work after reading it. I began to fall into the communist camp before realizing that the authleft also has a big propaganda problem. After that realization, I became a lot more critical of information I came across and ended up talking to a lot more people of different political beliefs. I ended up realizing that I really like syndicalism and just libertarian leftism in general. I realized that not only is the welfare of all people important to me, but the civil liberties, freedom, and autonomy. So I sympathize a lot with anarchists now, especially after actually looking into anarchy. (Ancaps don't count)",

            "body": "  (As a preface, I'm going on like 3 hours of sleep, so I might sound way more incoherent than I think I do) \n\nI'd consider myself very sympathetic to anarchism but nowadays I hesitate to fully identify as one for a lot of complicated reasons. But I grew up with Baptist, conservative family. Can't remember exactly when I got sway from the right, but I think I started questioning everything I was taught when I saw a Stephen Hawking documentary that gave extremely good, credible evidence that young earth creationism was made up. After that I slowly drifted further left, was kind of a shitty basement dwelling autistic teenager, then realized I was a girl. I also grew up loving books and science fiction, and just tend to have a creative brain. A lot of that opened me up to the idea of what could be rather than what is or was - I saw things like climate change, homelessness, and our current system as a whole, and understood that it just can't last.  \n\nFor a long time as a younger adult (18ish to around 20?), I sort of identified as a communist, but didn't like the ideas of people like Stalin and Mao. So I'd just say \"I think i'm a communist, but I just don't like all of the authoritarian stuff.\" Then I learned about anarchism, and realized it matched pretty closely with my beliefs, and I ran with that for a while. Through that, I wanted to educate myself more about this sort of thing. I read more. I think George Orwell (specifically *Homage to Catalonia* and *Road to Wigan Pier*) was a big influence on my politics. He obviously wasn't perfect, but I appreciated that he always seemed to be willing to criticize himself and acknowledge pitfalls in the movements he supported, to engage in politics in good faith. It's not so much that I did or do agree with him on everything, more just that I really appreciated the *way* he went about trying to find solutions. And I also just think 1984 has really cool worldbuilding because it's based around the idea that the worldbuilding may or may not be real at all. And without being the \"this is literally 1984!!\" person, I think he did do a really good job of exploring a post truth world considering how AI and social media work today.  \n\nI think Christian anarchism/civil rights movements have also had a good influence on me, despite me being agnostic-ish. Oliver Snow (who's an actual, literal anarcho-communist) from tiktok (currently going by Preacher from the Black Lagoon) exposed me to some great ideas, and I've always appreciated his well thought out takes. John Brown is somebody I've always admired, even if he wasn't technically an anarchist. I admire that he was willing to lay down his life for an issue that would never have affected him, in a time where the idea that black individuals were seen as less-than compared to whites, even by most abolishionists, dominated western culture.  \n\nOh, also, folk music corrupted me. I love people like Pete Seeger and Phil Ochs.\n\nWith all of this said, I've also always tended to be a very careful, change-averse person (blame my autism, I guess). And I personally feel like a HUGE cultural shift is needed for anarchism to \"work\" in the US - where the idea of even taking public transit is seen as \"gross\". Like I said, I'd consider myself to be very sympathetic. But working in adult foster care, where people will cut every corner and neglect every person at every turn if given the opportunity, combined with me watching how a lot of left leaning movements have just left trans people and other minorities in the dust has made me feel like the state (or at least some form of rule and regulation) can have some benefit if it's used more as a watchdog than a hierarchy in the event that culture fails to protect the most vulnerable members of society. Also wanted to add - the idea that culture CAN (nor necessarily WILL) de facto replace law/the state within a hierarchy in the same way that the state can replace capitalism under vanguard socialism. was one of my main ideas that I got thinking about after reading The Dispossessed.",

It wasn't until I talked to another friend who was indeed an Anarchist, that I really began to open my eyes.\n\n My permanent distrust of a state, all authority (I was always an independent and critical thinker) and capitalist politics was always \"there\" in a sense, I just needed someone to explain to me what I was actually upset with, and gave me the tools and ideas so that I could come to my own conclusions. Since then I have formed a strong bond with Anarchism. Operating under its principles I have done more for my family, my community, and its framework has given me insights on how I should live my life, and what battles to fight.",

            "body": "A lot of little moments pushed me towards anarchism. At those times, I didn't realize what was happening, but now things make more sense.\n\nI always knew I didn't want to work a job. I already hated school even though I was compliant and didn't put up a fuss about it. I saw work as an extension of that, and I couldn't really justify why I had to do either. The only thing I noticed was that if you didn't work, you would die, because the things you need to survive are locked behind a paywall. That didn't seem right to me, but I'd grown up with a lot of sayings like, \"an idle mind is the devil's workshop,\" and \"there's no food for a lazy man.\"\n\nAs I continued my education journey, I realized I really hated school, and at this point, I was very aware that I was being sent through this pipeline where I would come out the other end as a worker. I still didn't think there was any alternative, though. Had I voiced my concerns, I'd have been called lazy or disrespectful, so I didn't say anything.\n\nThen, there came the time when I was done with secondary school and I got admission into university. COVID hit, and during that time, I began to rethink a lot of stuff. I was heavy into streaming my gameplay then, and I really wanted to do that because I enjoyed it. However, there was always the looming threat of school. At the same time, I started to realize that I could learn basically anything I wanted as well, if only I had Internet access. So, I tried to drop out, but my parents weren't having it. I was ridiculed and told that I would be forever be looked down on if I didn't get my degree. Really, that was the only thing they could tell me, and that didn't sit right with me at all. That I could be very capable to perform a job, but because I didn't have some piece of paper, I could be passed over. Not only that, but no one could actually even tell me that it was a guarantee that I would get a job with that paper. This was really fucking important information because we have just established that if you don't work, you don't eat. So, there's a huge issue if you can spend so much time and money 'getting an education\" and still not have a job which is supposed to keep you alive. And again, why aren't these things free in the first place?\n\nThen, I began to question what education was actually for, and I realized that what I had been led to believe was education was just meant to make people obedient. It wasn't actual learning. I was surprised to learn that actual learning can be fun. I was surprised to learn how school had managed to drain all the life from the most interesting subjects. I wondered why I needed to suck up to authority every single time. I knew my teachers weren't always right and that they were being abusive towards me, but I still had to have this whole \"respect\" thing because they were older than me. This, of course, meant that they \"knew better.\"\n\nThen a couple more stuff happened over the course of the next few years, and I recently only started identifying as an anarchist when I realized that I wasn't actually crazy for wanting any of the things I wanted. When I realized that there were smart people that had similar thoughts to me, I was elated. I was basically already an anarchist in everything but name. The last piece of the puzzle was really understanding that I couldn't live on my own and that I had to depend on other people. This was the last thing to fall in place because the current systems really do try to make you feel like you don't need anyone. There's a lot of hyper-individualist self-help stuff out there that fails to touch on community in any meaningful way. If it does, it's mostly in the context of networking, which is something that I hate doing because I associate the action with fakeness.\n\nAnyways, now, I am trying to learn as much as I possibly can and contribute to the journey towards anarchy in ways that I can.",

I would have been considered a \"Left Nazi\", someone who believed in state socialism, but only for white people. Then I ended up homeless and realized that I had fallen for the worst kind of propaganda that had been reinforced by the racism in my family. \n\nI became a communist, but I didn't vibe with the historical revisionism of so many communists about the USSR as a whole and Stalin in particular. I had an anthropology professor from Romania who told us of how she fled the USSR after getting tipped off that she was being investigated for attempts to form a labor union. She told us that while she had supported the idea, she had never spoken to anyone about it and was too afraid to do so. She wasn't a conservative or a reactionary, but still after decades in the US believed in socialism. She also told us of being forced to learn Russian and the attempts to destroy Romanian history and culture.   \n  \nThen I worked with an Armenian man who had left just before the fall, because he \\*had\\* tried to form a union with his fellow engineers and workers. He watched the police arrive at his apartment as he and his family got into a car with US State Department officials down the block.   \n  \nSo I was a communist, but I feared the authoritarian power of communist governments of the past. Then I began to listen to Behind the Bastards because I recognized the name of the host from [Cracked.com](http://Cracked.com) and found that I agreed with the vast majority of the host Robert Evans takes. They are generally nuanced and as the show went on and he gained a following he more openly admitted to not being a liberal, but an anarchist. He did an episode on Nestor Makhno and so I began reading about Nestor and then generally about more and more anarchists and their thoughts, but i still considered myself a communist. Then Mike Duncan did the Russian Revolution as part of his Revolutions podcast and presented the communists and anarchists in the most positive light I have ever seen a liberal portray them. I began reading Bakunin and was calling myself an Anarchist, but the final nail in the coffin came from a friend asking a bunch of us what we would do with absolute power. He meant it in a joking way expecting joke answers, but for some reason the question resonated with me and I realized what I would do and how far I would go to change the world. I decided then and there that power was dangerous and that no one should have it, because if I couldn't trust myself not to commit atrocities in the name of the greater good, then I could not trust anyone to do so.",

I had no idea what I was about to watch. I misinterpreted the description I guess. I think this was the real beginning of my questioning established systems. When I eventually became pregnant, I knew I wasn't going to do a hospital birth. That immediately put me in the community of non conventional people. It exposed me to Attachment Parenting style. I liked the idea but wasn't sure it was practical in the long run because I was super religious at the time. \n\nSomeone suggested I read \"Unconditional Parenting\" by Alfie Kohn. This is what really set me on the path of anarchy (it prepped me for it). The book is all about case studies and statistics that prove that punishment doesn't improve behavior. I realized that this has to be true for adults as well, meaning the prison system is fundamentally flawed. I basically became libertarian at this point.\n\nNot long after I was exposed to the concept of unschooling. This just seemed perfect. I started following an unschooling page on Facebook and the creator happened to be an anarchist. He talked a lot about anarchy in addition to parenting. Almost everything he said made sense so I moved toward minarchy. I wasn't quite ready to completely write off government. \n\nThen one day, that guy posted a comment something like this: People who are afraid of anarchy are afraid of wars and destruction and murders, ect... But all these things are happening now with governments in place. \n\nThat did it for me. I became an anarchist after reading that comment.

So I wanted to contribute.\n\nTo start with, when I was very, very young, I bought into American propaganda as I'm sure a lot of people do, and I was also raised very Christian. That lead to believing in the principles that are espoused by those two things, like individual freedom, all people are created equal, this country is made of immigrants, empathy is good, we should be trying to help others as much as possible, love your neighbor, etc. etc. All the good things those two concepts supposedly stand for. I was also very curious from a young age and particularly enjoyed history and would ask my parents lots of questions that lead into political discussions in elementary school. They specifically very much encouraged intellectual curiosity and critical thinking.\n\nSo when I reached middle school, I was already more or less a progressive democrat in theory, although it would take some further thought on specific key issues to realize I wasn't still a little republican like I thought I was in elementary school. Even in middle school, I enjoyed thinking about politics and would pay attention to American politics. I could see the obvious bald-faced lies from republicans, but it really bothered me *a lot* that democrats would also very clearly lie and dance around issues, so I was already feeling, even in middle school, that clearly democrats are also not capable of solving anything. Somewhere during this, I lost my belief in Christianity, but its only relevance here is that this caused a massive shift in my thinking because if this massive part of my life wasn't true, what else was I taught to believe that I simply believe because I was taught to? Even to this day though, I still think the fundamental teachings of Jesus are profound and good. I'd generally categorize that as radical empathy, care, and a want to help others.\n\nThen, in 9th grade, I had a global history class. Yes, very nebulous class, but our teacher at some point started teaching us about the Russian revolution. He started us off by introducing two key concepts to the Russian revolution, Marx and feminism. I can't remember much about what he specifically said but I just remembering thinking wow, for something that's supposedly big, bad, and scary, this Marx guy makes a lot of sense. The only thing I remember well is when our teacher turned to a slide that just said \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\", and I thought, that's it, that's my politics wrapped up into a nice little package and wrapped with a bow. A few days or a week later, we discussed feminism and our teacher told us it fundamentally is the belief that women are equals and I thought yes, that's obvious and self evident. My teacher at the time wasn't completely forthcoming with his own political beliefs, but looking back, he was obviously a huge anarchist, so when I told him I was a communist, he encouraged that but also pointed me towards Emma Goldman and a few other anarchist women (I can't remember who else at the moment, though).\n\nSo that's how I became a leftist in general. The final leap to anarchism took years, though. I joined leftist spaces on reddit and generally read a lot of apologia for Stalin, Mao, etc. But I always had the thought in the back of my head that clearly, atrocities they committed *did* happen, and the only debate that could be had was exactly how bad they were, not if they existed. I'm really simplifying this part, but I debated in my head for *years* whether or not I could overlook all that, because I do think then, as I still do now, that educating the working class is a really really tough problem to solve, but is fundamental to even beginning to leave the capitalist structure behind. Finally, one day, it clicked that out of the big three leftist dictators, the only one I even kind of trusted was actually going anywhere with communism was Castro, and it's not like he has a squeaky clean record. He just wasn't a *complete* and utter failure of a leftist. I mean, Stalin and Mao both did absolutely nothing to move their societies towards communism, unless you count the admittedly monumental shifts in the economies of their respective country's away from feudalism/feudalism adjacent to capitalism. But even then, if you agree with Marx, this would've happened one way or another, so that is largely inconsequential, meaning they pretty much did nothing to move their societies towards a completely equitable communist society.\n\nThere was a lot of reading about anarchism during these years, that disspelled the \"absolutely no rules at all\" myth, and about the history of actual anarchist societies, etc. Finally, I just realized that I've always had a problem with anyone having power in the first place, and it seemed to me that leftists are susceptible to the same pitfalls of power, so I decided that it ultimately wasn't worth having an overarching authority to transform the thinking of a society in order to facilitate socialism if it can so easily be taken over and steered away from that goal indefinitely.\n\nSo, to sum up, I was taught empathy, kindness, and freedom are good things, and took that to the logical end point. And I came to believe that it's important to question anything I believe that I only believe because I always have, which includes believing any authority has merit, if I have not been shown why. Those fundamental points make anarchism the only compatible ideology, although I have severe doubts that it's achievable within our lifetimes. \n\nBut, in the words of Rage Against the Machine, another massive influence in my younger years towards anarchism, it has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime. What better place than here? What better time than now?",
