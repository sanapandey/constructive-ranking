    "selftext": "I've had this thought; people HATE mainstream media nowadays. I'm talking liberals, fascists, hell it's somehow managed to piss the entire left off. Many people point to Fox, WSJ, NYT and other dominant news sources for their direct role in \"sanewashing\" fascists, presenting horrible, democracy-ending news as normal, and generally just being propaganda. \n\nSee, the usual workaround to the liberal propaganda in recent years was independent journalism or just direct information on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram sorta and other online platforms, or relying on Google algorithms to promote their websites. The issue now is that those platforms have basically decided to censor everything that doesn't suck on fascist cock, so nobody is able to get their usual news from crowdsources or whatever. People are actually listening to local news and national news with fresh ears and finding it to be distasteful.\n\nThere is a demand in the general public for honest, truthful news about shit, and they aren't getting it online. They aren't getting it in their current newspapers either. Anarchists have done much work to get their message out but censorship and state repression of our ideas has blocked the reach of our ideas for many years. I propose a solution: \n\nPrint media! \n\nZines, posters, fliers, and even established papers such as Slingshot. Make them and spread them around! Hand them out to people while tabling on college campuses. Staple fliers to telephone poles. Throw out pointless bourgeois magazines from those \"free\" things and replace them with propaganda! \n\nI think the most important thing here is to remember to bring some proper journalism along with you. Write an essay about the actions going on in DC. Write about the truth of fascist deregulation causing deadly aviation accidents. Write protest reports! If you gain the public trust, you gain their ears. It's far easier to deprogram normies and liberals when they actually enjoy reading your shit",

But first we have to spread the word and keep repeating everywhere that the media doesn't represent us and social media is silencing us.",
