We just finished the fifth and next month we will discuss the book as a whole and decide where we're going next. \n\nWe have found that beginning our discussions with heart meditation helps us be more present and kind with each other.\n\nThe book, if you don't know it already, is a profound exploration of slavery and colonialism, gender and sexuality, and the capacity to transform relationships at every level. It is a beautiful book and every bit as important as The Dispossessed. Highly recommended!",
