Coming soon I believe our concept of everything will shift from back to a Non-dual system just like the global indigenous always knew. That kind of system is the only way Anarchism can work. \nAnd it doesn\u2019t even have to be a spiritual idea if that scares you. There is science supporting it and you can go as materialist we are in a simulation as you want. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree but when you are ready the answers exist.",

We are now collectively suffering because of that. \n\nI don\u2019t see any big changes happening without a spiritual revolution. Any other revolutions that occur before that will end the same way every revolution before that has. With blood and corruption. \n\nAnd don\u2019t be confused. Spiritual does not mean religious.

At the same time, it's a period of uncertainty for a lot of us, with regard to what we should be talking about, if we are talking at all, in online forums, so maybe a little patience is called for as well.",

Much of the anarchist movement struggles really to have a good sense of what anarchism even is and we're at a point where most of the people who call themselves anarchists are still clarifying what it is they believe in or want (and whether \"anarchism\" is the right term for it).\n\nFor me, it isn't surprising that there is as much activity. Perhaps the conversation about anarchism is more meta right now or about anarchism itself rather than about its application (i.e. /r/anarchism)? Don't know if that makes sense.",

Briefly, I concede the point that, if a state is, *by definition,* a gang *that does unjust things* like use arbitrary violence against people, then states should uncontroversially be abolished. But, I don't know that you would actually want to define states in this way. First, this definition trivializes political anarchism because everyone agrees that you should get rid of an institution that is, by definition, unjust. Second, it means that if, say, the US government suddenly stopped acting unjustly\u2014e.g., it started using violence only in just ways such as by stopping fascist violence\u2014it would no longer qualify as a state, which is counterintuitive. Finally, it also means that gangs that do things like collect protection money or drive-by shootings would also qualify as states, which is also counterintuitive. So, I think it's actually a lot harder to distinguish between states and gangs than you might think!\n\nAgain, this is pretty quick; the chapter goes into much greater depth. That's why it would be nice if people had been given the opportunity to actually read the chapter's arguments and judge for themselves rather than a mod deciding in advance that the position I defend is so heterodox it doesn't even merit discussion. (And, of course, this is just one chapter of the book; the other six argue extensively against the legitimacy of the state and private property while defending egalitarianism and people's rights against bodily interference).",

I said that a state requires your submission to it in order for you to exist on the territory it claims, unlike gangs, which are frequently ambivalent towards unaffiliated people in their territory, or at worst, are running a protection racket but otherwise uninterested in how you live your life. If I'd actually made the claim that a state was just a gang that does unjust things, then I'd have to conclude, as you said, that most gangs are, in fact, states. I made no claim either way as to whether the justice or injustice of an entity's actions is what defines it as a state. You made that up entirely because you're trying to defend the unanarchist positions that a) such a thing as a \"just\" state can even exist, and b) that a \"just\" state does not need to be abolished.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n* The justice or injustice of an organisation is not what defines it as a state. There are plenty of unjust organisations that have nothing to do with states, and sometimes states do a justice\n\n* What defines a state is the requirement of fealty and obedience from everyone living in the geographic area it claims, and the holding of the exclusive right to enact violence within that geographic area\n\n* This requirement to submit and the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence is why we oppose states as anarchists, despite what \"good\" a hypothetical state might otherwise do",

Perhaps the idea is that what makes the state distinctly objectionable is that it *asserts* that it has a special right to govern its subjects and monopolize force? In other words, it maintains that it has this special moral status to oblige us that, of course, we as anarchists reject. And that is what makes the state objectionable. Is that the idea?\n\nIf it is, then you're proposing the fifth proposed account of a state that I consider (and reject) in the linked chapter.

            "body": "A lot of people talking about reddit/subreddit-focused reasons here, and I'm not saying there's no truth to that, but no one seems to be mentioning the fact is that a lot of the radical left's energy that was directed towards Anarchism or at least \"anarcho-curious\"-ness has really fallen off and directed towards other left/socialist/progressive tendencies in recent years. It's not just the sub, Anarchism itself and anarchist ideas/thinkers are a lot less prominent in the anglophone left than previously. \n\nI think a big part of this is that failures (or perceived failures) in more decentralized and \"spontaneous order\" focused movements and groups in the 2010s and early 20s worldwide have led people who are looking for radical change to start to gravitate towards more hierarchical organizing principles and organizational forms, because of the idea that they can be more resilient, move more nimbly in response to changing circumstances, and be more resistant to co-optation or obstruction by outside agitators, media campaigns, and other hostile forces.  Organizations where in principle everyone has an equal voice and right to be heard, and where all actions are supposed to be taken through consensus, are much much easier to disrupt if you have nefarious reasons for doing so, especially if that movement or organization starts to grow/scale (or not scale, as the case may be).\n\nVincent Bevins writes about this in his most recent book \"if we burn\", focusing a lot on the mass mobilization in Brazil in the 2010s, and how anarchist/libertarian socialist etc. groups that started a protest wave were pretty comprehensively replaced once the movement started to pick up steam, and were unable to defend themselves against co-optation once their desired goal of generating mass participation had been achieved. (leading to the ultimately to, rather than a movement to galvanize progressive change, the overthrow of a hugely imperfect but nevertheless social democratic government with a reactionary/authoritarian right one, the radical left being wiped out and buried, and something that came very close to the end of Brazilian democracy, with the aid of US foreign intervention, primarily through lawfare)\n\nAnd in the Anglosphere OWS is a classic example of a protest movement that sprung up when anarcho-curiosity was at its absolute height, and it's kind of impossible to litigate the plusses and minuses here, but there is certainly a _perception_ (whether fair or unfair) among a lot of the left that its consensus based libertarian leaderless structureless (or, at least, what non-anarchists would call structureless, a lot of \"spontaneous\" structure notwithstanding) is what led to both its aimlessness/listlessness (i.e., never managing to coalesce among a specific set of demands, but lots and lots of endless discussion and debate) and its lack of resilience once it was ultimately faced with the (inevitable) violence of the state.  OWS and other more structureless (perhaps it's better to say less rigid and/or less hierarchical) movements, especially protest movements, of the 2010s were anarchism's big moment in the sun. And to many, that sunlight highlighted a lot of the inherent problems and weaknesses with strictly anarchist organizing principles, if your movement or group wants to scale beyond numbers in the 10s or 100s.  \n\nMore recently, BLM and its ultimate lack of concrete victories, an almost unprecedented amount of public energy and revolutionary potentially directed to... what exactly? What material gain?  Again, BLM was not for the most part an explicitly anarchist movement, but its characteristic (of the 2010s) lack of official structure, its polycentricism, it's focus on public energy and participation but without any concrete guiding organizational structure/principle; and its subsequent cooptation by liberal identity politics, corporations, and grifters, and complete lack of resilience in the face or right-wing campaigns against it - in diagnosing the causes of the movement's ultimate failures, a lot of other left tendencies have a lot stronger and more concrete answers about it than what anarchist has to offer. Many people view a movement like that as, retrospectively, having been doomed to fail from the moment it was born, specifically because of a lack of organization structure, message discipline (and outright behavior discipline), causing it to do a whole lot of wheel spinning, and that ultimately the discipline and focus needed to purpose it into something much more impactful can only come from some degree of _hierarchical_ organizational principle.  (not saying I necessarily buy that, but that's the line).\n\nAnd let's be honest with ourselves, a lot of anarchist and/or libertarian socialist type people have, for a long time, been so focused on moments of spontaneous explosive energy, with the idea that that is really all that is needed (or most of what is needed), to affect change. If you stir up the the public, and really get a lot of people enthused, activated, out there, angry, ready for change, then with only a little nudge here and there, spontaneous order will cause the masses to coalesce into something really powerful, that really starts to change things. \n\nI think a lot of people still active on /r/anarchism would no longer take such a na\u00efve view of social change, and I'm sure than many never did, but we can't deny that that sort of feeling, the raw enthusiasm about the _something_ happening out there on the streets, and being a part of it, and just knowing, this is it, this is really gonna lead to something, that has been hugely present in the anarchist tendencies of activist left and online left for quite a while. And, well, the last decade or so has shown that, actually, no, in a modern world with modern media ecosystems and very organized entrenched power systems (state bureaucracies of course but also private power), no, that actually isn't enough at all. And worse than that, it even has the potential to make things worse; public fervor can be just as easily directed to reactionary and regressive ends as it can progressive ones, and if you abdicate the driving seat due to principled opposition to hierarchical forms, you're kind of leaving it open for the organized forces of stagnation and reaction to take it.\n\nAnd look, I'm not saying there are no answers to these issues to be found from anarchists or the anarchist tradition. I'm sure there are, maybe some will reply to give me some. But the flavor of left-anarchism that was dominant (perhaps not hegemonic, but certainly very influential) in the 2010s didn't really have good answers to those questions.  Don't get me wrong, I still love David Graeber, and miss him dearly, but as a provocateur, a critic, and a visionary for what a better world could look like, I love him. As a strategist, someone outlining how to get there, I think a lot of his ways of talking about that stuff ring pretty hollow after the last decade or so of world events, or at least come across as na\u00efve or lacking. (That doesn't mean there is not a lot of value there)\n\nThe Chomskyian flavor of anglosphere anarchism, which comes across as more moderate and pragmatic (abolish \"unjust\" hierarchies, but be pragmatic in the face of what existing power structures there are in the world and that you must fight against, and factor that in to what a \"justifiable\" hierarchical structure looks like) seems much more practical as an organizing principle than David Graeber / OWS-type and/or \"me and my 12 friends in an urban squat commune\" type stuff. But it also starts to look less and less like actual \"anarchism\" too, or at least, further and further from what self-identified anarchists accept as legitimate. And, if you take it in its broadest sense, as a general organising principle, is something that pretty much all socialist tendencies (even authoritarian ones) at least nominally adhere to, in that they argue that whatever hierarchies they do endorse _are_ the necessary/justified ones . (And then disagreement then becomes not one of principle, but over what is or is not a justified hierarchical institution or structure.)\n\nThere's only so far you can take that without getting silly of course, and the core principle that anyone should be able to _demand_ of a power structure: \"justify yourself\" actually still is quite a radical one that most hierarchical institutions do not actually abide by, but my point is that, even if you do, you can start to get quite far from what any true anarchist would really regard as being \"their people\". (Chomsky, despite his Anarchist philosophy, was a big supporter of universal public programs for instance, because of their role in a word dominated by the power structures of corporate capitalism). If part of your politics involves defending universal public programmes, looking for things like state-funded healthcare, education etc., you're pretty far from anything that most anarchists are comfortable with. And, conversely, if your anarchism is more of a theoretical thing to ponder about and imagine implementing in a future society that doesn't really apply to present organization then, eh, people aren't very interested in that either.  Similarly, the idea that you start small, building your commune, your squat, your mutual aid group, your antifa cell etc., on the ground, along anarchist principles, with the idea that somehow that can and will scale to something society wide given the right conditions? I think that's pretty much gone as a dream from the vast majority of the left too; because if you're not part of some much wider society wide nationally organized movement that is disciplined and strategic, and can move as a mass, then the state, and capital, can just squash you like a bug.",

That does not appear to be where the energy is any more.  The students participating in those protests and encampments had **clear** understandings of a \"party line\" so to speak; some things are up for debate, many things are not. And similarly, their media strategies ultimately reflected this also; whenever some journo (with a few exceptions of those known to be friendly) picked off a random protestor at the encampment to ask for their views, reasoning for being there, their goals, their thoughts/feelings about the movement or the encampment, their response was almost invariably - you'll have to speak to the press officer. Occasionally to give a pre-approved calculated message decided by the structure.\n\nThis \"message discipline\" is almost Leninist-like in its dedication to the idea of something like a party line. Okay, maybe that's too strong, but it's very against what anarchist (or anarchist-lite) organizing principles seen commonly throughout 2010s protest movements would have you do.  If you join a Palestine encampment, your view is absolutely **not** equal to someone who has been in the movement longer that you, and certainly not someone in an organizing role who is above you in the hierarchy. You do **not** have a right for your thoughts and views to be taken into account as much as anyone else when it comes to public messaging and political positioning, and if you don't like that, and aren't willing to conform to the discipline structure of the camp, then you will be escorted from the premises.\n\nI'm not meaning to make a value judgement here, about whether this is a good thing, and I am also certainly oversimplifying too, but I think there is truth to the idea that Anarchism is simply not where the energy is in the Anglosphere left at the moment, in the way that it was 5-10 years ago.  Although I do think that a lot of the lessons and principles of Anarchist thinkers and movements have had influence and lasting impact on progressive organizations & movements today.",

Yes looking at successes and building on them and looking at failures and coming up with viable corrections. This constructive and sythesizi g effort to find the best pracrices of freedom is what anarchism is. It is not some moribund ideology created in the past to be repeated over and over on the future. We must create and recreate our 21st century anarchism vased on lived experience of past and present informed by science, creativity and as what always comes with it scincere intuition.",
