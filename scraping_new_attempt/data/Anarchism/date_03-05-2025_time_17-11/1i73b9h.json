Media expected the American public to be outraged about the assassination, but most celebrated it or were ambivalent about it.",

I know it's an old article so I assume they weren't worried about the same things as me nowadays, but I feel like that kind of phrasing might put a lot of pressure unto people too, in a way? capitalism makes work a pain, but I think few people are actually interested in doing nothing... I just think we can make it more enjoyable for everyone instead of \"forcing\" people into being workers, if that makes sense.",
