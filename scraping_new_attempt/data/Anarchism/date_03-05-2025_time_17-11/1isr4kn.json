Maybe true freedom isn\u2019t about fighting the system, but realizing how deep its influence runs within you.",

You can't say you don't have an ideology if you categorically don't believe anything about anything, because not believing anything about anything is also an ideology.\n\n\nAll social groups have written and unwritten rules for how the groups operate. Anarchy is accepting that those rules need to be examined, tested, that they need to change to accommodate new situations, and literally fought when systems are set up to harm (like redlining). But it's not an \"un free\" thing to have rules in general for the group to ensure fairness. The fighting comes from trying to get on the same page with people with what they consider fair for everyone, since a lot of people consider \"everyone\" to be \"just me\".\n\n\nI guess living alone in the middle of the woods forever would relieve you of some of that, but like... you'd still be living according to your own set of values. You'd just be living without the responsibility of considering the other people in your group. And you'd still be benefitting from the actions and rules of groups of people you're not part of.",

As a side note, I think that's the main reason why the 2nd Matrix film included the often-criticised twist with \"the Architect\" - to engage with the ways in which breaking free from the system can sometimes just be \"another means of control\".\n\nWhat we can do is become more practiced in the skill of recognising our influences. That way, we can re-examine our beliefs, especially as we acquire new information, instead of holding them uncritically. We can have a skill of changing what we think when that appears the right thing to do.\n\nIt is also good to be cautious of anyone promising you a path to free thinking - because yeah, they're usually selling you on their grift and not offering a path to your own true agency. There's a difference between someone showing you your options, and telling you they have the entire right path for you to follow.",

Anarchism is rot as a political theory if we do not include at the centre a philosophical and individual core, self-determination and ethical-individualism. \n\nReal anarchists imo are building separate communities, social networks with people they trust to have their back. They give a fuck about visible political action, as they dont want to draw attention to their own world. This is escaping the system in a constructive way.",

Knowing the laws of physics and aerodynamics people learned to take flight.\nYou would not escape a jail cell by simply understanding the system, its walls, its history and your fears and prejudices that stand in your way of daring to escape it. You size it up and you find the gaps, find the allies, and strategize to get as free as you can. If it is digging dig. If is it is organizing organize. If you must write to act far beyond the cell  and gain allies to change things, do that.  If it is exercise and meditation and self reflection to control yourself, to better do what must be done, do that.
