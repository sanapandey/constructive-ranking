If the government is removing all of our services, grants, federal aid, raising our taxes and tariffs, closing all government departments that actually protect our health and safety, ending the department of education and using our money to fund a military to threaten other peaceful countries, then what am I getting out of paying my taxes?  What if we just collectively\u2026..didn\u2019t?  If you\u2019re owed money back, then by all means, get your refund, but if you owe?  Or alternately, do with the billionaires do, and claim so many ridiculous exemptions that you owe $0. What would happen if this were the next protest movement?  ",

            "body": "A few quotes from Thoreau's essay Civil Disobedience, written in the mid 19th century:\n\n\"Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support, are ... the most serious obstacles to reform.\"\n\n\"Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.\"\n\n\"It is not a man's duty to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; ... but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and not to give it practically his support.\"\n\n\"If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. ... When the subject has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is accomplished.\"\n\n(When he says 'man' he means 'people'). It's kinda funny how in the conventional mind Henry David Thoreau is thought of as an honored American. During his day he wasn't popular, but today his name is well known. Unfortunately it seems not many today have read his writings. \n\nHopefully this helps us think about what we can do today when faced with taxes. Thoreau refused to pay taxes and went to jail, but just for one night because someone paid his tax for him. It's not an easy problem to solve once we know what we know.",
