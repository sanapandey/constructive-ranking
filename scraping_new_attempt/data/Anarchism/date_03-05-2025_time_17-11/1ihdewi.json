I would say in the nearly year that\u2019s followed, it hasn\u2019t aged well. \n\nTo my recollection, nobody who actually knew Aaron Bushnell has ever come forward to co-sign this Internet sleuthing. Nobody who interacted with him and was close to him has ever said, \u201cYes, they confessed to me they\u2019d always had these feelings,\u201d etc., etc. \n\nBushnell being a cis man who was supportive of trans rights in ways few cis men are is speculation that feels particularly hollow when discussing someone so deeply committed to Palestinian rights and opposing the horrors his government was unleashing against them that he self-immolated live on camera. That would seem to indicate a tremendous capacity for empathy and justice even for people *unlike* himself. \n\nAnd maybe I\u2019m just from a different generation, but I remember when the anonymity of the Internet was sort of the whole point. You obfuscated your identity plus got to be a different person by logging on to pretend to be someone else until you logged off. *Some* people definitely did that to explore gender feelings, but it certainly wasn\u2019t exclusively that or even typically that. \n\nThe last thing is that I just can\u2019t imagine why with so little actual evidence you would do a piece like this on someone who states so unequivocally who they were and why they were doing what they did in a final testament. \n\nI generally like Assigned Media, but it\u2019s been almost a year since this came out, and I have not seen this piece age any better in terms of additional information about Bushnell that came out from everyone else actually in his life.",

They don't seem to have been based in much reality, mostly his screenname and a post he made in admiration of trans comrades, but they were a big part of what people ended up talking about.",
