    "selftext": "So I have been wondering, and would love some off your takes on this (also I want to make clear that this is not a call to violence but a general hypothetical concern);\nIf, in the next years to come, a war breaks out (I live in germany and it is sadly possible in the next 5 years approx.), will there be anarchist partisan groups or movements like free territories (even in a similar fashion to the makhnovtchina possibly?) and just in general militant \"no nation\" groups fighting? \nI'd be interested in your opinions and ideas especially about Europe, because the mentality on that (and the possibilities regarding pew pews) is very different in the US and i.e. Germany/generally Europe.\nPS: For example, I know that there are several of such groups fighting in russia and ukraine and belarus right now.\n",

But I imagine if anything happens, it will be very simmilar to situation in Ukraine. Drone warfare and jamming technologies will drastically improve and play major role in urban fights due to small availability of guns. As for partisant organizations, it does feel like there will be many smaller groups or even lone fighters however I don't know if any bigger groups will form.\n\nUSA however, I don't know mentality of people living there, but situation here feels less stable than Europe. It's hard for me to say what could happen if war broke out there.\n\nThese are my loose thoughts, nothing serious and I'm not very well informed about warefare and politics",

The collective national opinion of Russia isn't high so there would be fear on a level I can't really predict but not so much opposition as there would be if we went to war with Canada or Mexico. Canada and Mexico are historic allies of the US and the average American has a positive view of Canada and most centrist and left leaning individuals have a pretty positive view of Mexico too. In that case, there would definitely be regions and militant groups that try to split off and resist the US, successfully or not I don't know. One of the most major differences in this situation is the number of firearms involved.",
