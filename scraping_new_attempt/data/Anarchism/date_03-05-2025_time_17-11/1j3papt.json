Contrast them to fascists and other groups, e.g. ethnonationalists, who wish to empower the state, perhaps without limit (yes I recognize Rothbard was a white supremacist).\n\nOn the left, there are some who wish to exterminate or otherwise permanently suppress those who would become former rulers in a new society. In other words, they're somewhere between authoritarian leftist and Neo-Jacobin.",
