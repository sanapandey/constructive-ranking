Most people out there don't or won't have experience with being out there and dont really know what to do in a lot of situations.   Share pamphlets, advice, be charismatic, organize, bring attention to stuff that will get people mad, hand out pamphlets, tell people they should stand here to block off this road or there to block off that one, be an anarchist.  Protests are anarchists loudest microphone.\n\nIt's kind of a vague and in-the-know term right now, though, like 'fedjacketing'.\n\n(it also has a use in unions which it originated in which I am less personally familiar with, but basically means a union member getting a job at a place in order for the union to communicate with the workers, agitate them, and encourage them to unionize and use labor power)",

As anarchists our tactics are naturally pretty immune to feds and too decentralized for any of them to have any real effect.  Obviously, there really are underground police, but throwing cop at someone who you think is suspicious without any evidence is dangerous and could dissolve the whole moment you're in.  As a matter of fact, underground cops will often fedjacket other people.  Newton towards the end of his life had isolated himself from other revolutionaries our of fear they might be police.  Protect urself against underground cops by being decentralized and spontaneous.",

This isn't a woman's rights protest, it's general protests without an explicit leader.  Historically, decentralized, spontaneous action is what's going to naturally happen in response to what's happening right now.  It's also the most effective strategy.  When and where are anarchists supposed to step up if not here?  It's very possible liberals completely let the energy they have slip by and produce no change.  When that happened in Germany it didn't proceed well.\n\nSaying \"I listen to Black organizers at a BLM protest\" is great, until you start thinking about the fact Black organizers are not spokesmen for a unified group.  There is no manager of women.  There is no leader of black people for you to listen to.  Did you know its possible for Black people or women to be anarchists?  There's whole ideological strains around it!  Who do you listen to when two black organizers at a BLM march give you conflicting orders?  \n\nPersonally, I try to choose how I act and what I do at a protest off principle and practicality.  It's all you can do.  I have my code, and I have what I know might work\n\nYou know how you can really be an ally?  stop being an ally, become an accomplice.",

The state *will* crackdown on liberals.  Our job is to tell them, be there to try and help the ones who continue learn what to do, and go \"IIII TOLDDD YOUUUUUU SOOOOOO\" as much as possible and as publicly as possible afterward. \n\nUnfortunately, the state and capital have a much wider net in terms of controlling the public \"conversation\".  Usually, in my experience, once a protest stops and the media/social media picks it up, the right completely controls the narrative.  I remember one night coming home, red from rubber bullets and tear gas, after being a street medic, and my media-illiterate, liberal father telling me it didn't happen, even when I showed him the bruises.  News, social media, and \"influencer\" media lives in a reality that's just fundementally different than the people who were actually there and saw it ourselves, and I have never been able to change a liberals mind that wasn't there.  Still, we need to grab as many as we can from the pool of people who live in reality and are actually there.\n\nWe need more anarchists, really badly.  No matter how clandestine or guerilla our tactics get, or how many forms of mutual aid we establish, there's not enough of us, and non-anarchists/fellow travelers provide even less than us.  I wonder if anarchists will ever manage to have a real chance at sharing our ideas to the public when things like uber-rich oligarchs, the state and their bots run media and are in this kind of constant gaslighting making a population that doesn\u2019t even know whats real and what isn't.  Maybe it's time to go really grassroots and have anarchist street preachers.  It seemed like it worked in the past.  I've always wondered if maybe we should just completely abandon their media and start dropping off anarchist newspapers on our neighbors front door.  Maybe we should set up public speeches and engage in every audience-gathering tactic possible.  If the crowd gets big enough, the police come, and we repeat?  I know it seems idealistic, but I'm trying to look at things that have worked in the past.\n\nI don't know.  Our numbers don't need to be a majority for us to stop the world from catapulting further into the dystopia it's becoming but we definitely need more people, and we need to tie our ideas to the sort of fundemental ideals most people hold already.  I think salting at protests is one of our best tactics right now.",
