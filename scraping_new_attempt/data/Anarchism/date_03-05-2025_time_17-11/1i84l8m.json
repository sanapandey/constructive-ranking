    "selftext": "I'm looking to get more involved in the movement this year. Typical organizing (DA, marches) isn't really possible for me due to disabilities, and I already do a few things remotely. But I am skilled with web technologies, and good with electronic hardware (and trying to learn more), and I'm wondering if there are any project ideas for leveraging those skills.",
