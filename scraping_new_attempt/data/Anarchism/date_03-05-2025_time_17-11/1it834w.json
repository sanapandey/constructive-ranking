Jesus has some specific things to say about how we should treat the poor, foreign, and despondent, and about the wealthy. It became clear that conservatism didn't care about what Christ said. Then it became clear that most Christians didn't either. I'm not altogether no longer Christian, but I'd never claim to share a faith with those people any more.",

The story that people use as justification for taxes or obeying the government is the \"give unto Caesar what is Caesars\" line, with the context that Caesar's face was engraved on money.\n\nBut an alternative interpretation is this: The pharisees are trying to trap Jesus, either trick him into saying something illegal and subversive (like don't pay taxes and fuck the government) or something antithetical to his teachings (actually Caesar is above God!) but he slips through while also laying down some radical ideas. He says \"give unto God what is God's and give unto Caesar's\". Well the thing is, God is almighty right? Everything exists under him? Well if we give unto God what is God's, then there's nothing left to give to Caesar. Because Caesar is just another human being. I was at a county fair a couple years ago and there was a shirt for sale that said \"Kneel for the cross and stand for the flag\". Well if you're kneeling for the cross then you should never be standing for the flag. \n\nOne of the oldest strains of what could be considered political anarchism actually has its roots in Christianity, which is pretty cool imo.",

The satanic Temple in my mind straddles both individualism and collectivism, which anarchism does as well, in certain tendencies. There's also some mistakes that can be made, which is that while we view ourselves with self compassion, we don't place ourselves as objects to fawn over, to over idealize. We don't place ourselves as a higher power in the sense that we know are higher than everybody else, but that the artificially lowering of man to place God at the heights doesn't need to exist. We don't place ourselves any higher or lower than we were to begin with, but that the comparison between our human selves and an inhuman being is a fallacious one to begin with.\u00a0\nThat's why satanism is a nontheistic thing, and ties in with Bakunin notion that we need to abolish God.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's not even a requirement to believe in the supernatural for Satanism either, so it's not like I'm a ghost hunter either, some hippydippy guy who thinks ghosts are real.

Indulgence &pleasure are a part of it, but in a far more nuanced way then your putting it. Yes, there's even breaking taboos and enjoying pleasure for the sake of enjoying pleasure. But this isn't going full Diogenes & masturbating& defecating in public. It's accepting both rationality&emotionality are part of the experience of a fully formed human & part of experiencing emotion is that it's done for it's own sake. Yes, there's having boundaries on emotion's& indulgences, but not because these are external boundaries, but internal boundaries. Your a guide to your emotions and desires, not a drill sergeant, telling yourself how to feel and how not to feel( you feel what u feel regardless). Maybe either method is adaptive in certain environments, but the environment I want to be in is far more relaxed and allowing of nuance.\u00a0\n\nI guess a key distinction I make is that I don't think that our base lizard brain is either good or bad, I think it's useful in some circumstances and not in others. I don't need to pathologize either part, or raise one above the other. Also, just like how using your rational mind to the extreme is useful in some contexts and useless in others, so too goes for your desires. There are times where doing something extremely emotional is going to be good and healthy, and situations where that's going to be dangerous.\u00a0\n\n\nTLDR: it's a dialectic of integrating your rationality and emotion's, and part of that is letting both be useful in their contexts, and understanding that extremes can be healthy or unhealthy depending on the context.\u00a0",

That why political actions are taken out, not just in support of one self, but in support of others, and not only in an egotistical way, but clearly listens to the needs and wants and intelligence of others. U can't really do that if your too individualistic, and I know what that feels like with a dad who was narcissistic and egotistical. It's a proper community of individuals, who take turns. Turns doing individual stuff, pleasurable stuff sure. But to say that it's too individualistic, or too focused on pleasure versus rationality, or that it's only escapist, is only half the story, and oversimplifies it, losing context and certain details. It's like saying artists are Lost in emotion, and aren't really able to understand certain formal logic. Individually maybe, but there's artists who absolutely can do both.

It's dangerous to put too much value into them. That's why \"no gods, no masters\" is so important, divorcing ourselves from our deities is a cornerstone of building a harmonious world. Arguing over whose myth is actually real creates social division, oppression, and death that is not conducive to socialist thought.",

But what would you even do towards \"implementing\" a metaphysical belief on the world? Does that simply mean you act in accordance with the morals and ethics your metaphysics dictate? If so, there is no way to quantify a value judgement objectively for any ethical or moral system anyways, so the point is moot. Also, the idea that we are in a position to say that really any political system or moral and ethical framework is empirically verifiable is simply wrong. All material outcomes are a product of a myriad of contributing factors, and it is impossible to objectively say to what degree each contributed, or even to define all of the contributing factors. Maybe an omniscient being on an infinite time scale would be able to empirically determine which method of government leads to the statistically most ethical outcomes, but even that would be based on the ethics and morals of the being and thus the metaphysics of its existence. Obviously this doesn't make metaphysical arguments equivalent to empirically verifiable scientific observations, or even the theories that follow them, but that is because they are attempting  perceive and explain fundamentally different things. Jumbled jargon aside, what I am trying to say is that the questions of religion and the questions of science are fundamentally different, and aside from the early philosophical attempts to explain natural phenomena using religious ideation, they really have no place being in the same discussion outside of tangential overlap at the theoretical edge. I would, however, say that religious questions have direct bearing on the value systems we use to theorize about the best way to organize society, so it is important to not disregard religion as primal superstition when considering politics.",

It wasn't out of my love for corporate power, rather, I saw it as a more viable path to freedom and liberty than statism. Eventually I had to ask myself what would happen when big corporations and landlords took on the role of the state and how could we stop them, and free answer I could come up with ended up sounding more and more like a proletarian revolution. From there I started looking more into things like mutualism, socialism, social ecology, true anarchism, and general left libertarianism. \n\n\nSounds like you and I used to lean right for similar reasons, because we genuinely believed in freedom and we genuinely believed that that was the best path. For that reason, I do tend to give right-wing libertarians the benefit of the doubt of being well-minded people who are just incorrect.",

            "body": "I grew up in a very conservative and religious (Mormon) family. I drank the Kool-Aid. I remember when I was very little thinking Rush Limbaugh should be president.  The first time I was old enough to vote I voted against same-sex marriage in California's state-wide vote. But I remember standing at the ballot box thinking to myself \"God wants me to do this, but am I on the right side of history on this one?\" \n\nIn High School, I was in punk bands and had very inconsistent views about everything. I was anti-abortion and pro-immigration, I was anti-cop but pro-prisons, I was pro-legalization of marijuana but only because it could bring in tax revenue. I was all over the place. I also had two teachers who were very influential in my gradual shift. My American History teacher taught us ought of \"The People's History of the United States of America\" by Howard Zinn, and my philosophy teacher who never told us his feelings on anything, but forced us to question every belief we thought we held. I walked away from high school with a diploma and a lot of newly recognized cognitive dissonance. \n\nAfter high school I did the Mormon thing and became a missionary for two years. In those two years the discrepancies in my beliefs acted like a wedge that slowly pried apart my worldview. I began to reshape what I thought it meant to be a human in the world, I became less judgmental, less sure of my beliefs, less willing to tell someone they were wrong and I was right about anything. I was in a rough part of the US during a rough time in the country (2008-2010) and spent a lot of my time just chopping wood for people so they could keep warm in the winter. This work also shaped my thoughts on what I would later come to realize was mutual aid. \n\nSkip ahead a few years, I got married, had two kids, one of which is autistic and very inquisitive. He questioned everything I told him and I wasn't going to lie to my kid, so I told him the things I knew, told him the things I didn't know, and gave him as many alternative beliefs as I knew. Those interactions led me down long rabbit holes of digging into old philosophy books, reading about every religion I could find, deep diving into ethics and ecology and sociology and economics. As he grew up and his questions got deeper and more profound, it began to sink in that I know close to nothing. and if I know close to nothing, that means that everyone else probably knows close to nothing, including all of our so-called leaders. \n\nI picked back up that Howard Zinn book, I read manufacturing consent, and Foucault, Bookchin and Malatesta, Rocker and Kropotkin. I read Marx and Engels as well, and a bunch of other stuff. Some of it I agreed with, some of it not so much, but over and over again I found myself leaning further and further toward anarchism. At this point in my life I am not 100% convinced that anarchism is the only way forward, but I am convinced that it is the best method of moving forward for individuals everywhere. Being a good neighbor, caring about the people around you, helping where, when, and how you can, thinking beyond borders and cultural or racial differences, pursuing equity in all things... all of these things can't be bad.",

That's what steered me towards libertarianism at first. Though now, the American Libertarian movement is pretty much just MAGA/fascist with some strange stipulations, it once was very much about personal liberties and small government.\n\nI arrived at anarchy after reading lots of philosophy and and history. My interest in history began at a young age; I grew up Mormon and wanted to learn more about the history of my (former) faith with the intention of reinforcing it... turns out, a good understanding of history isn't compatible with staying Mormon \ud83d\ude05 so I left. It's odd, as I never wanted to loose my faith (as stated, quite the opposite), but it couldn't coexist any longer with what I had learned without enough cognitive dissonance to to drive one insane.\n\nSo there was a (very breif) time I was that most awkward of creatures... a conservative atheist (having left the faith before high-school) \ud83d\ude06\n\nI am fortunate, my parents supported and loved me through all of it, including leaving the church and even my conservative tendencies, though my parents were both mostly democratic party voters, with my dad being very much a Bernie Sanders esque liberal to moderately left. My parents never indoctrinated me into anything intentionally, always encouraging me to seek out knowledge, work on my personal development and think for myself.\n\nYou mentioned sociology and history being big influences, are there any books, essays, speeches or other works of literature that had a greater than average impact on you?",

Not LP libertarian but I was still fine with cops, democracy, etc. until I considered the contradictions between a federal government and liberty. Oddly enough I still hated politicians and federal police early on, which I believe carried my views along to anarchism.",

It's not morally wrong to be concerned about the greater good or think about community instead of single individuals. I became more and more disillusioned as I learned more, eroding the certainty of my beliefs as time went on; there wasn't a single \"come to Jesus\" moment, but COVID definitely solidified in my mind how fucked this current system is, and how interconnected we all are.",

Then they would go on to encourage the teens to hook up and get married as soon as they could and shame them into going to church and praying even harder if someone got pregnant. Then that child would be brought into and raised up in the church. Extra coin for the coffers is all it is.\n\nAnyone who isn't a Christian is viewed as the spawn of Satan, and even worse if they are an \"active sinner\" and stipl go to church. Lord forbid if you are gay and want to go to church. They may tolerate you, they may even smile at you, but as soon as you turn away or they think you are outside of hearing range, they say allllll kinds of nasty shit behind your back.\n\nOne of my favorite pastimes is calling out fake Christians and hanging them up with their own accusations. Whenever they twist scripture to be hateful, remind them about how Satan can use scripture against them. Then remind them that they are being hateful towards the poor and sick and minorities in general, and then remind them about how their lord and saviour wants them to treat the poor and sick and such while reminding them that if they want to actually be faithful they need to sell all of their belongings and give the money to the needy.\n\nThat they aren't worshipping Jesus and God, but Mammon, they worship acquiring money and clinging to it. They worship terrible people like Trump and Elon. They vote and support rapists and criminals in general just because they are Republican, and even go so far as to say God uses terrible people for heavenly purposes. Or that God uses the Devil to do his work.\n\n\nThey are really screwed up in the head. They have been conned.
