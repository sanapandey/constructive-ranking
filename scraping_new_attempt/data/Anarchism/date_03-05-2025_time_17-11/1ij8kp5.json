I'm not the person you were responding to but I'm a person in a similar situation with my child. I don't know that it's just anger that we feel. I truly believe it is a natural, maybe biological, response to threats against your child's life. I don't believe it can be described correctly. It's an emotion you must experience to understand.",

I meant that I dunno if the downvotes are disagreeing with that in principle or agreeing but finding them bringing this up as not getting the vibe of the conversation, as in it \"comes back to bite\" the fascists when they spread hate to radicate the power. It's in the comment I replied to them directly. As it may be better to discuss what's the deal if they think the person misunderstand, rather than jumping to think it's \"sealioning\", as that can be a form of interned mini mob rule. Which certainly as libertarian, ( not in that sense) we oppose that.",

Check and balances are actually a progression within the semi authoritarian majority rule, towards the ideal of power distribution, fascists use the rhetoric of the popular mandate, plebiscitarianism, to draw more power for themselves. Hopefully we are past this, but overall aspiring dictators play with fire and are the first to asvocate harsh punishments and death penalty galore, be it even indirectly through police altercation, snobbing or removing the concept of proportional use of force.",
