    "selftext": "I was wondering what ways could really get back at the top 1%, whithout causing much harm to those involved. I think its easy to call for mass General strikes, but that takes a lot of planning and people would experience real harm by being out of work for what would likely need to be a multiple week strike. \n\n  \nMy proposal is this. Any left leaning person who has a mortgage should simply stop paying it. \n\n  \nThat's the elevator pitch, but more realistically the sudden loss of thousands of mortgage payments would cripple these banks. And its something that can be sustained for multiple months by the witholder. Month 1, you save $X amount of dollars. By month 2, they'll start making calls etc... Now you have $2x cash in your savings. MAYBE by month 3 they'll start making motions like they'll go to court. Maybe send a demand letter, it will be different in each state. But All in all, across each of the states, you'll likely have 3-6 months of being able to save up your mortgage payment, before they even get the courts involved. \n\n  \nNow here we are at month 6, this has become a movement (1000 people per state could be enough, but obviously more is better), banks are really feeling the pain of not having the cash, and now you all are sitting on 6 months of mortgage that you can keep as cash, (or likely will use it to help with any varrying emergencies that will spring up in the next few months of the Regime). They start moving to foreclose on these homes. Depending on your state, you could be looking at an additional 6 months to upto and beyone 24 months. Especially since we'll now be clogging the already strained court system with all of these foreclosure cases. (Most firms handling foreclosure have lowered staffing levels since the 2008-2012 US mortgage crisis, it would likely take them 1-2 years to fire back up to 2010 levels to now match the demand to even file the cases). \n\nSo, they blink. Then hey, no harm no foul, you've got the 6 months in the bank you can just bring everything current and we've had our demands met. If they don't, then as you can see, likely anyone who is fortunate to be in this situation would likely have 1-2 years to be able to weather this storm so it would likely be the Banks that crumble first. Only took about 2 weeks of witheld labor during the pandemic to realize that could make them cow. \n\n  \nWilling to workshop, but I think this could be an avenue to put pressure on the top from the middle.

Probably the only form of capital they'll ever have access to *and* (more importantly) a basic human need. You're assuming banks and the state will play fair\n\nYou can theorycraft the effectiveness all you want but people are going to be understandably hesitant start doing this with no assurances about the effectvness. Also 1000 people per state means you need several times that number to do eviction defense. And because this is gonna be incredibly geographically dispersed you'll need to ensure those people are willing and able to travel swiftly and on short notice.",

I appriciate the opportunity to further refine my argument. \n\n  \nI would argue couldn't we solve for that with some type of, may sound childish, but like a sign up sheet, where in we all say ok, starting March 1st we all start. And people can be girded by seeing others signing up (annonomously somehow). And then their friends tell their friends, and then their friends tell their friends... \n\n  \nAs to the risk for people's housing, I fully understand. I wouldn't want anyone going into this type of agreement that was already on shaky ground. I'm not sure how to counter that argument other than I fully believe that due to the bureaucracy\u00a0still existing both within the banks infrastructures, and put into place at the municipal level, that anyone that agrees to this would likely have at least 6 months before anyone would even come close to being able to legally remove you from the premesis. And my thesis is, if enough people join up, it would never have to get to the 6th month, they'd cave at the lack of capital around month 3. Not to mention, the more people who are in for the long haul, the more the court system is log jammed, further delaying the process. In the previous mortgage crisis, they were litigating in 2011 people who hadn't paid a mortgage since 2008. There are also all sorts of Pro Se responses a homeowner could file to clog up the works even further delaying. I think I guess my point is those that can, gum up the works as long as possible, for the gears to break and they relent.",
