There seems to be some 11th hour confusions since many are asking the same few questions about the time to meet, and now on doubts about its legitimacy or concerns over counter-protesters.\n\n\nI am staying tuned to see how it goes - but I think it's an earnest attempt to get something started on a national scale, despite many glaring holes in its planning",

If you have any protest experience, medical training, or just want to join the crowd, most locations could use support and attendance.\n\nETA:  Seriously, many of these organizers are babes in the woods\u2026.  They need help as most do not understand basic security measures and wholeheartedly believe the Police will help keep their actions safe\u2026.  \n\nWho knows how many members of the public will show to these events.  Or how many of the opposition, because these actions are largely being planned in the open online and Fash are aware\u2026 If you can show up on the ground and help, please do\u2026. These individuals may be comfortable enough to not appreciate how oppressive the State is, but that does not mean we should leave them twisting in the wind\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take many strange bedfellows to oust the fascists\u2026.",

But it is quite clear, most of the subreddit hasn\u2019t been to a protest, let alone organized one.\n\nI had to explain to the DC contingent, multiple times and people kept pushing back, that getting a permit to protest at Congress or anywhere on the National Mall is a major assumption of risk for whoever gets named as the permit holder.\n\nThis is a DC quirk, because everything downtown is Federal, but the person or organization named as the permit holder assumes financial liability for any damages or defacement that may occur.  This event has no backing organization, meaning some poor soul would have to put everything on the line.\n\nThe sheer number of times I\u2019ve had to explain to people it is entirely unreasonable to expect any individual to assume legal liability for an event open to the public and on the Fash radar.  If anything happened, the individual named on the permit could face financial ruin.\n\nPeople were saying, but we need to do everything the \u201cproper\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d way.  My dudes, spontaneous protests are not uncommon in DC, just show up.\n\nAlso, if you get a permit to protest at Congress, Cap Police make sure to tuck you away on part of the grounds where you can\u2019t even see the building.\n\nOrganizing is just herding cats\u2026.
