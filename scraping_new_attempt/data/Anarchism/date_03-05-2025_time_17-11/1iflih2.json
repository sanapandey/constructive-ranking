Because they forgot how useful it is to make the autocratic oligarchy bourgeoisie realize they\u2019re not in power. Only reason they are in charge of shit is misinformation and fear. Once people realize they\u2019re being mislead and there is no reason to be scared of our current ruling class. Then this shit show of a ruling government will be gone.",
