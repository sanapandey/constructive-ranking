She had some interesting ideas that are relevant to current intersectionalism/identity related discussions which might be seen by some as contentious. It would probably be fair to call her a \"class reductionist\", for instance at some point she stated that \"black people wouldn't be hated if they weren't poor\". I tend to think she had a point there. For one thing, the alternative would be to assume that racism is somehow inherently given to people, which seems absurd given the higly historically specific nature of racism. Case in point: racism towards Irish migrants clearly being about them being considered paupers. I think we do well to remember that all kinds of structural discrimination can in the end be understood as ways to put whole demographics of people on a lower shelf, rather than the other way round. That doesn't mean we have to ignore the specific forms of discrimination, on the contrary it helps us understand just how these discriminations function in attempts to break up solidarity. This was something Lucy Parsons understood very well. \n\nToo bad she fell into bolshevist ideological aberrations later in life.",

While some radicals at the time, bought into Marx's classist and reductionist theory of the lumpenproletariat -- Parsons, herself an ex-slave, a black/indigenous woman, a widow, formerly homeless, informally educated, and a housewife, set out to defend and unite not only workers, but those in society usually trivialized and written off by so-called revolutionaries and capitalists alike. \n\nIn what would become her most notorious action of many; on Thanksgiving day in 1884, as Chicago's wealthy sat down for lavish feasts, she organized and lead thousands of Chicago's homeless residents, housewives, children, recently released inmates, and unemployed workers down Prairie Avenue --Chicago's wealthiest neighborhood at that time-- to demand/take food and destroy the opulent tranquility that the capitalists and city leaders had created for themselves from the sweat and misery of the toiling and suffering masses. \n\nIn her own words: \"Passivity while slavery is stealing over us is a crime. For the moment we must forget that we are anarchists\u2014when the work is accomplished we may forget that we were revolutionists\u2014hence most anarchists believe the coming change can only come through a revolution, because the possessing class will not allow a peaceful change to take place; still, we are willing to work for peace at any price, except at the price of liberty.\"",

For her part, she claimed he tried to stab her with a knife when she rejected his desire to join the military, which is when she had him checked into a mental institution. \n\nIt\u2019s also perhaps a testament to how militant her politics were, for better or for worse.
