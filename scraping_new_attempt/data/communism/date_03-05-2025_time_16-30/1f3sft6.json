    "selftext": "Is there any comrade who can give me a clear outline of how CPUSA was structured? I got comfused when reading historial essays that keep appearing terms like 'National Board', 'National Committee' or 'National Executive Committee' and I couldn't make sense what their relationships are like. I've read about the similar chart of structures of other communist parties including CPC or CPSU, and I wonder is there a similar chart for CPUSA. ",
