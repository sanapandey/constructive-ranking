This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

Amin actually represented the revolutionary line, while every other socialist country was revisionist. They could have easily spread the revolution elsewhere had they actually were allowed the conquered the reactionaries. The Khalq actually represented the bolshevik way by capturing the state, abolishing it, repressing reactionaries, and then defeating reactionaries miltiarily, all while pursuing land reforms. Imagine a world where they did defeat the reactionaries. Couldnt it have been possible to spread it to other countries like the Bolsheviks did?",

The author argues that the portion of Khalq around Amin was the only faction which came close to mobilizing the country's masses toward revolution. The book does not examine anything after the invasion and Amin's death, but for most communists that is the part that is most interesting.\n\nI would also be wary of a lot of media, especially videos and podcasts about Afghanistan which is made by people like Vijay Prashad and those \"content creators\" of his ilk. They will usually defend the Parcham-era PDPA against anticommunist fabrications without putting forward any important points beyond the idea that the Afghan government in the 1980's was good. It is a good exercise to compare how the subject is handled in a video or podcast from someone like Prashad to Beverly Male's work to really see how poor left-wing infotainment can be.",

                    "body": "Marcyism is so funny. Becker accidentally implies that their own politics are to the right of MLK Jr. and the masses of the civil rights movement (the argument is the Parcham faction, supported by the USSR, was equivalent to those who thought MLK Jr. was moving too fast because of the entrenched opposition of white supremacy - that of course is the faction they support since they just said Soviet intervention was correct against Amin's threats to the revolution and authoritarian tendencies). Which is of course correct. They also make the argument that the USSR was correct to support the Parcham faction and its moderation of the revolution, only to then immediately say that this same moderation led to Gorbachev's reforms in the USSR and similar results in Afghanistan (which he explicitly says caused the PDPA's collapse as it did in the USSR). It must be sad to be stuck in 1980, wishing for Brezhnev of all people to live forever. \n\nThey also accuse Amin of being a CIA puppet (which was the Soviet justification for assassinating him) because he made contact with the Americans to insist Afghanistan was \"non-aligned\" even though they previously said non-alignment was good (because it shows Afghanistan was not a Soviet puppet) and was \"progressive\" according to Samir Amin's analysis. They may be living in 1980 in the USSR but they are stuck in 1960 in the middle east, relying on \"Arab nationalism\" to do the work of progress for them. The increasingly reactionary nature of that same bourgeois nationalism in Lebanon/Syria, Iraq, Egypt, North Yemen, Iran, and more general reactionary turn of the bourgeoisie in every postcolonial state *including* Afghanistan simply doesn't make sense in this framework (the Saur revolution is inexplicable to Becker and his guest since Khan was aligned with the Soviets and implementing \"progressive\" reforms before his overthrow).\n\nThe rest is garbage. There's no analysis of the internal class structure of Afghanistan and the region, no real analysis of the political differences in the PDPA (except that this was a \"healthy debate\" or whatever like they were sitting around a campfire), and frankly nothing interesting from an aesthetic standpoint. Becker has an annoying drawl and the \"analysis\" of the PDPA only comes 40 minutes in because they can't focus (they keep getting distracted with gotchas about the US, like anyone listening doesn't already believe the US was in the wrong). The guest admits multiple times he knows nothing about the PDPA and the period (blaming \"us\" for not knowing) so why is he a guest? To agree with Becker who knows the exact same information about US support of Osama Bin Laden? That piece of information may have still been shocking in 2001 when ANSWER was formed but now I can just go to the grifters at *Blowback* for the same information, no party dues necessary.",
