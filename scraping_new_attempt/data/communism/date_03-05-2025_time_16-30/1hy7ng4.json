You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Dongping Han's *The Unknown Cultural Revolution* and Mobo Gao's *The Battle for China's Past* are also both good (though not actually Marxist) re-examinations of the events of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also am rather partial to the film *Breaking with the Old Ideas,* which is one of the last great socialist movies ever made, and it really captures the essence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.  For a long time, I had trouble really breaching what the Cultural Revolution was about and what was going on, and I had read a lot of articles and books filled with facts and dates and events but I was still confused, still struggling to understand what was really happening -- but by about 15 minutes into this film everything about the Cultural Revolution suddenly clicked and made perfect and total sense (including the articles I had read, and it revealed which were revolutionary, and which were reactionary and wrong) and once you comprehend that essence, everything else falls into place.\n\nedit:  Also, the documentary series *How Yukong Moved the Mountains* is an excellent look into GPCR era China.",

            "body": "Alessandro Russo's \"Cultural Revolution and Revolutionary Culture\" highlights many of the internal contradictions within the party at the time and upholds the GPCR as a political experiment. There is a rather large focus on the implications of the play \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,\" which was one of many catalysts revealing the ideological and political disputes that had gone unresolved, and why they were of the utmost importance to struggle for.\n\nI would also recommend \"The Morning Deluge\" and \"Wind in the Tower\" by Han Suyin. The series is as a historical outline which upholds Mao and covers his early life until his death. If you are familiar with Mao's works in general, Suyin also does a great job in referencing them throughout, giving context to their situation historically.\u00a0",
