Something I want to discuss when I can bring it up is analysis of Tricycle drivers (I think the closest idea in other countries would be a pedicab). \n\nMy gut instinct feels that there is something different between a vehicle used for mass transport, and another vehicle used as a form of taxi. However tricycle drivers are also poor, and depending on the setup of their franchise may also not own their tricycle.\n\nThere is some interesting history though, the Amerikkkans tried to popularize the human powered rickshaw which was met with resistance, at least according to this article though I'll have to study it more.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/rickshaws-and-filipinos-transnational-meanings-of-technology-and-labor-in-americanoccupied-manila/38B0B7062070A05936C131D4BA9C0F6E\n\nThough I'm unsure if there has been any more analysis on the general topic of transportation.\n\nI would like to know if there has been any deeper analysis on transportation from other communists?",

They are also poor, I would think most also fit that category of semi-proletariat, but the nature of their work is different from mass transportation. I guess to put it more bluntly, I observe more organization for the cause of Jeepney drivers but see much less with tricycle drivers. \n\nAnother thing is the conversion of the semiproletariat into proletariat, which can be seen with the Jeepney modernization program. \n\nI would like to have more discussion about it because it seems like an issue that is closer to something tangible in the lives of Filipinos. For instance the U$-Marcos alliance is somewhat abstract (unless you live near a U$ Base) and though it is something we should profoundly reject it isn't something one usually observes unless they encounter the soldiers themselves. With jeepney drivers, in a regular commute you can see what they are going through, and if you talk with them learn about the precarious nature of their lives. One can also see the cynical belief that E-Jeepneys are some solution (when it is essentially a mini-van) and how it does not solve any of the issues it claims to solve. \n\nYou seem familiar with the Philippine context, maybe you can offer your thoughts, I'd be happy to learn.",

A few months ago I made a comment about how it would be impossible for an artist as popular and as mainstream as Bob Dylan was in 1971 to release a song like \"George Jackson\". I still think that is true: perhaps the equivalent in terms of popularity would be someone like Kendrick Lamar releasing a song about Palestinian prisoners or something like that. Yet he has remained silent, which was to be expected\\*. Of course, we expect more from Hip-Hop artists in comparison to other artists in terms of activism due to the history of the genre, but I would say that, ever since at least the turn of the century, political Hip-Hop as a subgenre has becamed completely marginal and those who declare themselves to be political have few interesting things to say (or sell out like Big Mike or Ice Cube).\n\nAbout billy woods, i don't want to sound mean but the guy makes music for Anthonys Fantanos: guys who want to seem cool by listening to Hip-Hop, on one hand; while on the other only giving praise to \"artsy\" and \"intellectualoid\" hip-hop artists. It is very telling how Fantano constantly fails to predict the direction to which music is going: he either praises artists which are nothing new in terms of style and have made no (or few) contributions to the evolution of the genre's \"sound\", so to say (Kendrick's albuns, the last Tribe album, for example); or he praises albuns which are so \"advanced\" in terms of sound that, in the end, they truly aren't really advanced because they are too detached from what Hip-Hop (in general) at the moment sounds like - theses artists or albuns ended up not having that much impact in the evolution of Hip-Hop (Im thinking of names like Death Grips or JPEG Mafia; guys whose influence in mainstream is virtually unnoticeable). It his also very telling that he gave such low scores to albuns like 808s & Heartbreak, Yeezus or that he dislikes Lil Wayne in general, when Kanye and Lil Wayne (Kanye more in terms of sound, Lil Wayne more in terms of rapping techinque) are the blueprint, for better or worse, for current Hip-Hop.\n\n\\*The problem for political Hip-Hop artists, and in this I will include Kendrick, is that a lot of the times they only worry about being revolutionary in terms of the content of their art, not worrying about being original too in terms of form. I know that I will sound like Im trying to be different but Kendrick always bored me. There is nothing (or very few things) original in him. He is basically a mixture of Tupac (mostly the \"political\" content of his songs) with Lil Wayne (his rapping technique). His instrumentals are also not revolutionary (in the artistic sense). All this in my opinion, of course. Subjectively, I also dislike his voice.\n\nAlso something that should not be ignored is how well he has been assimilated by liberalism; this becamed even more visible after his beef with Drake and his Superbowl performance. Basically everyone has sided with Kendirck. I have even seen corporations make Tiktoks or whatever siding with Kendrick and making fun of Drake. Not something you would expect regarding a \"revolutionary\" rapper.",

That's not why a song like Sing About Me I'm Dying of Thirst can hit the way it does. White people have observed a black person rapping about his life and decided he's talking about the *The Revolutionary Black Experience*.\n\n\nI don't mean to go ballistic on you.

I think that's encapsulated by you talking about SAMIDOT.\n\nFor starters, I'm Indian. Kendrick's music was part of the process of me becoming more 'leftist' and listening to his music made me learn more about New Afrika. And yes, feel free to critique that, since metropolitan petite-bourgeois youth in India seem to think listening to rap songs means you can pose as being black (or even say slurs).\n\nI still listen to GKMC or TPAB because of moments like SAMIDOT (I mean when he says \"if I die before your album drop..\" still makes me emotional) or How Much A Dollar Cost. That's why the thought that Kendrick is unoriginal didn't make sense to me.\n\nKendrick's music has also seemingly touched upon the third world as well, at the very least I know a Dalit Tamil progressive rapper called Arivu (I have my problems with him, especially since he got more famous recently and started associating himself with questionable politics, but that hasn't affected his music much yet thankfully) who was massively inspired by Kendrick's music. And I do love the way Arivu writes and what he has to say. And the kind of qualities (a focus on writing, and that too vividly about one's/ a people's experience) of Kendrick's music and the beauty of hip-hop in general is what makes it seem to resonate with people in the third world (both rapping and the dance form). Like I said, not that his politics was ever revolutionary or anything but it did influence me positively and was part of my 'radicalisation process', along with the reformism and all.\n\nBut I do stand by my dislike for Kendrick since 2022. The idea that his 'healing' since MMATBS constitutes him just not being as political anymore just irks me. And the fact that people justify it makes me dislike it even more. I miss a song like Blacker the Berry for instance, because often I relate to the anger. Especially in the last couple years with my involvement in Palestine solidarity organising and experiencing more racism being Indian, and understanding the Indian struggle as a whole.\n\nTbh these are quite unfiltered thoughts.

I remember some of my white friends wondering why I was a bit disgruntled by it when the album came out. Between Auntie Diaries, the whole \"I'm not your savior\" thing, and Kodak it really felt like this was Kendrick patting himself on the back before fully completing his transformation into one of the black bourgeoisie, and it absolutely was. That being said, since then I went through some shit, and had to unpack some shit from my past and the next time I listened to that album I fought back tears. \n\n\nThere's some shit on there that is very personal and uncomfortably real for certain experiences. For me it represents that despite everything we go through, there is still hope for black people that we can heal.\nAs a child I endured repeated abuse from white adults that was concealed from my parents. It made me a bitter, alienated and violent person, and hearing myself reflected back on this album helped me more than any therapist or counselor ever could. \n Shit I'm getting a bit teary-eyed just thinking about it. \n\n\nIt was ultimately Fanon, Malcolm X, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Sakai and Mao that gave me the keys to understanding and healing, but I will always credit art that showed me that I wasn't alone. \n\n\nThe difference between the conclusion reached by me and the conclusion reached by this album is that the knowledge that I can heal makes me want to fight harder.",

I am a southern european, but still white.\n\nIn all honesty, there is not much that I can reply to you without sounding like I'm trying to force my point of view or repeating what I have already said in comments where others have criticized me. The fact that a handful of users, including some that are well regarded here, have criticized me makes me assume that I am probably in the wrong here.\n\nI would, however, point out that when I mentioned that some see Kendrick as revolutionary, I wasn't specifically talking about black people in particular. I had in mind either those that I know in real life (which are mainly white and from a country completely different from the US) or what I see on the internet. As you can imagine, I don't know any New African personally.\n\nI am also aware that Kanye, a lot of times, operated by taking elements from the underground or lesser known waves or artists (parasitically like you said it) and incorporating them in more mainstream music. In my opinion, there is still merit in that too, but I understand your point. About Bob Dylan I only know a few songs, and I was only talking about one in specific (George Jackson), but don't you agree that it would be very improbable for a song like that one to be made today by an artist as mainstream as he was? I am not so much focusing on him as an artist (nor saying that he was a revolutionary while nowadays artists are not), but more on the structure of the music industry (or society in general) which allowed for certain themes to be addressed back then that wouldn't be possible now. About Jay Electronica, I do think that, thinking better, you are indeed right.\n\nAnd, since we are here, I am also interested in hearing which rappers do you think are good (like I asked another user).",

I lurk here and only just started commenting and the way you all handle criticism is something I greatly respect and try to emulate. \n\n\nI think the main reason why Bob Dylan could make a song like that is because no one really cares about George Jackson. I personally care about his life and his work quite a bit but I think if you were to ask the average white person who was around then who George Jackson was they wouldn't know or feel strongly about him. It was a nice PR stunt for Bob and his hero status among settlers is still virtually unblemished. He scored points with the Berkeley camp and the Bacon camp didn't care. \n\n\nPalestine is far more visible among the US population right now. I think that artists of Dylan's size back then would have been skittish about something like this too. \nThat being said it's embarrassing to hip hop that of all the \"big\" rappers only Macklemore had the stones to make a pro Palestine rap calling on people to withhold their votes. \n\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that music culture is more fragmented than it's ever been. The middle section of artists is larger (but less wealthy) than in the past and many of them can and have made at least marginally pro palestine music, but the ones at the very top like Drake, Kendrick and them are very much still dependent on record labels, distributors, promotion deals and good PR with the public.\n I've seen rappers call for the death of Joe Biden for his genocide, just not popular ones. An example would be Infinity Knives. \n\n\nLastly, I think petty bourgeois anxiety about A.I. and the class position of musicians also makes them less likely to step out of line. I credit reading y'all on this sub for making me have to start being honest with myself about how my being a musician was making me take reactionary stances on A.I among several other things. \n\n\nAlso to be fair to you I have more of an axe to grind with Bob Dylan than most because I'm from the same state as him and euro americans worship him here. He frequently gets used as an example of what \"real lyricism\" looks like as opposed to rap so when I see someone bring up Bob Dylan and Hip Hop in the same sentence I immediately expect racism. \n\n\n\n>And, since we are here, I am also interested in hearing which rappers do you think are good (like I asked another user).\n\n\nHonestly at the moment when it comes to mainstream hip hop right now I'm most interested in what the ladies are doing. Meg, Flo Milli, Rico Nasty, Doechii etc. To me Glorilla is by far the most interesting new rapper to emerge out of the 2020's. I'm honestly just happy to see black women that don't have to force themselves to be considered \"classy\" by Euroamerican standards finally get to talk their shit in on stage, even if it isn't revolutionary. \n\n\nI think I most often listen to chopped soul/jazz sampled stuff ala Denzel Curry, Lupe, Black Thought, Larry June, Schoolboy Q, Action Bronson, Freddie Gibbs and all them.\n\n\n[edit] grammar and clarified a few sentences.",

But it\u2019s very sobering to read through these threads and see the artists being praised actually gravitate toward the median of \u201cacceptable\u201d reddit musicians like Bob Dylan or most surprisingly the hip hop heads type recommendations from u/red_star_erika. To be fair to her she wasn\u2019t speaking authoritatively or even as a rap fan. The Jay Electronica mention was arguably even worse.\n\nThe artists you raise toward the end of your post are more interesting and worth including in the conversation because what\u2019s ultimately happening here is pretending to grapple with the ideology of compradors who claim to speak for New Afrikans and dismissing it, while intentionally excluding music that is still immanent in some sense to class struggle. I seriously doubt anyone in this thread before you had the idea to ask both what appeals people to Kendrick (something I\u2019d like to hear more from you about) but also the legitimate artistic production occurring organically. But I don\u2019t think anyone here is equipped to or has any stakes in analyzing NBA Youngboy or Glorilla. The outcome either way is these people being excluded from the conversation and talked for just so they can be turned into strawmen. It\u2019s pretty grim.",

I should have been clearer though that I wasn\u2019t trying to single you out as a particularly bad contributor to the thread.\n\n> would it not be worth understanding why he ended up more interesting artistically?\n\nWell this is what I\u2019m really challenging. Actually I don\u2019t really agree that every person mentioned by u/humblegold is all that good. I should have been at least somewhat critical, since it\u2019s not even really true that all of their art would be immanent to class struggle. Rather I was really responding to the centering of Glorilla who I do find interesting. \n\nArtists aren\u2019t what I called immanent to class struggle but the art itself. That\u2019s something we determine after the fact based on the content of the work arranged in a social totality.\n\nSo where I see eye-to-eye with u/humblegold is that there\u2019s a worthwhile analysis to be made of the recent wave of popular female rappers. I want to point to Nicki Minaj\u2019s song Shether to begin.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/61TJVzkdKNA\n\nThe content is clearly reactionary: Remy Ma is a \u201cgroupie\u201d whose connections in hip hop come from however many guys who have claimed to have slept with her. Putting aside the gossip that comes from a diss track, this is the key takeaway. Nicki Minaj very specifically has been a vessel for male chauvinism in rap her entire career. The contradiction of being a \u201cvalid\u201d female emcee in a genre dominated by men is resolved with her own history of sexism, which is really just capitalist ideology speaking through her. In fact the necessity of a female rapper being so vile is a fairly recent phenomenon.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f8cHxydDb7o\n\nThe objective outcome of the neo-colonization of New Afrika is the introduction of all forms of reaction. So I\u2019m not pinning this all on Nicki Minaj but instead I see it as the words of the new comprador class, reflecting patriarchal capitalist ideology.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to see more conversation about that u/humblegold brought to the table is what lead to the final death of a relative dry spell for female rap and the explosion of a very particular \u201cgenre\u201d which is sexually outspoken women whose music intentionally avoids the male gaze, like Glorilla. Determining if this is truly immanent to the class struggle or not is beyond my own abilities but it\u2019s at least a better use of everyone\u2019s time than most of what had been said in this thread before.\n\n> isn\u2019t this inherent to discussing art?\n\nWell amongst discrete people on an online forum it\u2019s simply the popular tendency, dictated by the logic of reddit itself. But it\u2019s also something that should be resisted. What I didn\u2019t mean by exclusion was the obvious inability for certain people to speak, what I\u2019d actually meant was the understanding that certain people can\u2019t speak and accepting that on its face and deciding to speak for them, ultimately leading to laziness and crappy conversations.",

I would add that I find the cultural conversation around her unashamedly heavy Memphis accent to be important as well. Specifically how her accent relates to how the femininity of black women is perceived, how language and accents get used to enforce cultural norms etc. Her and Meg Thee Stallion's song 'Accent' is probably the most literal reflection of this. \n\n\nFrom a craft standpoint it's interesting how the Memphis accent being what it is opens up rhymes that literally aren't possible in standard dialects of English, and specifically how the interplay of her demonstrated ability to speak \"proper English\"  with her conscious choice not to change or dampen her accent despite the doors it would open. The heavily circulated interview clip of her rhyming 'beautiful' with 'spirit' comes to mind, or her songs where she rhymes a \"Standard\" word with a \"Memphis\" word. \n\n\nI should clarify in regards to your statement about criticism that several of the male rappers I mentioned I don't consider particularly useful to class struggle. There's little political value in Action Bronson's music to me, it actually makes sense that his music is as reactionary as it is because one of his parents fled the Hoxha administration. \n\n\nI put those men in the same jazz/soul category because I see aspects of the jazz tradition reflected in them, be it production choices, philosophical approach to their craft, rhythmic styles etc. I occasionally transcribe their rhythmic phrases the way I might a Paul Chambers solo to use later for improvisation. Also they occasionally reflect certain parts of my own life in the same way grunge spoke to disgruntled petty bourgeois youth of the 90's, sadly even in their chauvinism. \n\n\n>What I didn\u2019t mean by exclusion was the obvious inability for certain people to speak, what I\u2019d actually meant was the understanding that certain people can\u2019t speak and accepting that on its face and deciding to speak for them, ultimately leading to laziness and crappy conversations\n\nThis is right on the money.",

If I\u2019m building off of his arguments, an interesting angle to me is that Meg and Glorilla are conjunctive interventions where the voice of the subaltern speaks beyond words (if we momentarily treat them monadically) but within pure articulation.\n\nTo be fair to Nicki she was outspokenly a NYer in her language, but what cuts her off and brings her into the postmodern is a populist extroversion. Think of the reverse of *Honestly, Nevermind* where instead of commodifying the domesticity of NJ, the world of Nicki Minaj imagines a distinctly male world of common rap. Regional and class differences are flattened out into a flow of pure content or reterritorialized lignes de fuit. The logical conclusion of this is Travis Scott but Kanye West is a sort of parasitic zygote. This specific movement is distinctly postmodern in its obliteration of the real in favor of the primacy of the commodity fetish. For Nicki, her voice is just part of the product. For Glorilla, you should be alienated by it.\n\nJust trying to expand on you gravitating toward the accent as Glorilla\u2019s interesting.",

I\u2019d meant \u201cthese people\u201d as in New Afrikans and people with their class perspective. That\u2019s who\u2019s excluded.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that anyone was speaking for artists about their own art, or that I\u2019m speaking for Nicki Minaj, but that ex post facto the conversation was immanent to a non-proletarian position which created a specific disconnect: the thread gave a one-sided analysis of the content of comprador ideology but was unable to progress into the appeal of the music to the subaltern classes of the u.s. This is actually the meat of what u/humblegold had to say and his most interesting observation. His response to you contained a potent quote from Sakai I also agree with. Basically, what was being said was obvious and far from a Marxist analysis. It was liberal common sense dolled up with Marxist terminology.\n\n> art should speak for itself\n\nSince art doesn\u2019t have a mouth, it\u2019s merely an image or a dead monad given life by scientific critique. We give it the mouth and by the grace of god what it speaks must be truth. So the argument is just that you were incorrect, at the most bestowing the art with a mouth that speaks a half-truth, stating the obvious, obfuscating what\u2019s critical: productive analysis that lends insight into the consciousness of the proletariat and \u201cchanges the world\u201d.\n\nSorry if what I said in the first comment was unclear, by the way.\n\nedit: Music is a relatively autonomous cultural sphere. The danger is falling into a mechanistic determination of the bourgeois content of the music and chalking up the enjoyment of it by New Afrikans as nothing more than an outcome of a \u201cdegenerated\u201d class perspective, or an over exaggerated theoretical dependence on the presence of the lumpenproletariat. In both cases it\u2019s close to what u/humblegold warned against which is seeing New Afrikans as brainwashed. The sphere of musical production itself is a decentered structure and its consumption in the postmodern area is more like a buffet table where the unconscious selects particular elements and wilfully ignores the rest. That\u2019s. because everything is a commodity, even what we retroactively determine as revolutionary, a type of \u201ccontent\u201d that is also a decentered structure.",

We do have some overlap but that's really not what I'm getting at. It's the perspective, and the taste of users in this thread helps elucidate that. \n\n\n\n\n>what makes this so and what makes these artists more immanent to class struggle? so far, u/humblegold has only qualified them by genre influence and gender\n\n\n\n\nFor starters, this obviously isn't \"immanent\" to class struggle. That's just a lazy way to dodge responsibility by pointing out the completely true fact that this is relatively low priority for communists. You all as communists consciously chose to discuss African music, so now an African musician is challenging you to do so in a way that isn't garbage. \n\n\n\n \nJ. Sakai points out that any garden variety liberal can identify that there is in fact an upper class that is materially incentivised in reproducing its own ideology. That any settler would-be class traitor has a responsibility to go beyond pedestrian race unity regarding New African conditions. All people in this thread have done is congratulate each other for the groundbreaking realization that yes, petty and haute bourgeois musicians reproduce their class ideology through music. I can walk into a barbershop and have a conversation more valuable than that. \n\n\nAfter Doonkerr's first comment correctly pointing out Billy Woods' reactionary and disgusting anti maoist comments any other comments became redundant, unless they were to actually advance the analysis, which none did. The actual  purpose they served was reinforcing the idea that African music exists only for the consumption of settlers, and that any connection actual Africans might have to it is an exception not worth analyzing. \n\n\nThere's been no attempt to see what aspects of these hip hop artists resonate with the New African population. Until\nyou've done that everything in this thread is little better than YouTube video essay slop and will inevitably arrive at the liberal conclusion that the black proletariat and lumpenproletariat is simply \"brainwashed\" into enjoying bourgeois music. \n\n\nI don't yet have the ability to fully analyze this music with a proletarian perspective as a New African petty bourgeoisie. If I can't do it, you all as the settler petty bourgeoisie definitely can't and you haven't proven otherwise. I have a feeling that someone like Smokeuptheweed or DashTheRed could, but until they do I haven't seen anything. \n\n\nI'm not advocating this sub become a Glorilla fanpage, I'm demanding you either advance your Marxist lens or dispense with the liberal garbage before it turns into racism. I can't tell you how that will look because I don't know how white communists should go about accomplishing that. \n\n\n\n>isn't this inherent to discussing art? you say you are a dedicated fan of hip-hop but this comment reads as shutting down on the possibility of it being engaged with by us which seems more grim to me.\n\n\nWhat's wrong with you guys being shut out? I should be shut out of a discussion Smoke has about Korean history because I can't contribute to it more than the average liberal.  \n\n\nSo far you've all provided as much value as the settler lens can and thus should be shut out if your lens can't be developed. I revisited this thread several times before commenting waiting for something more valuable and it hadn't revealed itself, so now I'm providing the petty black perspective. \n\nOnce we have access to the black lumpen and proletarian perspective, if I can't advance my own I should be shut out as well.",

I never said the music was only for the consumption of settlers and I in fact implied the opposite by mentioning overlap in demographics. my purpose in saying that mainstream music has to be able to appeal to settlers was to open up the possibility of a revolutionary struggle in art taking place in the underground in response to the other user's overreliance on influence as a metric. \n\nsince we are capable of grasping proletarian politics despite being non-proletarian, the same should apply to our approach to art although you and I have both said we need improvement in this area. I think feeling resonance with art is a political matter and since you said in another comment that you resonated with a Kendrick album because of oppression you went through, that would indicate a progressive aspect to the music although you note its shortcomings in not resolving in a revolutionary manner. I do not say things like \"here is why this or that appeals to New Afrikans\" (aside from the fact that there could be both reactionary or revolutionary reasons for why something appeals to someone including those who are oppressed) because art or aspects of art which I say are good and art or aspects of art that are capable of resonating with the advanced feelings of the oppressed should be one and the same thing since I am trying to apply Marxism. of course, I am not confident in my ability to do this so if I say something is good and it is bad or vice versa, I should be criticized. but ultimately, I am just as capable of understanding things as someone like smokeuptheweed. \n\n>I should be shut out of a discussion Smoke has about Korean history because I can't contribute to it more than the average liberal.\n\nbut you should not be satisfied with that.

That you don't think I have is exactly why I said I take no issue with this perspective being shut out. \n\n\n2. It isn't really my intent or responsibility to decolonize your mind and present my own full analysis on the topic of black art. I already explained that I asked you all to stop spewing nonsense and develop your understanding more. To continue my Korea metaphor this would be like if instead of studying I just continued talking about some bullshit I read in a tabloid about North Korea when I was 14 and this served as the basis for the rest of the conversation's political understanding of Korea. \n\n\n\n3. I really hate explaining racism to non black people.  Unfortunately I have a narcissistic/idealistic delusion that it's worth trying to do. That or masochism. \n\n\n\n>I never said the music was only for the consumption of settlers\n\n\nOf course you didn't, you didn't have to. That's what I keep trying to say. Your original comments were among the least reactionary in this thread which is why I don't understand why you can't grasp this. \n\n\n\n>I do not say things like \"here is why this or that appeals to New Afrikans\n\n\n\n What I said is that you and all the other commenters consciously or unconsciously engage with African art through the lens of how it can be consumed by settlers. As such once you made the correct observation of \"Billy Woods is saying some fascist bullshit\" or \"There are numerous examples of reactionary garbage in Kendrick Lamar's music\" you have nothing more to contribute. Through continuing criticism through an undeveloped settler perspective you negate the African one.\n\n\nA good example of this would be /u/doonkerr's attempt to describe MMATBS's theme of infidelity. Racial self loathing combined with colonial imagery of the black beast ravaging the settler girl can create a real fetishization of white women as a form of self punishment or validation seeking. When I heard that for Kendrick it manifested in infidelity I didn't condone it but wasn't surprised. That is a theme that could resonate with a black person of any strata. I've seen this validation seeking in the American black bourgeoisie and I've seen it in East African homeless people. \n\n\n Instead we get \"he cheats on his wife lol.\" After reading that I'm embarrassed I held up his earlier criticisms of Woods. Any liberal could have said that shit. \n\n\n\n\n>but ultimately, I am just as capable of understanding things as someone like smokeuptheweed.\n\n\nThis is true and that's why I'm going to rescind my lazy appeal to authority that Smoke would have something much more valuable than you to contribute. They most likely would not. Now that I think about it I think I recall reading some comments they made months ago on the topic of Kendrick and I remember not being impressed. \n\n\n>but you should not be satisfied with that. I am not satisfied with my approach to art so I commented while highlighting my shortcomings in the hopes that my understanding could be advanced. if I just kept my thoughts in my head, this would never happen.\n\n\nThat's why I specifically said that you have already contributed all a settler can, and if you don't significantly advance you should be shut out. Even if it was my responsibility to teach you, what you're doing isn't trying to learn, it's justifying yourself. \nThe fact that you all have such a strong understanding of Marxism that you can use it to justify yourself makes it even more dangerous, but the fact that you are all Marxists is precisely why I am telling you this in good faith instead of filing it away with all the other drivel on reddit. \n\n\nUndeveloped settler critiques of black bourgeoisie eventually end up sounding like Klu Klux Klan watercooler talk. I am nipping that in the bud.",

Like I said, it was more about a song in specific and not about him as an artist overall. Besides, he also had reactionary songs too like one which is explicitly zionist \"neighborhood bully\". I admit that I do like some songs of his, but I'm definitely not his greatest fan nor anything like that.\n\nAbout Palestine, perhaps the best comparison would be Vietnam, no? But even then there are still differences, since the war affected americans in a more direct way, for example because of conscription, which perhaps \"forced\" artists to take a stance. Also, if I am indeed sad that Hip-Hop artists have not taken a position, it is only because I expected more from them because of the history of the genre. One would already expect silence from euro-american musicians.\n\nAbout the music industry, you make up good points which unfortunately I am not abilitated to comment on since I am just a casual listener. I remember the discussion about AI though, it was indeed interesting.\n\nRegarding female rappers, I confess that although I don't think that I have any prejudices against them, I end up not knowing many of them. I only know the really mainstream ones like Nicki or Cardi. Also since I do listen to some Three 6 Mafia Gangsta Boo, but that is it. I think I must explore that part of Hip-Hop more. About the male rappers you mentioned, I do like most of them, some I don't know very well.",

But, in my opinion, a lot of the art pieces throughout history which were indeed revolutionary (both in terms of content and of form) and were acknowledged*, had an impact on the direction that said art went. Some of Marx's and Engels' favorite artists are also some of the most famous artists of all time (Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, Dickens and Balzac retroactively in a way), and they all had a great impact on literature. I don't think that music that nobody likes and that people force themselves to listen to because it has \"important\" conscious lyrics (as some sort of penitence) can be any good. All this, of course, at the level of the individual listener; I understand that a communist party (especially one with state power) can promote artists that technically aren't that good for the purpose of founding a socialist artistic movement. Sort of as a \"beginning\". And, at the end of the day, the most important purpose of Art must be the way it serves the construction of socialism of course. But some of the greatest artists to come out of socialism, like Eisenstein, were indeed geniuses, and they too had an impact on art (including, in this case, on the art of the capitalist world).\n\n*A difference should be made between an artist which simply wasn't or is yet to be acknowledged, which means that the mainstream has simply not had any contact with the said artist (a truly underground artist); and an artist which has been acknowledged (in this case, been listened to), but has been ignored because the art of the said artist has nothing new artistically. Speaking of Fantano, the only album of Kanye that he has given a 10 is Kids See Ghosts (with Kid Cudi). It is probably the least impactful of Kanye's albums. At the same time, he gave a  5 to Yeezus, a much more interesting (in my opinion) and a much more impactful album.",

SGP's music is pretty reactionary and not just because of the obvious reason of the misogynistic and heterosexist lyrics, but also because the production style he is known for relies heavily on invoking nostalgia, although I think the production style on B.M.W is kinda cool. as I said, I am out of my depth here and you probably have better knowledge of the genre. though I don't think that disqualifies my opinion on Yeezus since I see it as quite comprador in its themes and it sounds like a migraine.",

Of older rappers I also like some NWA, Mos Def (Black Star too) and then rappers who mix (unfortunately) somehow good political commentary with religious talk like Outkast or Goodie Mob. Then there are rappers that I do listen to without them being explicitly political (althought there is always politics underneath) in their lyrics like UGK, Nas or even early Jay-Z (I know, I know). Of more recent ones I like Lupe Fiasco.\n\nBut what I am not sure about is whether artists must be explicitly progressive in the lyrics of their songs for us to consider their art good. For example, regarding other arts, if we read a book or see a movie where all the characters are reactionaries, we can understand that, throught the fascism of the said characters, a revolutionary image or a critique of capitalism can be constructed. Perhaps the same can be said of Hip-Hop (or music in general) where the politics of songs can go beyond what is displayed at face value in lyrics (or even beyond artists intentions).\n\nFor example, Jay-Z has always been a reactionary, that is true. But there is, in my opinion, some interest in seeing \"Black Capitalism\" as an ideology articulated so explicitly in his songs. When he says, \"I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti\", we see displayed the feelings of many (especially from opressed nations) young men, who see in mobsters the power and the wealth that they do not have in real life. In many of his songs (I'm mostly talking about his earlier albuns) he shows the violence and the malice that made possible him becoming wealthy through drug dealing. This is not a good picture, but it is unfortunately a real one. His cold \"Mafioso\" persona is also a challenge to the (of course false) stereotype that exists of black people as hotheaded: instead, when he portrays himself as a criminal (even if he was indeed a drug dealer in real life, its still a character) he is calm, never talks loud (Jay-Z basically never screams in his music) and a machiavellian planner. I think that too hmhas captivated admiration by some and hence why he became a model of \"sucess\". He is much more of a mobster (I would say that he resembles Michael Corelone) than a gangster. When he stopped with the criminal persona and changed to the self-made millionaire/billionaire, he retained many of these characteristics, although his music became less interesting, in my opinion.\n\nI think one could also see underneath Yeezus a critique through the obvious parody-like persona that he adopts throughout the album. The entire album has a more or less continuous sound and themes until we get to Bound 2, which seems completely out of place. The other songs (where he only talks about how many women he has had sex with, about not giving a fuck and even about being a god), are the shell that he built around him because he is scared of his true feelings, of the fact that he do gives a fuck and that he is in love.\n\nAll this are just my interpretations, of course, and I have also not studied the marxist theory of art, so what I said here can be wrong and I'll accept that. There is also the problem, as you mentioned it, of analysing production and determining which sounds are progressive or reactionary. I, also, am not equipped to talk about that, although your point about sounds that are nostalgic being reactionary is interesting and I believe true.",

Yet, during the whole thing with Drake, the feud was presented as \"Kendrick, the guy who is for the culture and represents the roots of Hip-Hop\" versus \"Drake, the guy who makes Pop songs and who is the product of a corporation\". There was also a big deal, in my opinion, of misogyny surrounding the whole thing: unfortunately for Drake, he committed the unforgivable sin of being \"feminine\" (all the lightskin jokes have to do with that). You mentioned Kendrick's misogyny, and that is also a good point. All this, of course, doesn't mean that I have Drake in high regard or whatever, although I do listen to him more. However, It is interesting that Lupe Fiasco and Jay Electronica, two of the rappers in the \"mainstream\" with some of the most interesting political songs, prefer Drake to Kendrick.",

Rap is a little too vast to make stylistic generalizations like that. I'm trying to think of any Kendrick song where he sounds like *Lollipop* or *Fireman* - hard to imagine. Of course, I think many of the 'viral' rappers of the last ten years owe a lot to Lil Wayne. But, they also owe the virality of rap in general to him anyway since he sort of transformed music releases putting out free mixtapes on Datpiff. I don't listen to much rap anymore (there's too much..), but I remember very distinct sounds between something like NYC rap and Memphis rap. Lil Wayne just sounded like Three Six Mafia to me when I was younger, for example. I'm not sure if geographic developments still occur with the era of streaming and virality and physical mixtapes don't exist anymore obviously. Someone genuinely good like Chief Keef can go viral and instantly there are a whole new crop of artists that pop up trying to mimic that sound, makes it very difficult to take any music seriously.",

But I'll try to summarize what I had written in my comment:\n\n1) Firstly, I would like to say that Kendrick himself recognizes Wayne's influence on his style, particularly in terms of his flow. Also, he is such a big fan of Wayne that he released an entire mixtape whose beats are from a Lil Wayne album, Carter 4 (if I am to be totally honest, I only found out this now during my research to reply to you ahaha)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8yfAUqc6ndI?feature=shared\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFvR2bZRQluxe1sa4-lpX8Q7u37ieaI81&feature=shared\n\n2) Secondly, I would like to say that it isn't all that important to my overall argument wether Kendrick's style is only influenced by Wayne or by other rappers too (like I said Tupac, or Andre 3000 or all the other rappers from Kendrick's region). I still think Wayne is the blueprint for most rappers and that means Kendrick too.\nBut the main point is that, in my opinion, he never (or rarely) goes beyond technically what had already been established. u/Sea_Till9977 in your opinion where do you find Kendrick to be original strictly from a technical point of view?\n\nAlso, u/PrivatizeDeez I don't think that Three Six Mafia have had that big of an impact on him. Perhaps only on his early work but he has later evolved since then. Or in a very general sense since that they basically invented trap, in which case that means that they influenced everybody.",

Most people abstract away from the object itself, so the differences between addiction to cigarettes, video games, heroin and sex are blurred, but more importantly the social context in which an object is repetitively consumed is ignored. Without that, it's hard to offer help or compare situations. \n\nI think the most valuable thing about 12 step programs in general is the social commitment. For the mainstream AA or NA programs, usually you're making a commitment to others that you're moving towards a new life of steady employment, perhaps religiosity, responsibility towards your kids, etc. And there's some accountability there, if you fail, you have to shamefully tell others that you've failed and make a plan for next steps. This is good. Where this goes wrong is when folks quit heroin and all their old problems (problems of capitalist society) are still waiting for them, these goals are unattainable - no job, no safe place to live, no family to help you get back on your feet (and why is it only your family whose responsible in the first place?). Point is: there's no \"revolutionary\" 12 step program without a revolutionary organization.",

This means they interpret things through the lens of liberalism and are basically blind to settler colonialism. As they noted, the thought reform r\u00e9gime was not aimed at making them into communists, just at understanding that their espionage activities were criminal and wrong. So they do not come out of the book as communists, but as liberals, and it shows.\n\n\nOne of the worst lines in the book is where the warden says\n\n\n>There\u2019s no conflict between the teachings of Christ and socialism.\n\n\nEven if the main thrust of the passage was fine, I don't think I need to expand here on how this statement is problematic and how easily it can be assimilated by revisionism.\n\n\nLet me quote another problematic passage:\n\n\n>Armed with their newly discovered theories and taking the course of the Chinese revolution as a universal example, they maintained vehemently in arguments with me that the United States must also some day go through a socialist revolution. Furthermore, since this change would undoubtedly be violently resisted by the present American rulers, whom they always referred to as Wall Street, the American people would be compelled to use force just as the Chinese had, in order to establish their new society.\n\n\n>I was willing to agree that when a society advanced to a certain stage public ownership of the means of production became necessary, and some form of socialism in the United States was inevitable. But I refused to admit that we would have to go through a period of bloody upheaval similar to that which the Chinese had experienced. After all, I argued, unlike China, we had a democratic tradition which provided a means for peaceful progress.\n\n\n>One day the discussion became heated. Ma especially, with his innate love for violence, insisted that my views were only the expression of reactionary bourgeois sentiments.\n\n\n>Finally, lips trembling with rage, I exploded. \u201cWe Americans are not going to have our country turned into a slaughter house like China was. We don\u2019t need socialism that much.\u201d\n\n\n>Ma\u2019s eyes burned dangerously dark as he leaned forward to thrust his face close to mine, but before he could carry his attack further Jiang cut in, \u201cMa, I think you had better lay off Li Ko. You\u2019re forgetting that he is an American. He had no right to interfere in China\u2019s affairs and for that reason is in prison. But we Chinese also have no right to tell him how his country should be run.\u201d\n\n\n>As Jiang\u2019s soft, even tone had its calming effect on both Ma and myself he continued, \u201cYou're forgetting also that Marxism is not a dogma. We Chinese had to adapt its basic principles to fit our specific conditions and the Americans will have to do the same. I don\u2019t know anything about the United States, but it is quite possible Li Ko is right.\u201d\n\n\nWe can put Jiang's awful response partly down to ignorance of the US, which is understandable, but his non-interventionism is just bourgeois formalism.\n\n\nThen there's the epilogue.\n\n\n>With all that has transpired in the past year in terms of world events and our own experience it would be impossible for us not to have undergone some change and development in our ideas.\n\n\nThis was written in early 1957 and so is referring to Khrushchov's denunciation of Stalin.\n\n\n>We found to our relief that America\u2019s democratic heritage had been rooted deeply enough to reject this development toward fascism and that McCarthy, as an individual, had been forced from the scene.\n\n\n...\n\n\n>To our minds, no matter how sincere in their purpose the authorities may be, in violating the principle of the right to know they are taking a dangerous step. It was the very fact that a small group was given the right to determine what people may or may not know which contnbuted to the abuses of Stalinism in the Soviet Union. One of the most encouraging recent developments in China has been a liberalization of this concept of a controlled press. The slogan \u201cLet the various schools of thought contend\u201d has led the newspapers and magazines to a much freer discussion of the pros and cons on a number of issues. In other words, the free and open discussion which had from the beginning existed on local issues is gradually being extended to the broad problems of national and international scope.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples, it's been a while since I read the book and I'm sure there are more. That said, I find more value in the book than harm and I personally enjoyed reading it.",

Pre-capitalist modes of production, while having fundamental systematic tendencies, are generally defined by the simple appropriation of surplus (except in primitive communism, in which surplus labor doesn't exist, at least in its early stages); on the other hand, the capitalist mode of production has a clear emergence in its operation, by which a simple understanding of the production of surplus-value is clearly insufficient (if necessary) to understanding its motion and contradictions. This is clearly a result of the operation of the law of value (which is dominant in the capitalist mode of production, but not in prior or later modes of production), but what is the fundamental dialectical logic between the existence of exchange-value and the almost kaleidoscopic complexity (at least from my perspective, having read only ten chapters of *Capital* Volume 1) of the capitalist system? I wouldn't be surprised if  Marx wrote about this somewhere, so I'd definitely appreciate a link to that if it exists.\n\nAnother question I have has to relate to the persistence of semi-feudal productive relations in imperialist states. I especially have Japanese imperialism in mind here, which until the US occupation in the 40s still had a sizable rural landlord class, with the contradiction between it and the exploited peasantry becoming especially intense in the 1920s (the underdeveloped relations of production in Southern Italy in the same period is perhaps a similar phenomenon). Is this a result of the bourgeois revolution of the 1870s in Japan being incomplete (with the dissolution of the *daimyo* and *samurai* as a feudal class, but without majorly affecting the underlying rural mode of production), with it only being completed by the abolition of these semi-feudal relations under the auspices of US Imperialism in 1945? How did this affect the Japanese market's ability to absorb commodities, and from there, how did it affect the development of the Japanese imperialist system? I can't say that I've done much investigation on the development and tendencies of bourgeois revolution (I haven't even seriously investigated the initial French Revolution!), so this is certainly a subject that requires investigation. Reading, both on bourgeois revolution in general and Japanese historical development in particular, would certainly be appreciated.",

                    "body": "> Marx begins that work with an examination of the surface appearance of use value and exchange value in the material act of commodity exchange and posits the\nexistence of value (an immaterial but objective relation) behind the quantitative aspect of exchange value. This value is initially taken to be a reflection of the social\n(abstract) labour congealed in commodities (chapter 1). As a regulatory norm in the market place, value can exist, Marx shows, only when and where commodity exchange has become \u201ca normal social act.\u201d This normalization depends upon the existence of private property relations, juridical individuals and perfectly competitive markets (chapter 2). Such a market can only work with the rise of monetary forms (chapter 3) that facilitate and lubricate exchange relations in efficient ways while providing a convenient vehicle for storing value. Money thus enters the picture as a material representation of value. Value cannot exist without its representation. In chapters 4 through 6, Marx shows that it is only in a system where the aim and object of economic activity is commodity production that exchange becomes a necessary as well as a normal social act. It is the circulation of money as capital (chapter 5) that consolidates the conditions for the formation of capital\u2019s distinctive value form as a regulatory norm. But the circulation of capital presupposes the prior existence of wage labour as a commodity that can be bought and sold in the market (chapter 6). How labour became such a commodity before the rise of capitalism is the subject of Part 8 of Capital, which deals with primitive or original accumulation.\n\nhttps://davidharvey.org/2018/03/marxs-refusal-of-the-labour-theory-of-value-by-david-harvey/\n\nThe way you should be looking at it is that Marx starts from appearance (exchange-value) then investigates its essence (value). Value has concrete effects on the world rather than being an accounting term, while exchange-value is only a reflection of those effects. The exposition of capital as a whole requires looking past appearance so we can ask other questions and dialectically move through the totality.\n\nFor example, how is value first invented, then created, and how does it circulate and self-valorize, becoming a real movement in society? Why does the value-form exist and how does the \u201cfreeing\u201d of labor play into that? How was labor \u201cfreed\u201d in the first place? How can value be invented by the labor process, the worker earn a wage which then re-encounters capital, while the value-product continues on in a value-chain until it\u2019s final consumption of lack thereof; and, if the end result\nof the value-chain is devaluation or \u201cde-use-valuing,\u201d how does that then propagate backward and affect not only the production process but the entire circulatory apparatus built on top? Some portion of the wages earned continue circulating prior to the consumption of the value-product and its final value as its socially-necessary labor-time at the moment of reproduction, and in this they essentially form rudimentary debt instruments which (for many reasons, including a variety of turnovers and investments) can crystallize and cause massive crises. \n\nIn the figure of exchange-value, we have none of this, exchange-value is just that something acts in commensurate with another to a definite quantity; we lose the massive swirl which takes us through valorization, primitive accumulation, crisis theory, credit systems and fictitious capital, etc.\n\nApart from David Harvey\u2019s monetaryism, he sums a lot of this up well enough. The article above was just the easiest thing I could cite, but Limits to Capital is better.",

If so, then it follows that capitalism is the qualitative level of development of human social existence in which the contradiction between the human capacity to consciously understand and mold reality, and the  practical shackling of human consciousness and action to the social conditions of its existence (both as a collective and manifested in individual humans, as an expression of the contradiction between the universal and particular), is most clearly realized.\n\nThe basis of the social existence of humanity is labor, and it is labor (the extent to which it can alter the world for human benefit, and the relations in which it is organized) that is the basis of all human consciousness; capitalism is the mode of production in which accumulated labor, manifested in the form of value, fully asserts itself autonomously as a social force: the contradiction, always latent through the entire existence of humanity (since the very acquiring, through labor, of its opposite aspect in this respect, consciousness, in the development of humanity as a species), is now here expressed in its fullest form. In short, the capitalist mode of production is the highest and most intense form of expression of the contradiction between labor and consciousness: the entire historical epoch is a crisis in the development of human social existence. Socialism, and its endpoint in Communism, is the resolution of this crisis, bringing the dissolution of the aspect of humanity's subjugation to necessity through enabling it to use its consciousness to *grasp* necessity, and to control it.\n\nFor all of human existence prior to now, the principal aspect was necessity, over consciousness: with socialism, the principal aspect shifts, with consciousness asserting itself over necessity, and coming to control it. This is the dialectical logic behind socialism being not only a qualitative break with capitalism, but with all of class society and prior human existence: it is the highest qualitative leap that humanity has ever experienced up to this point in its development, and will lead to the resolution of the principle contradiction of hitherto human existence.\n\nThis subject has subconsciously been bugging me for a while now, and now I can see it so clearly. Thank you for the spark.\n\nedit: I realize now that I'm actually just paraphrasing (or, rather, fully detailing the dialectical logic behind) Engels here, haha.

The end of capitalism doesn\u2019t come about through a fundamental contradiction (which you incorrectly called a principal contradiction) between the transhistorical categories of labor and consciousness. Capitalism is a system that can never exceed its own limits without becoming radically transmogrified. It\u2019s a limit to itself, immanently under its own rules. Surplus-labor isn\u2019t transhistorical but is instead something shared between all societies with economic formations.\n\n> Labour is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature. He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces, setting in motion arms and legs, head and hands, the natural forces of his body, in order to appropriate Nature\u2019s productions in a form adapted to his own wants.\n\n...\n\n> The elementary factors of the labour-process are 1, the personal activity of man,\u00a0i.e., work itself, 2, the subject of that work, and 3, its instruments.\n\n...\n\n> The labour-process, resolved as above into its simple elementary factors, is human action with a view to the production of use-values, appropriation of natural substances to human requirements; it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and Nature; it is the everlasting Nature-imposed condition of human existence, and therefore is independent of every social phase of that existence, or rather, is common to every such phase.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm\n\nLabor is directly subordinated to the material conditions upon which it acts in Marx\u2019s formulation of the labor-process. This determination means that labor doesn\u2019t exist as a category in the pure sense, but only contingently upon the social formation.\n\n> The basis of the social existence of humanity is labor, and it is labor (the extent to which it can alter the world for human benefit, and the relations in which it is organized) that is the basis of all human consciousness\n\nIt\u2019s actually Marx himself who warned against the elevation of labor, isolating it from its subordination to nature and turning it into the uniquely human ability of creativity.\n\n> Labor is\u00a0not the source\u00a0of all wealth.\u00a0Nature\u00a0is just as much the source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labor, which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labor power. The above phrase is to be found in all children\u2019s primers and is correct insofar as it is implied that labor is performed with the appurtenant subjects and instruments. But a socialist program cannot allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the\u00a0conditions\u00a0that lone give them meaning. And insofar as man from the beginning behaves toward nature, the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labor, as an owner, treats her as belonging to him, his labor becomes the source of use values, therefore also of wealth. **The bourgeois have very good grounds for falsely ascribing\u00a0supernatural creative power\u00a0to labor**\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm\n\n> capitalism is the mode of production in which accumulated labor, manifested in the form of value, fully asserts itself autonomously as a social force: the contradiction, always latent through the entire existence of humanity (since the very acquiring, through labor, of its opposite aspect in this respect, consciousness, in the development of humanity as a species), is now here expressed in its fullest form. In short, the capitalist mode of production is the highest and most intense form of expression of the contradiction between labor and consciousness: the entire historical epoch is a crisis in the development of human social existence.\n\nThe contradiction between the categories of labor and consciousness bring you to a vulgar humanism that imagines capitalism as a momentary interruption in the development of the species. This requires believing that there is a human essence that marches forward in the first place. Think more like Jameson: capitalism at one and the same time the greatest and worst thing to ever happen to humans. Communism isn\u2019t the real movement to liberate the species but instead a violent rupture that, like the Messiah, saves exactly one class: the proletariat. \n\nHave you read Reading Capital?\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1968/reading-capital/ch02.htm\n\nI\u2019m happy that you\u2019re engaging and thinking through these things, but now may be time for an intervention to come to an understanding of what it means to be anti-humanist in Marxism and how that affects your understanding of the development of capital.",

At the same time, though, I probably wasn't clear enough in my initial formulation: I simply left some things, which I didn't think needed to be explicitly articulated, for granted.\n\nFor instance: obviously I don't believe that capitalism will \"transcend its limits\" due to a fundamental contradiction of human existence, without proletarian struggle and revolution. That would be absolutely monstrous revisionism, and I assumed that (since we're in a serious Marxist space), I didn't need to explicitly re-affirm one of the most basic theses of Marxism. Nor do I think that capitalism is a \"momentary interruption in the development of the species\". Perhaps I didn't make this clear enough, but I posited that the capitalist mode of production is that stage in the development of human social existence in which the fundamental antagonism that I suggested *is most fully realized*, not when it first comes to exist.\n\nWhen I write that capitalism is \"a crisis\", I didn't mean it in the sense that it's an interruption of prior development (which it is not; capitalism is of course a product of the past development of human social existence, particularly of the contradictions of the feudal mode of production); rather, I meant that, like how an overproduction crisis is a \"crisis\" because it's the most intense manifestation of the fundamental capitalist contradiction between social labor and private appropriation, capitalism is a \"crisis\" because it's the maximal intensification of the contradiction between the subjection of the motion of human social existence to the implications of its productive capacity, and the human (this is not negating the centrality of class contradiction within capitalism, and class society as a whole, or in any way \"humanistic\"; it just refers to the human mind's *capability* of grasping necessity, even if class necessity itself intervenes on the mind and prevents it from doing so) capacity to understand the social conditions of existence, and to change them.\n\nRegarding \"human essence\", I obviously don't uphold that metaphysical, bourgeois conception. Nonetheless, the social development of *Homo Sapiens* as a species, and the contradictions which define that development, can be scientifically understood. Likewise, while of course the socialist revolution is a proletarian revolution, and in the immediate to mid-term serves to liberate only the proletariat and other revolutionary classes, it's end state is the negation of class contradictions as a whole; through making all of humanity proletarian, the proletariat will cease to exist as a meaningful label as opposed to simply \"humanity\". How, then, is the proletarian revolution *not* a movement for the liberation of the spcies as a whole, even if said liberation can occur only in the long-term? Given the immediate tasks of the present, my fixation on this topic is very possibly a petty-bourgeois tendency, but how could it possibly be undialectical to investigate the contradictions which drive the development of human social existence in general (of which class society is only a period of)?\n\nAs regards your point on labor (while I did appreciate being reminded of the potential bourgeois mystification of labor), I think that my wording was unclear, which effected your interpretation of what I was trying to say (and this is something that deserves criticism: clarity is essential). What I meant was the human *capacity* to perform labor introduces the system of human social existence as a qualitatively distinct (if inevitably dialectically linked) process from the biosphere, and *also* spurs the development the enhanced human cognition (deriving from the need to master the labor-process) in deriving knowledge from practice. Upon reconsideration, I was wrong to consider the capacity to labor as being decisive in binding humanity to necessity (since non-laboring animals, after all, have their actions and development also determined by the contradictions of their environment), but this capacity to labor *does* introduce the possibility of a qualitative shift in this relation to necessity.\n\nI hope I have made myself clearer. I would definitely appreciate further criticism, especially if what I've just written doesn't actually break from the errors that you saw in the first post.",

How, then, is the proletarian revolution not a movement for the liberation of the spcies as a whole, even if said liberation can occur only in the long-term?\n\nThe *species* is a difficult category to work with exactly because it leads to leaps like these. While it\u2019s true that it\u2019s correct to consider humans a species insofar as they are homo sapiens, homo sapiens as a category has nothing to do with class society and revolution, and the species isn\u2019t the groundwork from which we make our analysis even of people after the dissolution of class society.\n\nHumans aren\u2019t \u201cproletarian\u201d at least not in the pure sense, since we all contain internal contradictions and can shift between class perspectives and transform into our opposites. The proletarian class exists in the abstract and revolutionary potential is immanent from the proletarian worldview. To make everyone proletarian can only mean to abolish all non-proletarian classes, at which point classes cease to exist, but as opposed to this becoming two uniting into one, contradiction remains.\n\n> It is obviously incorrect to maintain as some people do, that the contradiction between idealism and materialism can be eliminated in a socialist or communist society. As long as contradictions exist between the subjective and the objective between the advanced and the backward and between the productive forces and the conditions of production, the contradiction between materialism and idealism will continue in a socialist or communist society and will manifest itself in various forms. Since man lives in society he reflects in different circumstances and to varying degrees the contradictions existing in each form of society. Therefore not everybody will be perfect, even when a communist society is established. By then there will still be contradictions among the people, and there will still be good people and bad people, people whose thinking is relatively correct and others whose thinking is relatively incorrect. Hence there will still be struggle between people though its nature and form will be different from those in class societies. Viewed in this light the existence of contradictions between the individual and the collective in a socialist society is nothing strange...\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-7/mswv7_466.htm\n\nSo even at the highest stage of communist development, people are still categorized in society not by anthropological terms but by whatever structural forces interpellate them. \u201cHumanity\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d aren\u2019t helpful in the overwhelming majority of Marxist analyses.",

Most people are wage earners in the United States. White people still suffer from capitalism too, although they do enjoy much more privilege than other groups, especially cis het white men.\n\nWages that are massively inflated by imperialism, which allow Americans to live relatively comfortably and eventually earn even more superprofits (by joining the petite bourgeoisie, buying a computer and becoming a content creator, investing in stock, etc.). This qualitatively makes them a different class because they earn more than what they produce and are not the revolutionary class who has nothing to lose but their chains. Like I'm typing this right now on a child labor machine made by the actual proletariat and I'm an average American, how could you possibly compare the two groups?\n\n>White people aren\u2019t a \u201cclass\u201d either. We can\u2019t even agree historically or contemporarily who is considered white.\n\n  \nCorrect. I'm using that as shorthand for the labor aristocracy and also because when you say it that way it makes people realize how silly they sound, like yeah dude, let's go tell white Americans that they should go leave their suburbs and go join the people's war. Sure, some of them probably will (this subreddit is evidence of that, but of course, internet posting is way lower stakes than taking up arms so let's see how it actually plays out) but never as a full class. \n\nAnd yes, whiteness is expanded or limited, but that is not because we all collectively disagree on what whiteness is, but because the definition of whiteness changes depending on the needs of capitalism at the time (e.g. immigrants from Europe being integrated into whiteness).\n\n>For the SocDems, it depends. A lot of Americans, white and non-white, are social democrats because they believe in leftist policy but communism has been so demonized their whole lives that they don\u2019t read theory. Others, like the FDR types, want to preserve the class structure.\n\nWrong, and SocDem/DemSoc policy is social fascism, not communist policy, so of course they support it. The actual answer is that these people are the aforementioned labor aristocracy/petite bourgeoisie (same thing basically, IMO there isn't really a meaningful line separating them that much, especially in consciousness, but maybe another user can correct me on that) and their inflated wages and settler position leads to a change in consciousness that manifests as social fascist policy (e.g. let's use the funds gotten from the Third World for free healthcare and do nothing else). \n\nAgain, the whole point of Marxism is that material existence as a class determines its social consciousness, a class' politics stems from where they stand in the material world. The people at the top (as a class, again, individuals might differ) have no reason to revolt, they only wish to reform the system to meet their needs, and you're confusing this for a lack of political education, rather than admitting that they perfectly understand where they stand in the world and what they want, even if they can't articulate consciously why.",

I believe it was u/smokeuptheweed9 who has touched on this before, but I think that remembering Gramsci\u2019s famous saying is important here.\n\n>You must realize that I am far from feeling beaten\u2026it seems to me that\u2026 a man ought to be deeply convinced that the source of his own moral force is in himself \u2014 his very energy and will, the iron coherence of ends and means \u2014 that he never falls into those vulgar, banal moods, pessimism and optimism. My own state of mind synthesises these two feelings and transcends them: my mind is pessimistic, but my will is optimistic. Whatever the situation, I imagine the worst that could happen in order to summon up all my reserves and will power to overcome every obstacle.\n\nAs Marxists, we need to analyze reality soberly. If this means that the situation is a pessimistic one, we are confronted with the question of whether we give up or continue forward. This fundamental question has confronted every communist throughout history, and great communists are the ones who continue to struggle and move forward even in the most dire of circumstances. What comes to mind for me here is Lenin after the defeat of the 1905 revolution and during WW1 or Mao after the Shanghai Massacre. It\u2019s not so simple to think ourselves out of being pessimistic. Contradictions in thought are the reflection of objective contradictions in reality, so we are brought to the task of changing our real conditions of existence to solve this contradiction in the mind. I can\u2019t provide you a blueprint to accomplish this. It ultimately falls on you to confront whatever reality has presented.\n\nPerhaps this isn\u2019t the answer you wanted to hear, as you asked for \u201cgood news\u201d but for a Marxist, all news is \u201cgood news\u201d in that we can draw lessons and learn from it.",

Use your own judgement to eliminate groups that are there to shill for the Democrats (or Republicans), those without any purpose except to recruit young people as a source of funds, those with no interest in what's actually going on around them and are just selling newspapers, those pushing the right-most line on others, and those that seem off at an instinctual level.\n\nThen use the power of the internet to eliminate from that the parties that seemed ok but were actually just better salespeople, those that have no vision except protesting, those with a fundamentally revisionist concept of Marxism, those with a history of internal sexual assault (though those should be eliminated in round one to a trained eye), and anything else you can find. I'm sure something will be left and, if not, it's better than joining a reactionary organization like the CPUSA. Though it may be that the org that's left is not a strictly communist organization but a single-issue one, in which case you'll have to build from the ground up. It shouldn't be too hard though, it's not like Palestinians solidarity activists haven't heard of Marxism before, they've just been disappointed by revisionists too many times to bother. \n\nE: this is all useless if you are not yourself able to distinguish between revisionism and revolutionary Marxism. Luckily you don't have to be an expert on philosophy, these differences play out in a very visible way on the ground and anyone with a brain can tell the CPUSA is fundamentally revisionist as you have (including its members - their problem is not a lack of intelligence). Still, you will save years of your life in the future if today you study Marxism now. Looking at your post history you're an aimless ball of rage which is necessary but not sufficient and easily rolled down the wrong hill. Even the best communist work will take a long time, you need to be able to distinguish political lines beyond merely rejecting electoral spectacle. I'm not sure what inspired you to post here for the first time but you should engage beyond treating this as the yelp of communist parties.

This is a chance for you to reflect on the fundamental flaws in your concept of the internet (and really speech in general). You did not make that concept up, you inherited it from libertarians at the origin of the medium. But the basic idea that anyone should be free to post anything and the role of moderation is to be reactive and minimally invasive, and to do otherwise is to create a \"circle jerk\" or be \"ban happy\" is fundamentally flawed. As I pointed out already, words have consequences, and the result your ideas is harassment, manipulation by horrible people, repetition of lies as truth, and low quality discussion. This is common sense when discussing the Fox News tactic of \"just asking questions\" and the amount of energy and intelligence it takes to counter the most vulgar lies that, once asked, are already spread, but when it comes to your own lack of effort and credulity suddenly all speech must be tolerated.\n\n>What's fascinating is that these ideas, which simply substitute the word \"internet\" for \"free market,\" are so hegemonic that they are even more powerful among so called \"socialists.\" Fascists at least cynically understand how to manipulate the libertarian foundations of the internet for their own narrow interests.",

On some occasions, you actually do find an interesting topic or question or someone seeking an insight and for whatever reason failed to find their way here to get an actual answer, so it's an opportunity to intervene against the hegemonic responses of those subreddits.

I think I'm also masochistic, but it can be fun to try to single handedly take on the world in a reddit tavern brawl, like you're Wolverine and you just picked a fight with everyone in some Alaskan pub.  Some of my favourite threads I've ever participated in are the ones where I begin at a negative 100 upvote deficit having pissed off everyone, but as the thread drags on, and counter-points are exposed and overcome, by a half dozen or so posts later, the five or ten people still participating at length have switched sides and my point now stands unchallenged, like *Twelve Angry Men.*   Plus when you've spent time and effort there it's still fun to go back occasionally and participate, and even keep up with the couple of good users that you like there who also sometimes make brave, worthwhile, or interesting posts that dont succumb to reddit liberalism.  Also (though this may be veering too close to liberalism myself here), those subreddits are also the more likely landing zones for actual beginners, and simply presenting them with something more challenging and daring and radical than the safe and comforting posts they are being spoonfed might help to lead them here where they might end up with better ideas instead watching their communist-sapling left to rot among the revisionism with no pathway to escape.  But most of all, these subreddits sometimes do move too slowly (which isn't a bad thing objectively, only inconvenient subjectively, especially when one find themselves with free time at work and little else to do) and sometimes you really want to participate and share some insight you just learned and the only place that's open late at 3am with active threads is McSocialism, despite it's nutritional deficiency.",

This is why the Chinese government kept both the Yuan and HK dollar stable against the US dollar whereas every other currency was devalued.\n\nTo your point, china could do this because the fundamentals were already sound for export growth (meaning it was still vastly underdeveloped compared to potential profits) whereas there was room for \"creative destruction\" in the rest of Asia, partially because Japanese finance was itself a bubble compared to its economic fundamentals (level of monopoly capitalist development). China was both more independent of Japanese finance and, through historical luck, was able to drain the forces of production from Hong Kong. Not to cry for the Hong Kongers, they got to become financial parasites and export manufacturing had already been in terminal decline before this. But the handover of Hong Kong is nevertheless significant and rare in history. Though it's not like the Chinese bourgeoisie took the forces of production from Hong Kong and brought them to the mainland as the USSR did with Easter Germany, all they did was continue the pattern of outsourcing to Guangdong that was already happening and make sure it continued. It would be like if China conquered the US and the only thing they did was restore Obama as a puppet president who had to restore free trade agreements and encourage Apple and ASML to stay in China. That's how narrow their vision is \n\nI bring it up nevertheless because the crisis greatly accelerated the pattern of Easter Asian neoliberalism and centralized the whole process in mainland China. That process is coming to an end, it is China that needs creative destruction and global manufacturing is again looking for a regional solution and China is looking to the past for alternatives, in this case to use the legal status of Taiwan to repeat the Hong Kong experience.\n\nAs for Thailand, which is u/AltruisticTreat8675's interest, I'll point out that simple gdp-per-capita data is not that useful. Looking at it you would think China has easily surpassed Thailand. But if you look more closely at the geographical pattern of manufacturing they are pretty similar. For example Rayong, which is where cars are manufactured for global companies, has a similar (or even slightly higher) gdp per capita to Beijing and Shanghai. The difference is the inability of Thailand to generalize the technology transfer in Rayong to a national system of proletarianization and interlinked export manufacturing. As the result BYD, which basically didn't exist 5 years ago, opened its first overseas plant in Rayong\n\nhttps://www.nationthailand.com/business/automobile/40039381\n\nWhereas Thailand has no equivalent IP of its own. However one should not overestimate China's accomplishments. The actual market for EVs without heavy state subsidies in the domestic Chinese market is at best highly speculative, this is not a repeat of Toyota or Hyundai (the latter of which was already a shadow of the former given Toyota became the high end of vehicles whereas Hyundai became the middle to low tier).\n\nhttps://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/asean-countries-confront-chinese-export-glut\n\nAnd I mean speculative in the Asian financial crisis sense\n\n>The Kiel Institute recently found that direct and indirect (e.g., cheap land, credit and power) industrial subsidies in China are up to nine times greater than in the United States relative to overall GDP.\n\nThis is debt that will turn bad very quickly if it is not realized overseas, which I think there is little chance of happening given the fundamental basis is nonsense (that EVs will somehow affect global warming and are therefore objectively necessary, in reality capitalism itself is the cause of global warming and EVs are just a gimmick)\n\nEven if successful, Thailand is close to China's technology level so it competing in the same market would be a matter of years, not decades. Already Vietnam is competing in the EV space and is only a few years behind despite being significantly more undeveloped overall. \n\nAnd there is a more fundamental problem as that article points out\n\n>The gamut of affected sectors is much broader than higher-value-added goods du jour such as electric vehicles (EVs). In 2023, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping made it clear that he wanted a \u201cmodern industrial system\u201d to extend to traditional labour-intensive sectors such as apparel, toys and furniture. Instead of migrating offshore to lower-cost destinations, the risk is that these operations will remain in China in an increasingly automated form.\n\nThis is basically delusional, automation has already reached the level that is possible given the level of current technology, if labor from Bangladesh could be replaced with robots it would not have been outsourced in the first place. The CCP understands that to maintain those GDP per capita numbers to exceed Thailand (and prevent the economy from becoming a few export zones in a sea of rural stagnation) a few higher value added heavy industries are not going to cut it or replace the property bubble in restoring the rate of profit. Trying to keep the entire world economy, from cutting edge technology to simple light manufactures, in a single country is impossible even if there was an extra population of 200 million willing to migrate from the countryside to work in sweatshops (which there isn't). That's not to predict the collapse of China, there is clearly still room for growth and the Chinese market is so large that it feels the effects of the falling rate of profit much more slowly (though there is no longer a population able to repeat the initial stage of primitive accumulation that came with the weaponization of the Hukuo system by global capital, the majority of the population is still very poor). \n\nRather, the centralization of global manufacturing that followed the Asian financial crisis in China and brought to an end the Japanese ASEAN alternative is reaching the limit (though Japan remains humbled). This may come with the first crisis of Chinese capitalism, the profit reckoning that it avoided in 1997. Because we are politically hostile to China, economists constantly predict its collapse so there is pleasure in debunking these baseless ideas. But those of us who are more familiar with the fundamentals understand that predictions of immanent collapse are just as useless as predictions of forever growth, as was what was regularly claimed about Asia before 1997 and the \"developmental state\" as the perfect fusion of capitalism and state regulation (and all the nonsense about Japanese flying geese). Just as it was clear by 1993 that there had been a fundamental shift in South Korea's economy to everyone except economists, the fundamental shift in China's economy is again clear to everyone but them, who like Trotskyists will take credit for its crisis that they already predicted should have happened decades ago.",

And why Thailand couldn't repeat the SK experience. \n\n> Thailand is close to China's technology level\n\nRight, this is true and the people who like to gloss over China's underdevelopment while they're bashing Thailand are not even Dengists, they are internet Chinese nationalists who intentionally cherry picked few examples like coastal cities and few high-value heavy industries to make up for its actual rural underdevelopment (Thailand is worse though since it involved regional and ethnic discriminations, not unlike when the capitalist roaders de-collectivized Chinese agriculture but the end results are the same).",

Obviously it didn't survive 1989 and the Chinese bourgeoisie's response after the Tiananmen Square incident is to privatize the remaining state-owned enterprises even more, destroying \"TVEs\" in countryside to open the floodgate of labor and the deindustrialization of the Northeast. My interest is about Thailand specifically and why it was a failure, but the garbage theories bourgeois academia has spouted since 1997 doesn't inspire me any confidence.",

I understand we're not competing with thedeprogram for the same audience and if someone posts here, they are already inclined towards taking Marxism seriously because of objective circumstances in their life. \n\nStill, that doesn't mean thedeprogram is hegemonic. It is simply suited for social media. Actual communist politics are immune and continue to function in indifference. It is a matter of mismatched tempos (victories and defeats of the people's war simply don't have the same appeal, though perhaps online Maoists could be like \"5 policemen killed in Chhattisgarh, chad Ajith keeps winning\") and I talk about it because I assume the KKE or CPI(Maoist) have better things to do.",

And i do not say this chauvinistically: It would be far better to argue with left liberals and confront them in our politics than right liberals pretending as leftists. It still is better to argue with a anarchist that at least is not the image of western anarchism and follows some kind of \"platformism\" that rejects \"electoralism\" and voting, than with a anarchist who tails the government but posture as not doing it, while saying corny lines like \"it slows down \"\"fascism\"\" to vote on PT, and it is a way to fight for trans or black rights\".",
