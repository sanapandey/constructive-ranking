Marx and Engels consistently wrote about the Labour aristocracy benefitting from colonialism in Europe. Lenin's writing really clarified this notion in \"imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism\", applying Marxist analysis to modern material conditions to show how when European capitalist become monopolies in their own markets they work with states to enrich their countries via pillaging the global south.\n\nSo basically Marx did predict that standards of living would increase in European capitalist countries, but much of this development was expropriated from the resources and labour of the global south.",

            "body": "There are flaws in your question that need to be addressed before it can be answered. It's a very common mistake to hear that \"the primary class conflict of Capitalism is between the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat\" and think it means there are only two classes in capitalism. But Marx never made this claim. The use of the non political word \"worker\" to describe a political class of people is outdated and makes it impossible to discuss accurately. The CEO of Microsoft works. Corporate lawyers work. White gold miners in northern Canada work and get paid enough to become petty landlords. People in Bangladeshi textile factories work. Clearly we can't paint them all with the same brush. Your question needs to use the word Proletariat, at which point the answer is clear: conditions have not improved for that class. They instead just don't exist in sizeable numbers in the imperial core.\n\n\nNow, if we ask a further question \"did Marx predict positive outcomes for the imperial working class (now called the labour aristocracy)?\", the answer is that he didn't need to predict it. He observed it's existence in his time. You can look through the volumes of Capital, or his manuscripts on Irish colonization. You can also see Engels work in \"Conditions of the Working Class in England\". Going a step further, Lenin even covers it in examples like \"Imperialism and the split in Socialism\" or even as early as \"New Economic developments in peasant life\".\n\nWhile a certain anti-theory tendency is starting to take hold in these parts it is still extremely important to familiarize yourself with at least Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Assumptions are made that can be easily dissuaded by the source.",

For example a poor working class person sees a big limousine and thinks he can never own it.Thats all and he moves on with his next task.\nIn western countries - a worker is slave to market economy. He is made to think falsely that he can own that limousine and bungalow if he works hard to achieve those dreams. He should be sacrificing his familiy,social life to achieve those dreams. While this might be true for 0.1 pct people, its false promise for rest. Does it raise productivity of society ? Absolutely it does.\nDoes it make lives better for average Joe ? Certainly not.",
