            "body": "While it is true that Singapore is a colonial outpost in Malaysia, I'm not sure this is the most fruitful area of revolutionary agitation. Singapore is basically a failed state, in the sense that it cannot fulfill the basic tasks of the bourgeoisie posed by the French Revolution: a common legal system, a common labor market in a territory, a singular national identity based on a series of common duties and benefits. While this is rarely the case de-facto, Singapore is one of the few states where this is the case de-jure, and the existence of the state relies on a population of nearly 1/3 who have no rights at all (2 million in a population of 6 million). This is comparable to an oil rentier state like Saudi Arabia and is very different than a normal capitalist nation-state, even Taiwan or Israel. Those states are apartheid regimes and colonial outposts but have successfully integrated new populations into the regime (Mizrahi Jews in Israel and the \"democratic\" movement in Taiwan which ended the repression of the colonial era labor aristocracy that the KMT had implemented during the long white terror). The \"national\" population of Singapore is stuck and will only grow smaller compared to the slave population.\n\nThere are many examples during decolonization of minority populations that fought for communist revolution for the state as a whole. Chinese communists in Malaysia and Thailand for example. In other places, this usually took the form of movements for national liberation (Eritrea or East Timor) but sometimes a single ethnic group that had been cultivated by colonialism turned against it and became the ruling class (Nigeria or Syria). The US of course has a long history of engaging with the \"black national question.\" These are of limited applicability and have few successes besides, but the point is that communism has had to engage with minorities that are revolutionary against a defeated or just indifferent majority. In the 20th century, this was expressed through nationalism, but Singapore shows that the politics of the 21st century will be constituted by disparate, migratory populations who lack even the legal basis for a nation or a common market. This is their weakness but also their strength: a revolutionary uprising in Singapore has direct connections to nearly every oppressed nation in the world and will resonate in the Philippines, Malaysia, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, etc. And it will inherit a country with advanced technology, which it will presumably share with all those countries. The endpoint is still a revolution that encompasses Malaysia, both for strategic reasons of conducting people's war and building a socialist country not founded on exploitation of the third world (despite its advanced technology, what sustains Singapore's decadent system of citizenship is financial parasitism which would disappear). But if I were in Singapore, I would start with the non-citizen population and extend outwards into Malaysia rather than start in Malaysia and encircle Singapore, since the non-citizen population has its own internal relationship to superexploitation to which the history of colonialism in Malaysia is limited.\n\nE: I forgot to mention that Malaysia is itself a colonial formation. The position of the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) on its formation was clear as were the sides in the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation (domestically and internationally). Unfortunately that whole history has been forgotten because the fascist coup in Indonesia was so horrible that it made Malaysia look not so bad. But the point is that decolonization in Southeast Asia was more complicated than simple colonial oppression vs. national liberation. The British were very successful at linking nominal independence to anti-communism and left behind nations with no chance of escaping neocolonial dependency.",

This make me think of Creative Technology which once a challenger to Apple after its initial success in sound cards but it was a failure.\n\nYeah, in terms of attempting indigenous technology, the early 1990s was the peak. The failure of Suzhou Industrial Park is infamous as well, as it was supposed to transcend the haphazard nature of the first wave of investors in China and develop controlled, state-to-state manufacturing outsourcing. Instead it showed how little control the Chinese central government actually has over economic activity.\n\nWhat followed was complete capitulation to becoming a financial hub, I won't deny that. But ironically, the unique system of Singaporean semi-slavery has actually made it attractive to multinational companies in the last few years since there is no danger of ip theft or being undercut on labor\n\nhttps://archive.ph/ogujl\n\n>Singapore has aggressively wooed highly automated factories with tax breaks, research partnerships, subsidized worker training and grants to local manufacturers to upgrade operations to better support multinational companies, among other enticements.\n\n>There\u2019s a caveat: Singapore\u2019s success has come by automating away many jobs. \n\n>It has more factory robots per employee than any country other than South Korea, according to the International Federation of Robotics.\nThe manufacturing sector\u2019s share of Singapore\u2019s employment declined to 12.3% last year from 15.5% in 2013. The number of manufacturing workers has shrunk for eight years straight.\n\n>**The country of 5.5 million people has long relied on migrant labor to bolster its worker ranks, so unlinking factories from jobs offers an economic benefit without hurting local employment rates.**\n\nThat's an opaque way to say Singapore wants manufacturing without proletarianization of either the migrant labor force or the citizen financial aristocracy. The result is automation and being a safe place for foreign investment compared to China\n\n>Executives also say they trust intellectual-property protection laws in Singapore, unlike in places like China where they sometimes worry their partners will copy their products.\n\nGlobalfoundries is an example of this new position in global manufacturing and I think part of the reason why Singapore, which was politically \"neutral\" for decades, took the unprecedented step of sanctioning Russia. I think the CEO of Tiktok using his Singaporean status as a shield from criticism probably scared the ruling class as well, I think it will soon take more concrete steps to comply with US political pressure on China.\n\n>Can you explain? \"to which since the history of colonialism in Malaysia is limited\"?\n\nWhile there are many Malay workers in Singapore, a movement which centers on Malayan labor across the region and restoring a greater Malaysian nationalism has little to offer Filipino guest workers. As the Malaysian economy has developed, it too has Filipino workers with few rights (among others). To be honest, this is part of a general difficulty for communist thought in navigating the nature of globalization. We accept that\n\n>By engaging in the conquest of Ireland, Cromwell threw the English Republic out the window.\n\nIs the same true of South Africa, which has seen the rise of regionalism and violence against migrants from poorer African countries as the ANC's bourgeois revolution failed to contain capitalism in the nation-state? Or Mexico, which under AMLO has increasingly leveraged its intermediate position for labor migration to win some \"social democractic\" gains from the US for its own population? Singapore is an extreme example but all countries will have to face the international intermixing of the \"domestic\" working class.",

Most of them are from Myanmar but also Cambodia and Laos. As much as I love to make fun of white sexpats (since these people are endemic to reddit) these migrant workers are actually revolutionary subjects and I don't see any mainstream bourgeois political party here consider integrating them into bourgeois political space, thus depriving them of their political rights and is forced to live under a terror. Only Move Forward is serious about this but since they're a social-fascist party with its urban petty-bourgeois base I doubt they can sustain it beyond a rhetoric.",

We've been discussing Venezuela in the last few days but no one has really accounted for the 8 million Venezuelan migrants across the region except for fascists in the American Republican party. Those who have noted the at best indifference of even \"progressive\" leaders in Brazil, Columbia, and Mexico to the election and attempted coup dismiss them as not very progressive in the first place. Which is true, Gustavo Petro is no Hugo Chavez. But to what extent have Venezuelan migrants threatened the social fascism of \"pink tide\" welfare? How much has it enabled it? Unlike Turkey, which has treated Syrian migrants as war refugees and kept them separate from the economy as much as possible (though they have still fundamentally affected the economy), Venezuelans are basically all employed as cheap labor in Columbia and have integrated into the economy. Maduro 's leadership of a greatly dimished nation is of less interest to me than this massive international proletariat, raised on the values of Chavismo and too large to get selective anti-communist privileges.\n\n>Thanks. I admit I dismiss Globalfoundries fabs in Singapore as merely an impossibility as I don't think the semi-slave labor system in Singapore can sustain semiconductor manufacturing. Reading that quote help clear my head up.\n\nUltimately it's a gimmick, like the previous Emerati ownership of GlobalFoundries. I'm telling this to the OP because they are from Singapore and there is always a possibility of revolution with the right political line, but it is indeed very remote. I'm more interested in how the evolution of Singapore into its current system reflects the wider trends we are discussing. If there is any truth to the concept of \"neo-feudalism\" it is the breakdown of bourgeois common law for a dual regime of labor and the possible future form of labor once China is purged from the system.",
