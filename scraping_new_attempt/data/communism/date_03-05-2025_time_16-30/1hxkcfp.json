You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                    "body": "John Brown, who apparently had no thoughts on indigenous genocide/replacement facilitating the European surplus labor to capitalist farmer pipeline, a mechanism unavailable to any other civilization ever and without which (among other likewise unique advantages external to its metabolic order) capitalism would be dead on arrival. But I imagine he \"hits different\" for American whites so why not. Nevertheless, *Settlers*:\n\n>If the clearing away of the Indian nations had unlocked the door to the spread of the slave system, so too it had given an opportunity to the settler opponents of the planters. And their vision was not of a reborn Greek slaveocracy, but of a brand-new European empire, relentlessly modern, constructed to the most advanced bourgeois principles with the resources of an entire continent united under its command. This new Empire would not only dwarf any power in Old Europe in size, but would be secured through the power of a vast, occupying army of millions of loyal settlers. This bourgeois vision could hardly be considered crackpot, since 20th Century Amerika is in large part the realization of it, but the vision was of an all-European Amerika, an all-white continent.\n\n>We can only understand the deep passions of the slavery dispute, the flaring gunfights in Missouri and \"Bloody Kansas\" between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers, and lastly the grinding, monumental Civil War of 1861-1865, as the final play of this greatest contradiction in the settler ranks. It was not freedom for Afrikans that motivated them. No, the reverse. It was their own futures, their own fortunes. Gov. Morton of Ohio called on his fellows to realize their true interests: \"We are all personally interested in this question, not indirectly and remotely as in a mere political abstraction-but directly, pecuniarily, and selfishly. If we do not exclude slavery from the Territories, it will exclude us.\"  \n...\n\n>All tendencies of the Abolitionists contained not only those who defended the human rights of Afrikans, but also those who publicly or privately agreed that Afrikans must go... *Rev. Theodore Parker was one of the leading spokesmen of radical abolitionism, one who helped finance John Brown's uprising at Harper's Ferry, and who afterwards defended him from the pulpit. Yet even Parker believed in an all-white Amerika; he firmly believed that: \"The strong replaces the weak. Thus, the white man kills out the red man and the black man. When slavery is abolished the African population will decline in the United States, and die out of the South as out of Northampton and Lexington.*\"\n\nSwami Sahajanand is a similar figure in India but in some crucial respects radically different. In fact closer to Malcolm X than Brown. He began his career struggling to socially upgrade the caste of Bhumihars via class collaboration and turned it into a general struggle against the landlords. Eventually sidelined by middle and rich peasants in the Kisan Sabha, revered today as a hero of the ultra-reactionary Bhumihar community and amalgamated into the pantheon of upper caste anti-colonials \"social reformers\" like Vivekananda.\n\nHis principled leadership had nothing to do with guilt or heroic sacrifice but the objective class-character of the struggle he was a part of. Guilt in particular is a very modern and capitalist emotion which hadn't really developed to a great degree in pre-independence semi-feudal India, although Swami Vivekanand was a pioneer hence his popularity in the west. We've come a long way since then as I've noticed quite a few \"I feel guilty about privilege/wealth\" posts by Indians on par with the basedest of white suburbanite sermons.",

                            "body": "So this is actually an interesting thing to deconstruct. In an attempt at self-criticism, this person posted this\n\n>Hey there, I used to make throwaway accounts pretending to be a communist and saying the most outrageous shit I could imagine to make communists look like murderous psychopaths. I could see the correct reasoning behind what the communists on the notorious anti revisionist subreddits were saying, but the idea of rejecting individualism and being willing to sacrifice myself made me uncomfortable, and they\u2019re also notoriously verbally abusive and claim that they\u2019re obligated as Marxists to verbally abuse me (see the \u201cno tone policing\u201d rule, and their whole 101 subreddit which is not meant for 101-level understanding but instead is clearly a honeypot to lure in liberals and \u2018polemicize against\u2019 (verbally abuse) them); so I lashed out by trying to bait them into agreeing with me that all white men should be brutally tortured and murdered and stuff like that. I also tried to bait them into telling me to kms (because I\u2019m a white man, exploiter, parasite, etc.), and despite literal years of harassment and stalking I couldn\u2019t get a single one of those Maoists to say anything harsher than \u201cRead Marx and stop using social media, dude, you are clearly unwell.\u201d\n\n>Anyway, are you doing a weird false flag thing like me? Do we need a support group?\n\n>Edit: I would always do this impulsively when I was hungry or bored or whatever and then delete the account in shame once I came to my senses. Maybe I really did find a kindred spirit.\n\nThey are right that they are engaged with compulsive behavior but fundamentally wrong about its cause. Mentail illness (being \"unwell\") is an excuse which they have to tell themselves because there is nothing exceptional about \"trolling\" as a form of ego protection. It is much easier to be objectively flawed (have ocd, be mentally ill, be hungry, be a loser with too much free time) than admit to being subjectively wrong (freely making a conscious judgement which is incorrect), easily corrected by admitting ignorance (which is also an objective issue that is taken to be subjective by the petty-bourgeoisie mode of knowledge production - that is the blockage that must be broken down) and reading *Settlers*. The whole thing that set off years of compulsive behavior was a generic liberal misunderstanding of the concept of settler-colonialism and the politics that derive from it as a personal attack, heightened by a liberal American expectation of the \"unreality\" of the internet space where everything is permitted but nothing is true (i.e. uncivil).\n\nThis person misrepresents the common response to their many attempts at trolling. No one on this subreddit, which is committed to truth, call them unwell. That is a comfortable fiction that, even in a warped way, they have forced the other to acknowledge their effort. The response is almost always \"you're really bad at this\" since no amount of trolling/irony will ever get closer to the basic distinction between truth and falsehood. It is easier psychologically to commit to playing a character for years over hundreds of accounts, most of which are deleted instantly, than admit to verbalizing something liberal on an anonymous free social media website, even though as this person admits reality insists again and again on the failure of their premise to lead to the results they anticipate. To admit that would be to admit it can be fixed and therefore you are responsible for fixing it. Also, by doing the reading, there is a common text on which truth can be oriented and therefore one can be wrong.\n\nThis person is an extreme case of general ideological symptoms of contemporary liberalism, one I am privileged to see as a mod (at least half the reactions top being banned are \"I was actually trolling and by banning me you've only played into my hand\" and after discussion it tends towards probably 75%). The other key thing here is after this moment of \"clarity\" this person is back to their compulsive behavior and failing again. As has been discussed on this subreddit before, in our age of mental illness as an object of scientific discourse (understood as the crude discourse of the master signifier, not Marxist science\n\nhttps://nosubject.com/Science\n\n>On the one hand, it attempts to monopolize truth as its exclusive property [6]; and, on the other hand, science is in fact based on a foreclosure of the concept of truth as cause)\n\nIndulging this discourse gets one no closer to the truth and, by extension, a real cure.",
