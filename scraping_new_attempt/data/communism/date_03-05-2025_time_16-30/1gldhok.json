    "selftext": "I want to focus on organizing in the community right now and obviously education is a factor in that. What do you think it wiser/generally preferred, physical media or ebooks? \n\nI\u2019m generally a huge proponent of physical media since it can\u2019t be lost in the way that digital can, but there\u2019s also that: it can\u2019t be lost in the way digital can. I feel like the acquisition/ownership of nonphysical media that could be viewed as questionable by the powers that be would be easier and smarter, since it can be torrented/downloaded from free PDFs and it can be easily disposed of.

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There can be tangible benefits to physical and digital copies and that can be separate to the \"real\" motivation someone has when making a particular choice. It's quite easy to justify picking up a physical copy to yourself because it's easier to read on public transportation but be driven by the fear that your e-reader copy will get wiped out remotely during the next Red Scare, or downloading the e-reader version because it's with something you use regularly but in actuality doing that because it is an extension of passive engagement and demands little.",

As for distribution of a book to the masses or a mass base, it would simply be a tactical consideration based on the conditions you're faced with (though really print media outside of a short pamphlet has little justification today for existing in a world where 5MB of html data costs less to share than even the shortest of books).",

That being said, there are times where the \"powers that be\" would clamp down on revolutionary media. This is just as true for online/digital media as print media, so ultimately neither are the objectively correct choice in these instances. However, we don't currently live in those circumstances, and I don't think you really need to worry about it in the moment. Developing community leadership comes first. High security all the time can obstruct just as much as it helps.",

As you've identified, there are advantages and drawbacks to both. How are these pros and cons related to the conditions you're operating in? There is no universally correct answer here. \n\nFor example: Where we (Nobody Owns Land) are at, we're primarily interacting with low-medium income working class and lumpen tenants. In this context, many people generally don't have much more than a cheap phone in terms of technology, and through practice we've found that even those who do own tablets and computers tend to be more engaged with physical media. However, most don't have the disposable income to buy new (or used) books as-needed. So we developed the capacity to format, print, and bind our own books for people at low cost, which we give away for free as-needed. For the few who genuinely prefer to read on devices, there's PDFs as well. This also allows everyone involved to have more-or-less the same document regardless of what they're reading off of, rather than having to deal with the potential confusion of different people having different editions of the same book.\n\nYour experience will almost certainly be different than ours though, so again, you're going to get much more useful answers from the people you organize than on this subreddit.",
