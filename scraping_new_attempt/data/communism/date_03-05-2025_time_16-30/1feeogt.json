Nazariya Magazine, despite occasional issues with the *quality* of its writing, is nevertheless one of the foremost serious online Marxist/Maoist journals and it saddens me to see it only ever cited/read in the context of that one article about first-world vs. third-world queerness.",

I ll read it properly later but this anvil magazine (if i remember correctly, this is a part of or somehow related to a student body called \"disha\" of the hundred flowers reading group which itself is part of another electoral party whose name i forget - the most interesting this is they are extremely secretive about their association to their parent organizations) is simply not worth paying attention to. It is opportunism at its finest. I had the misfortune of attending their reading group once or twice and almost choked when the speaker went off on a rant about the semi-feudal semi-colonial character of india and how it was made up. Their posters were also extremely misleading. It mentioned a debate on electoral participation in india but there was no debate - just a speaker going off on how electoral politics is justified and his fans defending him.",

The mode of production debates in India provide invaluable lessons for Marxists everywhere - how does one determine the mode of production in a country? and how does one derive the appropriate strategy and tactics from the investigation of the mode of production? This article is great for illustrating how different answers to the mode of production debate changes a party's strategy and tactics towards the rich peasantry. But even this particular study is important for Communists even in the imperialist countries like US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, Italy which saw international support from the Punjabi diaspora for the farmers protests. \n\n/u/theaceofshadows recently posted about the arrest of Ajay Kumar, whose work on production relations in Haryana is cited in this article.

While CLI (ML), their electoral front RWPI, and their various other fronts like this Anvil magazine may be \"annoying\" in the way they conduct themselves, but the larger question of mode of production is one of the key contestations among communists in the present and is fundamental for any anti-revisionist. After Naxalbari, India had more than two dozen communist groupings upholding the position that the mode of production is semi-colonial semi-feudal. At the present, this number has whittled down to a number you can count on one hand. Even the ones which still uphold that India is semi-colonial semi-feudal (CPI ML New Democracy, UCCRI ML, for example), display a right opportunist understanding in that they argue for emergence of capitalism in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Western Uttar Pradesh while the rest of the country remains semi-feudal. One of the most dangerous forms of revisionism, the neo-Kautsykite variant displayed by the likes of Darshan Pal, Arjun Prasad and Balraj, hinges its arguments on the same understanding. Student leader Umar Khalid and his cult argued the same (capitalism in the metropolitans, semi-feudalism in the countryside) to defend his sexual opportunism.\n\nMost neo revisionists begin their journey by first questioning semi-colonial semi-feudal nature of India and justify their existence via their reading of capitalist development in India. There's a reason communists in India are still participating in this debate. It is of great value to discuss it, not just for people internationally, but also for anyone trying to make a serious play at politics in India.",

                                                    "body": "Umar was a leader of a Marxist Leninist Maoist student union but had multiple charges of sexual harassment levied against him by members of the organization. The issues stemmed from the fact that he was engaging with multiple sexual partners, living with another woman and kept his relationships hidden from the organization, with some of his partners also unaware of others. His cult tried to keep the complaints hushed until the executive committee of the organization took cognizance of the matter. When called to discuss the charges, Khalid's group refused to engage. The EC finally kicked him out which led to his entire cult leaving with him, levying attacks against their organization, against the all-India  Revolutionary Democratic Front and against the entire revolutionary movement. Their charge was that the movement displayed \"semi-feudal patriarchy.\" The contestation is this: if the one partner consented to keeping the relationship hidden, was okay with him engaging with multiple partners, the organization had no right to criticize. So the two primary questions of ideological debate are 1) consent theory and 2) free sex theory.\n\nIn the first, both sides agreed that India is a semi-colonial semi-feudal country, they understand that consent is manufactured by various social forces. Extra-economic coercion is a key feature in semi-feudal societies and brahmanical patriarchy normalizes feudal bonds of patriarchy. Most women give consent on feudal parameters (caste, feudalism's implied right of men to women's bodies, social normalization of marital rape, etc.). Where the Khalid cult differs is that it argues that this may be true for large swathes of the Indian countryside, this is not true for petite bourgeois women in the metropolitan, where capitalist penetration is the strongest. They counter argued that condemning Umar's action amounts to a \"protectionist\" and patriarchal understanding, which stops what are essential awakened women from exercising their right to have sex however they want. This comes from the weird understanding that women do not deal with patriarchal influence on the construction of consent in advanced capitalist countries. This also introduced the second matter, that by way of engaging free sexual relations, a woman liberates herself. These positions have been countered by [Lenin himself in his discussions with Clara Zetkin.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm) The gist of the counter position is that a) just because bureaucratic capitalism introduces distorted capitalist relations in some pockets (key component of any semi-colonial semi-feudal society) does not qualitatively change the nature of brahmanical patriarchy in the cities b) the liberation of women is not found in practicing the same sexual opportunism that men are granted a pass for by patriarchy, ruling class women have done the same in all modes of production and that has contributed nothing to women's liberation and c) communists cannot think of relationships as outside of the collective and make them \"private matters\" so as to protect themselves from any social accountability for what they do in these \"private relationships\", this is nothing but bourgeois individualism.\n\nThis was a very public debate, which culminated in Umar leaving to form a separate organization, outside of any collective discipline. His degeneration into a liberal over the next few years was set in stone after this.\n\nOn a side note, I've noticed the word sexual opportunism seems to invite some confused responses here, which I am assuming is due to the fact that most western revisionist parties seem to have a liberal or post modernist understanding when it comes to questions of marriage, sexual relations and communist morality, except for the erstwhile MIM Party.",

Umar and his supporters basically used a lot of words and distorted theory to justify sleazy behaviour.\n\nThe Nazariya articles provides a useful counter to the idea that it is only the rural parts of a semi-feudal nation that contain semi-feudalism, when in fact it is inseparable from the economy in totality. Basically adding onto your point that distorted (am I right in using the word \"uneven\" here?) capitalist development doesn't qualitatively change Brahmanical patriarchy.\n\nWith regards to your final paragraph, I agree. But I was just more confused with the phrase sexual opportunism because I just hadn't heard of it. But thanks to this sub I have come across the more correct theories on sexuality, 'consent' etc.  I've dealt with many imperial core leftists and liberals who think engaging in polyamory and polygamy somehow makes you progressive, and is actually anti-capitalist. Usually they use a narrow reading of Engels' theory on family and monogamy to justify this view. I just end up thinking about feudal landlord castes in India (because I'm Indian) who have patriarchs with multiple wives.\n\nBeyond that, I can't speak too much on Umar and his cult's bs. I know it's theoretically wrong and all, but I have a long way to go in self-criticism, unlearning with how I am as a man.",
