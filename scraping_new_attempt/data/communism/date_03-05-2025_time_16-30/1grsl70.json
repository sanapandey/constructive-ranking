You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Asociating freedom of speech with democracy is just retelling you what the Bourgeois want you to believe.\n\nEvery state is authoritarian. It is the authority of the ruling class over the ruled class(es). In capitalism you have the dictatorship of the bourgeois ruling over the proletariat. The more the ruling class feels threatened by the ruled class the more the ruling class has to increase its authority over the ruled class. The only reason why we had so many \"freedoms\" like freedom of speech etc was because the ruled class is no threat to the ruling class.\n\nWe can see that more and more people become hostile towards the system because of various reasons (mostly economic reasons) and with that we can literally see how \"western democracies\" are using more and more authority to opress the ruled class.\n\nRevolution is the most authoritarian thing you can do. There is nothing more authoritarian than a class forcing another class into a new system. To destroy the old system and k\\*ll everyone counter revolutionairy.\n\nAfter the revolution the old ruling class obviously is not powerless. They want to restore the old world and still have influence over many people, maybe still have big capital and their ideology is still wide spread. The bourgeois is dangerous to the proletarian state as long as they exist and especially in the first years after revolution.\n\nWhat did we just learn about dealing with a ruled class that is dangerous for the ruling clas? You have to opress them. You need authority. But this also means that you cant let bourgeois ideology be expressed or printed.\n\nJust like currently our system is a democracy for the bourgeois the new system will be a democracy for the proletariat. But the bourgeois have to be excluded from that. They cant be allowed to taint the new found power of the proletariat. They can not be allowed to sabotage the socialist state and system. They have to be stripped of their private property. I dont care how violent they might resist. They have to be stripped of their right to express their opinion freely. They have to be stripped from their right of participation basically until they are submerged into the proletariat. And if they dont want to-Forced proletarianization (G\\*lag)",
