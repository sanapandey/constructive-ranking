    "selftext": "I was longing about making  a post about this struggle because I think talking about parties and universities especially in a urban context is probably something that most people here are already familiar or a subject that has been extensively covered. But I feel like there's really no other place that I feel like someone will give a valuable advice or criticism as here in my town in Brazil, any criticism is generally poor received in favor of the revisionist shilling that most people that know UP/PCB have probably struggled against.\n\nWell, first things first, I come around this sub for about a year now and I was genuinely impressed by the quality of posts. Certainly a lot of comrades here put in a lot of work and effort for the development of marxism and, whether reddit obviously will never replace the core of the proletariat scientifical knowledge, there's obviously a ton of experience and insights that I have seen here that helped me a lot since I \"randomly\" arrived here and more important, that helped a substantial amount of young, unexperienced and unaware people that, although struggle against electoralist parties revisionism, are completely unarmed in the struggle. Most people are compelled to voting, whether is voting on the president, the city council or the university student's body, elections take a significant amount of time and energy of the already organized youth.\n\nI don't think I will need to explain in detail why this practice eventually drains out energy and is far from being any revolutionary work. u/smokeuptheweed9  already covered some of the practices that are the usual among revisionist parties in universities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/zwygyl/the_american_left_and_the_uc_strike/). The setting is not that different as far as PCB, UP, PSOL, PCdoB repeat a lot of the trash that Smoke already covered and I think it would be repetitive to just go over in detail, I really dont think it's that interesting, the only thing that might be worth mentioning is that since the place that I study is relatively small compared to other bigger universities, only UP (Correnteza) and PCBrasileiro (UJC) have organized students here.  There's also PSOL (Juntos) youth but there's only a single one of them here. I was reading [MEPR's thesis](https://meprbrasil.com.br/teses/) a few days ago and whether I think this give a decent overview in the student struggle, in some capacity I think it's a little bit outdated as it does not cover the post pandemic conjecture, as it does not follow the devastation caused by the Dilma, Temer, Bolsonaro and Lula reforms and also does not develop anything about settlerism. I don't know whether I 'overrate'  brazilian settlerism but as far as it goes in my experience and reading, Federal Universities in Brazil are notoriously packed with white-chauvinism and whether people dont like to talk about or admit it, status quo mantain itself through white supremacy. Where I study, after Lula's election, university administrative staff was \"won\" by the \"leftist/progressive\" professors and administrative staff, there was also a significant campaining for the \"progressive\" candidature made by Correnteza and also supported by UJC. This is not that important but is noticeable how the label as \"leftist\" or \"progressive\" is a trick card for social-fascists to pull whenever they have their asses against the wall and are unable to compromise themselves with the students demands. It is also common that this label of \"progressive\" become a trick card for defense everytime a reputation is in danger because some professor was racist or transphobic, administration was also successful as they were able to create a bridge between them and the revisionist Correnteza/UJC orgs and are quickly to intervene and supress the many struggles in which students are victims of abuse and violence. The situation is so absurd that even that racist abuse/offence being a federal crime in brazilian constitution for quite a few decades, last week the administration launched a \"racism protocol\" as measure for fighting racism after a number of incidents through the semester. It's difficult to go in more detail because local UJC and Correnteza are so trash that they do not produce any criticism or any document regarding any struggle so as I said, I think that I cannot add anything more significant than what is already in MEPR thesis and also in smoke's post. Also, I feel like in some capacity whether I was unaware of MEPR documents until very recently (I shared the thesis with a friend and he asked \"it was you that wrote this?\"), I dare to say that opportunism just reconfigure itself as the same regardless of organization since opportunism is a phenomena attached to monopoly. I read their thesis and not only it did look like \"I was the one that wrote it\" but it revealed the following: since I dedicated time to studying marxism, I was able to grasp a lot that MEPR suggests way before I knew about their existance. No org or individual is immune from opportunism, revisionism, shallow dogmatism and other trends, the only way to minimize it's potential is to keep studying the revolutionary theory and to keep in touch with the masses.\n\nI think that what is motivating me to write this, is that, although is easy to see why every single one of the brazilian \"communist\" (at least the ones that are recognized by TSE, I'm not very familiar with P.C.B-FV and is not that clear if they have connections with MEPR outside of A Nova Democracia and Servir ao Povo) parties are revisionist and counterrevolucionaries (this is actually so easy to see that it has become common sense among the masses where I study), struggling against it, it's obviously way more difficult to gather people around and forge an opposition. There's where lies the importance of theoretical development, something that I would like to thank u/turbovacuumcleaner for the advice that it was given to me [earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1b52vm6/comment/ktaj7u7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), whether this sub is not the place for personal praise, it was that approach that motivated me to read some of the classical works of marxism and helped not only me, but led me into helping dozens and hopefully hundreds of people into being introduced to the science of marxism. As I said, it's never easy and the more you study, the more difficult you grasp that it is, but that's what's actually refreshing. I think that by realizing how distant you actually are, you can actually see a revolution on the horizon, whether by reducing every single action to an electoralist practice, failure is immediate. As smoke wisely said, opportunism can only lead to fail, today and tomorrow.\n\nAs this post is already extensive, I will conclude here. I hope I can provide some more depthful class analysis in other moment about the university that I'm studying but that would require some data and work to do than what I can provide by now. As for PCB/UP, in my experience, stay away from those parties, they are just as useless and as attached to brazilian social-democracy as PT/PCdoB/PSOL already are, they are just even more irrelevant. As for MEPR, I wasnt able to contact the org or any of their members yet, but in the meantime I think that their thesis is going to be quite helpful in keeping it \"simple\" but giving valuable context to people that were not introduced to revolutionary marxism and student struggle yet. Most people, just like me, were only able to be in contact with the revisionist electoralist orgs that I have already mentioned.",

That said, your post reads more like a lengthy rant against reformist movements among university students rather than an analysis of Brazilian revisionism. Simply labeling everything as \"trash\" doesn't really move the discussion forward.\n\nAs it stands, we don't have a communist party in Brazil. This isn't surprising\u2014there's no revolution on the horizon, and many seem content with their newfound \"communist\" identities.\n\nI'm skeptical about AND/P.C.B (FV) in their current form. A correct line will only emerge when the revolution is truly on the horizon. Until then, the advice remains the same: as you yourself pointed out, \"without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement.\" So, keep studying.",

                    "body": "I think that I might have rushed to post and omited some info that might be interesting. It was also wrong to entitle the post as \"Brazilian revisionism\" as I was talking about a specific scenario, that is misleading.\n\nAs I jumped to label orgs as trash without providing more detail, I probably failed to explain in better terms why. Not that it changes much because it was already mistaken, but I meant that after having contact with those parties for nearly a decade by now, the experience never went really beyond vague and superficial opportunism so these orgs are not really well recomended for spending time and energy. This might as well be self-criticism as being myself inside the struggle, vague and superficial opportunism is certainly something that I have done through the years as well.\n\nAmong the things that I think that might be worth mentioned:\n\n1) I was reading Fanon's Wretched of the Earth and in my evaluation, both UJC and Correnteza fail to organize the struggle of the oppressed and join, whether their militants are aware or not, the side of the oppressor. Both of the orgs, at the first sight of any confrontation, as little as intervening in classes to call out reactionary professors, openly demobilize the students to not take any \"violent\" action against the oppressor, even if that \"violence\" means just interrupting with noise. I think this type of practice is conscious, even if the militance is not aware of it, because just as Fanon described (sorry, didnt find it in english). At least for me, this gave more depth to what turbovacuumcleaner have suggested that time.\n\n\"Os partidos pol\u00edticos nacionalistas n\u00e3o insistem nunca na necessidade da prova de for\u00e7a, porque o seu objectivo n\u00e3o \u00e9 exactamente a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o radical do sistema. Pacifistas, legalistas, partid\u00e1rios da ordem... nova, essas forma\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edticas colocam cruamente \u00e0 burguesia colonialista o problema que lhes parece essencial: \u00abD\u00eaem-nos mais poder.\u00bb Sobre o problema espec\u00edfico da viol\u00eancia, as elites s\u00e3o amb\u00edguas. S\u00e3o violentas nas palavras e reformistas nas atitudes.\"\n\n2) As consequence of the opportunistic trend being hegemonic among students, spontaneism eventually appears and some students put emphasis into cheap vandalism as \"revolutionary\" action. This is something that both Correnteza/UJC have done a good job containing and isolating it's advocates.\n\n3) This I think is probably well known, but most of those orgs militants instead of doing research and study are designated to spend a lot of their times into tasks such as selling newspaper. It's quite common that although they might talk to a number of people, conversation rarely have any substance, they put emphasis in to struggles that most students will likely not care. Students (at least the proletariat) are busy conciliating job/internship, family, friends and college. That's what take most (likely all) of their time and struggle and where organized militance seems to ignore in favor of talking about struggles in sites that nobody has ever been at.\n\n4) And I think that might be a consequence from the third, most students dont take these orgs seriously. I may have been too quick to call them trash here in this sub, but honestly, I have questioned a bunch of people about their relation with those parties, and most just dismiss them as not helping at all with anything, specially those that are currently working and do not depend on completing graduation. A lot of people dont care about those orgs at all and many mock and laugh at them as \"apartment leninists\"\n\n5) According to MEPR thesis, it does seems like what I'm describing has been the norm for the past 20 years or so. Whether disputes between the \"smaller\" parties of Social-Democracy and PCdoB for UNE's control have taken most of the years, the consequences seems to be catching up. Stalin's contribution against Kautsky is what comes up to my mind:\n\n\"Kautsky disse que os partidos da II Internacional s\u00e3o instrumentos de paz e n\u00e3o de guerra, que justamente por isso n\u00e3o estavam em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de empreender alguma coisa de s\u00e9rio, durante a guerra, no per\u00edodo das a\u00e7\u00f5es revolucion\u00e1rias do proletariado. Isto \u00e9 verdade. Mas, que significa isto? Significa que os partidos da II Internacional n\u00e3o servem para a luta do proletariado, que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o partidos de luta do proletariado, que possam conduzir os oper\u00e1rios \u00e0 conquista do Poder, mas um aparelho eleitoral, adaptado \u00e0s elei\u00e7\u00f5es parlamentares e \u00e0 luta parlamentar.\"\n\nI dont know if it's mistaken from me to consider those as similarities, but whenever you replace the 2nd International with \"Redemocratiza\u00e7\u00e3o\", the description have similarities for the situation I observe.\n\n6) This is also covered in MEPR Thesis as well, the opportunistic hegemony is often calling for \"unity\" among the students whenever the students start to gather in numbers against the parties. MEPR refers to PCdoB but in my experience, Correnteza members are the ones who actually call for unity as desperation. This is laughable and honestly sounds disrespectful. Once you learn about the existence of brazilian settlerism, the mere suggestion regarding \"unity\" is a spit on the oppressed history. Brazil was created to be a white supremacist country and one of the most divided societies that ever existed, I can be wrong here but as marxists, our duty is to investigate what does actually creates division (which is poorly understood)\n\n7) Is a common habit in local Correnteza to appeal to humiliation and labels trying to suffocate opposition as \"anarchists\" or even as \"madman\" whenever their line is challenged. That happens with internal opposition as well. As I've read in a letter available at Banned Thought, it does seems like institutional violence is used by party cadres to mantain their power whenever they're challenged. I have 2 colleagues that have been expelled from Correnteza in  2024, one being a very respected and experienced cadre, that started to challenge the electoralist strategies internally. The other one was a newcomer dismissed after a number of disputes that happened in universities strike earlier in the year and the entire militance was ordered to not engage in to any conversation with any of them.\n\nBeing honest, at best I think that I'll not necessarily bringing anything new for discussion because as MEPR suggests, it seems like this have been happening since 2003. What happens is that myself and others might be merely experiencing a reconfiguration of opportunism in a place that is already well known for opportunism",

There's no focus on studying Marxism seriously. You're left with a group of petty-bourgeois students who've barely touched Lenin and whose only exposure to Marx is The Communist Manifesto. The inevitable result is opportunism.\n\n>Once you learn about the existence of brazilian settlerism, the mere suggestion regarding \"unity\" is a spit on the oppressed history.

This is part of my criticism of AND/P.C.B (FV) as well. Now, imagine organizations primarily made up of white petty-bourgeois students who don't even engage seriously with theory, it's to be expected that confronting them feels like arguing against liberal ideology. I think this stems from the fact that only Maoists attempt to analyze race as class, but the only Maoist org we have completely fails to do so. As a result, we're left without any real analysis of the influence of settlerism in Brazil.\n\n\nIn the end, we're left with orgs that only care about your free labor. When you fail to meet their expectations, you're excluded. I've seen many comrades who were serious and full of potential end up burning out, and when they took time off, they felt completely alienated from the party.",

I wasn't really aware of their existance until somewhat recently and the only way that I found to have contact was through the internet. I wasn't familiar with the split and thanks for sharing both links by the way. I've read them both and investigated some publications on their website and was able to find some differences from where I do study.\n\nHere, Pedagogy and Social Science have recently organized the CAs and most of the stuff in the curriculum is heavily anti-marxist (since I'm a Social Science student, dealing with anti-marxism from colleagues in Extension Projects and having to expel every liberal from the CA took quite some of my time this year - in which I have to admit that sadly led to a lot of pettiness - but also to a lot of benefits) and seems by the pictures that in UERJ for example is different from here. Social Science is way more conservative and so does Pedagogy, I'm mentioning both undergrads because not only I'm a undergrad in one of them but I also became close with people in Pedagogy and both CAs are currently reorganizing themselves and seems like it exist a different internal dynamic with reactionary thought being hegemonic that is not as well comprehended among students.\n\nI have read N-MEPR evaluation on [UFF elections](https://novomepr.com.br/balanco-das-eleicoes-para-dce-2024-a-quem-interessa-uma-eleicao-desmobilizada/) and was able to spot some differences but also identical situations. In UNIRIO similar stuff happened during the year: there was a strike, there was a student mobilization for the strike, there was manifestations against reactionary professors that maintained classes during the strike (that Correnteza openly opposed against the \"independent\" line) which led the Administration to put the entire movement on the verge of being considered illegal as manifestations were deemed \"too violent\" (I swear this is an absurd and even comical, things never left the stage where people just loudly intervene until the class is cancelled), but unfortunately, due to the lack of a proper org and the fact that both the soc-dem orgs that I've mentioned as the major forces are well established, the \"independent\" force eventually dipped. The strike is important because I was able to investigate with some militants and in UNIRIO, PSTU and UJS just abandoned the student central organization (DCE) within the last 10 years (I will investigate if I find any documents on this but I don't know if this is likely to even exist) and Correnteza/UJC took DCE eventually in the post-pandemic. At the time there was the speech on defeating the \"majoritary\" UJS and denouncing poor conduction of the Student Movement but that did not sustained, Correnteza became too attached to the socdem administration and left any revolutionary discourse or action left in their primary intetions. At the strike, it was the \"first\" time that students from different undergrads were able to have proper contact about life and work and have a better understanding of political conscience as the situation forced everyone to. I don't think I have much else to say about the strike because what I may have to say, you will find in Lenin about the principles of proletarian conscience in his [own words](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1899/dec/strikes.htm).",

I know this is a really late reply, and I apologize for this, but I feel I owe you a proper answer. Truth be told, I began writing this back when you made this post, but I could not finish it. From being busy with work, down to personal issues and the general difficulty that is writing, and I have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to write about my own experiences, since I haven\u2019t been a student for some time. Even now, I look at this text and feel it doesn\u2019t flow as much as I would like. If the reading is not pleasant, or confused, the fault lies with myself for not being able to write as good as I should. \n\n> That's something that I have to say that locally I'm currently doing somewhat of alone but by doing so it attracted many students back to marxism when it generally happens the opposite, at least in my experience, dealing with socdems and opportunists more often leads to joining a socdem party and rejection to marxism than attracts people to stay struggling for communism.\n\nThere are some similarities and differences in my case. I witnessed a period that student activism reached its peak, its crisis and following demise, only to be reconstituted as it was before. At the time, college organizations were divided between the standard revisionist and/or social-democratic orgs you talked about, like Correnteza, UJR, UJC, UJS, JPT; Trotskyists and scattered Anarchist collectives. At some point, during one DCE election, most orgs tried to fraud it with tactics similar to what you and N-MEPR described, from intimidation and harassment down to restricting access to ballot boxes. Needless to say, the election was not recognized, be it by the university, professors, administrative staff or the students as a whole. The blatant fraud caused the suspension of DCE elections, and all the orgs that partook in the farce came out of it severely demoralized, and collapsed not too long after. On the left, only Trotskyists and Anarchists remained, the former for not engaging in the farce, while the latter rejecting taking part in elections out of principle. The absence and demoralization of Marxism caused by these orgs paved the way for the rise of openly reactionary organizations, from imperialist, NGO fronts down to Catholic and Evangelic fascist youths. For people like myself, there was an ambiguous process that we didn\u2019t really have control of, the real development of the situation pushed us to Marxism, but at the same time Marxism was constantly under a crisis it had created by itself. Of course, these orgs I mentioned were not Communists, but in my own and others\u2019 lack of a better understanding, it seemed like revisionism and Marxism were one and the same. As such, we were drawn and repelled of Marxism, so, theoretical development was slow, contradictory, and unconscious of itself. It took people like me years to read basic books and to start to seriously engage with theory, as reality more often than not immediately drew our attention to more pressing issues.\n\nAlthough there was struggle between the remaining orgs like the Trots, Anarchists and different shades of reactionaries and fascists, they had some things in common, notably a vulgar anti-Communism that served as basis for all their politics. I\u2019m talking of things like \u201cStalin killed millions\u201d sort of bullshit. And this proved to be their weakest point, for this absence of Communist orgs roughly coincided with the earliest developments of Dengism, and popularization of its authors like Martens, Losurdo and Furr. The reactionaries\u2019 anti-Communism was so vulgar that we were wrongly under the impression that, having found a proper set of ready-made answers against their lies was more than enough to resist their attacks. So, Dengist revisionism at first developed out of necessity, and seemingly fulfilled a progressive role. To us, merely understanding how propaganda was fabricated against Stalin or Mao was enough to establish a clear line between revisionist, reactionaries and true Marxist-Leninists. I\u2019m ashamed in admitting this, but I\u2019m one of the earliest adopters of Dengism, and directly took part in its popularization. By the time I finished university, the now commonplace opinions of Dengism were starting to become more popular, at least on campus, but they were far from mainstream. Today, almost all of the organizations that collapsed came back, having assimilated Dengism into their own lines, making them able to withstand the most blatant forms of fascism and revisionism, but not being able to rise beyond this level. Liberalism collapsed, only to be rebirth, more complete than before.\n\nI like N-MEPR\u2019s assessment of the UFF elections due to its lack of pretentiousness that plagues the writing of their parent organization, but at the same time, I have a lingering feeling that perhaps not much has been learned from experience. Its really weird reading words and slogans that belonged to a different time still being used today, like REItoria, independente, combativo, etc.. These were ideas, more or less spontaneously developed during REUNI years, and that are liberal: combativo is another word for spontaneism, and the way that is used shows the lack of a proper understanding of how the Bolsheviks\u2019 fighting spirit came from fierce struggle, rejecting compromises with opportunism; independente is closer to Anarchism than Communism (on a deeper thought, if there is a party behind a student org, and said party is revolutionary, then it is imperative to tie student struggle with the broader class struggle of the country, instead of calling for abstract independence that can only undermine proletarian leadership among students), and REItoria, referring to undemocratic transformations of universities in the 2000s, that required further centralization and verticalization, while at the same time conflicting with the horizontalization and broadening of the university as an ideological institution. I believe N-MEPR\u2019s lack of consciousness surrounding these subjects comes from a wrong assessment they simply borrowed from MEPR, treating it as metaphysical without ever being able to question its roots. I\u2019m talking about the [legacy of 2013]( https://novomepr.com.br/porque-rompemos-com-a-coordenacao-nacional-do-mepr/), which they claim as a major positive inheritance. \n\nThe early 2010s were surreal. I have difficulty relating to some of your experiences because they are not quite the same, and don\u2019t follow the same path. Higher education was going through deep changes through REUNI, Prouni and affirmative actions; there was a general optimism, backed by unimaginable rates of growth by today\u2019s standards, accompanied by a similar rise in wages (represented in Dilma\u2019s speeches of a country that was now predominantly middle class); the hosting of international events; the overseas presence of national companies; the euphoria of anti-IMF speeches by Lula; establishment of a national project centered around Petrobras for further development; a clear line separating supporters of US imperialism and national capital, and so on. At the same time, this general optimism coexisted with profound contradictions that were increasingly more acute: rising living costs, inflation, increasingly more police repression against black and indigenous masses, imperialist pressure and sabotage, with all this exploding in several sorts of spontaneous activities like strikes, occupations and protests. \n\nThere\u2019s a predominant misconception today about June of 2013. On the one hand, revisionists and pro-PT social-democrats pretend it came of out nowhere, like a lightning breaking the night for a split second, only to disappear immediately, paving the way for the modern common sense of the protests as a fascist, US psyop. These are the people that believe the protests were a Color Revolution *\u00e0 la* Maidan. Others mystify it as the largest mass movement since the democratic struggles of the 80s, and see its movement inherently as progressive from breaking up with liberal inertia that followed PT\u2019s rise. It was progressive because the masses moved, and didn\u2019t really mattered where. Both of them are profoundly anti-people, one from the right and the other from the left, for both of them assume the masses are, deep down, stupid. More than that, June gets separated from the whole years of rising contradictions that preceded it, like the huge strikes of 2012 and 2011. For example, I vividly remember while going to class passing by some construction sites that had gatherings almost everyday. As such, for the rightists in this view, June can be separated of what preceded it, and to rightfully rebel can be thus distorted as leading to fascism. To the ones with the left view, June is nothing but the natural culmination of years of effort.",

This was documented here, on this subreddit, in this old [post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gremb/brazils_protests_have_become_fascist/), as well in this [old documentary]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnIBgT4eBKc) (the timestamp is 32:40 to 33:50):\n\n> Elena Judensnaider: I was very sad on Monday. I was surprised with the amount of people on the streets, right? And, at first, when I arrived, I thought all of that was very positive, but I left the manifestation concerned. What I saw was an astonishing emptying of mottos [pauta, doesn\u2019t have proper English translation, can also be interpreted as agenda]. I almost didn\u2019t heard the street cries related to transportation\n\n> Bruno Torturra: But on that day, when I saw a bunch of people arriving with Brazilian flags, and the organized groups handing out Brazilian flags. Anarchists, black blocs, PSOL, PT here and there, I said \u201cWow, there are a lot of people here that hate each other, and they are together\u201d. And during the manifestation, I thought that was beautiful, but when I got back home, I saw a lot of people posting online concerned, saying things like \u201cGet out of the streets\u201d, \u201cThere are rightists trying to coopt\u201d, \u201cI didn\u2019t like what I saw\u201d, \u201cIt lost focus\u201d, but I came back home feeling quite down.\n\nContrary to N-MEPR, and MEPR as well, June of 2013 isn\u2019t a moment of two unite into one, but of one divides into two. The longstanding unity built by PT, of coalescence between all classes represented in social-democratic liberalism following the demise of FHC and PSDB reached its critical point, the quantitative changes reached a qualitative leap, and as such, unity was no longer possible. All classes were now on the streets, be it dragging or being dragged, and the task for a proper Communist party was not parading movement by movement\u2019s sake, like what these two organizations make, but of inquiring what classes were present, why, and what are the most advanced sections of the masses to build upon them, and to isolate the most backward ones. The total absence of this line of thought is proof that not only the protests are mystified, but that there is a really poor grasp of historical materialism. We live in a post-2013 era, but there are way too few attempts at explaining how and what transitioned since then. So, when confronted with Temer and Bolsonaro, the rampant rise of fascism seems like a point off the curve. The transition of the past decade does not make sense. Until we go back to the years that preceded 2013.\n\nI omitted this in the beginning on purpose while mentioning the fallout of the frauded elections. Beyond the unity among all remaining orgs being a vulgar anti-Marxism, there was another one that encompassed all of them, with the exception of Anarchists and, at some points, Trotskyists: how to keep the black and indigenous masses out of universities. Affirmative actions reached their peak during this time, and these fascists were consistently white supremacists that opposed them; they did not have the strength to revert this policy on a national level, so, they became staunch supporters of austerity and neoliberalism to fulfill the same goal. The form of the affirmative actions was maintained, but its content emptied, as now there are not enough scholarships for keeping these black and indigenous students inside universities, thus, the petty bourgeois ranks remained restricted mostly to the white petty bourgeoisie. Furthermore, PT had promoted for years the *campe\u00e3s nacionais* policy, supporting national monopoly capital. The white petty bourgeoisie, faced by competition from all sides, defected to imperialism so as to save itself: national monopoly capital must be destroyed \u2014 Operation Car Wash, Weak Meat, destruction of heavy industry, dismantling of BNDES, ceasing of export of capital (only to be reconstituted in the last few years), all under the name of fighting corruption, i.e. the cry for a reactionary program of turning back the wheel of history and restoring free competition capitalism, except corruption is an immanent characteristic of monopoly capital and its relationship to the state \u2014 and black and indigenous people must be kept out of the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie: support of austerity, religious persecution, further militarization of the state and of the white masses, creation of white supremacist militias, dismantling of the Disarmament Law, i.e. further reinforcing the semi-colonial condition of the black and indigenous nations. The white petty bourgeoisie went from the basis of PT to its self-declared enemy. \n\nWe were faced by specific contradictions: how to fight PT\u2019s black and indigenous genocide at home and abroad, while at the same time being faced with its Bundist programs for expanding bourgeois education; how to resist US imperialism \u2014 there was a general fear at the time of PSDB coming back after the Jos\u00e9 Serra-Chevron [leaks]( https://wikileaks.org/Nos-bastidores-o-lobby-pelo-pre.html)  \u2014 when simultaneously Brazil itself was seemingly becoming the same \u2014 [headlines](https://diplomatique.org.br/edicao/edicao-19/) about \u201cBrazilian imperialism\u201d like this were not uncommon. There were classrooms filled with exchange students from Angola, Mozambique and Haiti, and they were the ones that highlighted [how Brazilians weren\u2019t that different from Americans or Europeans under some circumstances]( https://bricspolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Chinese-and-Brazilian-Private-firms-in-Sub-Saharan-Afica.pdf), and I witnessed chauvinist arguments where some of our Communists tried to deny this: \u201cNo, you see, we are Third World too. Our presence in your countries is determined by the US!\u201d.",

The ones that have consistently upheld the line PT is comprador are Trotskyists and Maoists (and funnily enough, this was also the position of Trotsky himself regarding Tsarist Russia, a far cry from Lenin and Stalin that said Russia is a reserve of imperialism and called for its defeat); and while they had a point in 2002 after Lula\u2019s letter stating they would continue FHC\u2019s policies, this point fails to maintain itself up until 2014, when Brazil was one of the leading countries in the Pink Tide, and despite the mild accommodation between PT and neoliberalism, the period was marked by clashes; and this is what explains why the party and Lula remain an ever-present force until today, and why they had and still have wide support. I have not seen convincing arguments, be it from Trotskyists or Maoists as why that is the case, so my experiences with both of them always end up in some senseless, moralistic drivel about Lula himself, how he is cunning, sly, how the party rigs elections at unions (but never even dare to make a class analysis of said unions, the masses are always too stupid to realize how PT leadership is mischievous), etc.. They unconsciously see Lula as a Bonapartist, and while they are not entirely wrong *per se*, this has far deeper implications that are never delved into. For one, both Engels and Marx state that Bonapartism can only exist if feudalism has been destroyed; for Trotskyists this is no big deal, since they reject semi-feudalism by default; but for Maoists, this is a major contradiction that they can\u2019t get rid of, for it leads to an absurd: Brazil is not closer to Mao's China, but to Lenin's Russia. So, instead of a proper analysis of what form Bonapartism is taking today, this idea hinges on liberal common sense. Thus, Lula\u2019s own individual actions end up becoming individual explanations for politics; PT and Lula, as well as Bolsonaro being another tinpot Bonapartist, are separated from their classes, and thus we act shocked, confused or disgusted to what seems like a blind president walking inside a maze, exceptions to an abstract rule, when, in fact, this exception is the rule for said phenomenon:\n\n> As the executive authority which has made itself independent, Bonaparte feels it to be his task to safeguard \u201cbourgeois order.\u201d But the strength of this bourgeois order lies in the middle class. He poses, therefore, as the representative of the middle class and issues decrees in this sense. Nevertheless, he is somebody solely because he has broken the power of that middle class, and keeps on breaking it daily. He poses, therefore, as the opponent of the political and literary power of the middle class. But by protecting its material power he revives its political power. Thus the cause must be kept alive, but the effect, where it manifests itself, must be done away with. But this cannot happen without small confusions of cause and effect, since in their interaction both lose their distinguishing marks. New decrees obliterate the border line. Bonaparte knows how to pose at the same time as the representative of the peasants and of the people in general, as a man who wants to make the lower classes happy within the framework of bourgeois society.[...] This contradictory task of the man explains the contradictions of his government, the confused groping which tries now to win, now to humiliate, first one class and then another, and uniformly arrays all of them against him [\u2026] Industry and commerce, hence the business affairs of the middle class, are to prosper in hothouse fashion under the strong government: the grant of innumerable railroad concessions. But the Bonapartist lumpen proletariat is to enrich itself: those in the know play tripotage [underhand dealings] on the Exchange with the railroad concessions. But no capital is forthcoming for the railroads: obligation of the Bank to make advances on railroad shares. But at the same time the Bank is to be exploited for personal gain and therefore must be cajoled: release the Bank from the obligation to publish its report weekly; leonine [from Aesop\u2019s fable about the lion who made a contract in which one partner got all the profits and the other all the disadvantages] agreement of the Bank with the government. The people are to be given employment: initiation of public works. But the public works increase the people\u2019s tax obligations: hence reduction of taxes by an attack on the rentiers, by conversion of the 5-percent bonds into 4\u00bd-percent. But the middle class must again receive a sweetening: hence a doubling of the wine tax for the people, who buy wine retail, and a halving of the wine tax for the middle class, which drinks it wholesale; dissolution of the actual workers\u2019 associations, but promises of miraculous future associations. The peasants are to be helped: mortgage banks which hasten their indebtedness and accelerate the concentration of property. But these banks are to be used to make money out of the confiscated estates of the House of Orleans; no capitalist wants to agree to this condition, which is not in the decree, and the mortgage bank remains a mere decree, etc., etc. Bonaparte would like to appear as the patriarchal benefactor of all classes. But he cannot give to one without taking from another.\n\n\nWhat I see Dengism is doing is taking up what\u2019s left of PT, the white petty bourgeoisie and national monopolies\u2019 chauvinism so as to act as its own vanguard. It is a similar situation to the France of Marx\u2019s time, if the industrial capitalists fail to live up to their own historical tasks (except there was no more task to be had in the 2010s, imperialism can only be the strengthening of reaction), they end up being taken by the (in our case, white) petty bourgeoisie. The failure to navigate these contradictions is what led us to never being able to properly think about what was happening, rather, we were dragged by reality to react as quickly as possible, hence, never rising above liberalism, but collapsing into it without ever being aware.",

There's just no difference. That's actually I was trying to find out when I posted and I might not have been able to proper say when u/dovhthered correctly suggested me to be more specific. I think that being more specific and now reading the words of a proper org it also helps to clarify that I think what I'm describing is not necessarily an isolated incident but may as well be a recurrence within the movement, which was what I was trying to identify if I could find anything important.

That's something that I have to say that locally I'm currently doing somewhat of alone but by doing so it attracted many students back to marxism when it generally happens the opposite, at least in my experience, dealing with socdems and opportunists more often leads to joining a socdem party and rejection to marxism than attracts people to stay struggling for communism.",

UJC decided to not participate and only decided to put their militance to the dispute of chairs within the University Council for both chapas as well. I will lack more detail into this but I was informed that ocurred threats on national level against Juntos because of this dispute. In the end, Correnteza ended up winning as they de facto are the most organized political force in UNIRIO but they were almost defeated in an election by a rather way more dysfunctional alliance that is not a party and was made rather in a spontaneous manner than in an organized way with people that barely had any experience with organized parties. I think this might show (in limited capacity, maybe, but N-MEPR themselves admit although the situation has those slight differences) the fragility of social democracy and how quickly things can develop for communists when you struggle for the correct principles and is able to properly connect with the masses.

Most people are really not that interested in what they do and, time given, do not take them seriously. But I think that we all eventually reach a point where we all know how little we can do, inside or outside those parties, so only by reading the classics you know when to engage or when not to engage.",

In the [two biggest cities](https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/eleicoes/2024/noticia/2024/10/06/rio-abstencao-nas-eleicoes-2024.ghtml) in the country it manifested an immense amount of abstentions (while here for some reason UP is celebrating their amplified electoral campaign as the growth of socialism and the result of revolutionary work) and [abstentions are rising every single election](https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2024/noticia/2024/10/28/eleicao-2024-abstencao.ghtml). \n\nSo it does seem like afterall, UP can barely have a honest grasp into what data tells them. Keep lying to young people, fortunately for all of us, you are not going anywhere.",

We do run for elections, but the goal of that is mostly to organize and present ourselves to a larger public. The first thing I was told since the second I joined was: We cannot depend of the democracy of the bourgeoisie. The actual electoral results do not matter. What does matter is using it to get to more people. It\u2019s why we sell the journals and it\u2019s why we have an electoral front. This is also why the party is comprised of the smaller militant groups that are not legal political parties, the PCR and UJR do the work outside the legal boundaries.\n\nLike, I\u2019m sorry but in practice this is simply not what the organization is. You say we are trying to just use revisionism and work within the system while literally almost every reunion is about how we cannot compromise and that revolutionary action is the only cohesive path. You compare us to PSOL and PT and UJS while I\u2019ve seen it first hand how those cowards handle political matters, how in any assembly they\u2019ll try to fight for the least aggressive and least \u201cbothersome\u201d way to \u201cfight\u201d, and how every latest act in my state has only been even slightly successful because of our work. \n\nYou do not see our work because we do not have any money, because our work is not fucking televised. You say you do not want revisionism and shilling and that if we were doing actual work people would know. But how the hell would you if the only thing that gets to the news is right winger bullshit? No revolutionary work is going to be televised or will be described on the news. This is partially why we sell A Verdade, it\u2019s the news that won\u2019t appear on the Bourgeois media, through our brigades we talk to the people and explain actual Marxist values and tell about all the people fighting even if it seems by the mainstream news that it\u2019s hopeless.\n\nAgain, you simply do not know what we actually do. Us engaging in elections is literally 1% of what we do. We have never even been in an electoral position how would that be our focus? If you think that\u2019s all we do then you\u2019re simply exposing yourself as someone who does not know the organization, and acting like you \u201cwould know\u201d of revolutionary groundwork while that type of action is very purposefully hidden from the masses, and we have a policy of giving out news mostly on paper out of fear of future censorship, just shows you\u2019re not actually aware how these sort of actions are organized or operated.\n\n\n\nAt the very least, I\u2019d recommend actually going to a socialist assembly organized by UP or UJR and actually bringing up these concerns. Even if you don\u2019t buy it, I can guarantee you\u2019ll at least get better arguments by at least knowing what you\u2019re talking about. Do not get your information on the actions of leftist organizations through the internet lmao.",

After spending several days and hours in the year studying and frequently participating in assemblies with members of the said party, one of the revisionists of the useless org comes on Reddit to tell me that I should do exactly what I already did and will continue to do so because there's no other way. Let me ask you, do they make you believe in this crap or rather you believe in to all this crap yourself alone? In both cases, you are a useless person. In both cases, I will have to keep struggling against other revisionists in your org as I do everyday of my life. There's no other way.\n\nI'm \"bringing concerns\" to UP/UJR for years now, but most people just like you are [busy defending the party engagement with social democracy](https://internautavermelho.medium.com/up-nova-sigla-velho-oportunismo-19efd9d45b79) as it's stated to be as such nationwide. And most of them are useless revisionists just like you, who try to keep every criticism suffocated and dealt with \"internally\" where the party exerces the little control it has - since in fact, your party is not a revolutionary one, but rather a irrelevant party for the \"left\" in social-democracy - so criticism never even make it to the masses. No one is afraid of you and outside of your own bubble of \"revolutionaires\", people look at you with disgust and disrespect.",

Yet we have to see a single line of theory coming from you. I checked your recent posts, there's also not a single line of marxist thought to be found in any of them. There's in fact, a ton of posts on Elder Scrolls. Hopefully you can provide us an in-game criticism of the functioning economy, you can use marxism for that.

If you want to go in to any other direction it seems like you will be on denialism against Lenin himself, but that wouldn't surprise me. This whole tantrum of yours has been motivated by the fact that I was touching an honest criticism, that the \"socialist\" parties in Brazil are just minor parties for social democracy. That been said, that obviously is not the movement as whole. Of course there are plenty of communists in those parties still who, like you, are not even aware that this is happening. What we are trying to offer here - and you won't find this honest criticism that easily - is exactly that. That those orgs prey on people that have the actual time, diligence and the will to act in a time that not many are even interested in hearing about another failing socialist party.

As a militant, I asked myself for a long time whether the path I was \u201centering\u201d would actually be effective for my development as a Marxist-Leninist, considering that if we analyze it in a general scenario, a good part of the student movements use tend the idea of \u200b\u200bbeing anti-fascists, against homophobia, misogyny, violence, machismo, BUT they still condone this daily, whether through speeches, actions, or the segregationism itself implemented among people from different movements that in theory they should support each other (just like UJS does!). \nI think it all depends on how you look at it, for example, I can mention here several negligences that the movements themselves cause, but in no way should I crucify them as if they didn't make any difference in the Marxist formation of a young person!! \nI tell you from my own experience, I have always been a person who was interested in Marxism, but the idea of \u200b\u200bnot being able to share what I learned with other people left me frustrated.\nThat's when I met UJR, they were people who welcomed me and answered questions that I had no idea how to ask! People who still mobilize today to come and visit a rural town with very few inhabitants and carry out brigades. Thanks to them, I had the strength to raise awareness among students at the school where I am, to hold conversation circles, lectures, actions that, however small they may be, are extremely necessary, such as telling students that it is not right for a teacher to act incorrectly. with a student and get away with it. \n\nAs activists, we understand that this union of youth serves as a learning experience, especially at the beginning of a person's journey as they learn about Marxism, and in addition, we usually take basic courses on various topics open to students. \n\nAs for the newspaper, even though everyone has a different perspective, it is extremely important that we have material like this that serves as a basis for everyone from a student to a worker, for example, these days we went to a terminal and spent the whole day talking with workers about the injustices we suffer daily, whether in transport, in the infrastructure of schools, in universities, in the labor scene, and even though the cover was about Bolsonaro and all those things that are currently being publicized, 99% listened to us and agreed fully. \nI even dare to say that the newspaper becomes a tool that most convinces and attracts workers, as it is something easily accessible at almost zero cost. \n\nI know I'm on a sub that perhaps implements questions about literary works, revolutionary figures, etc. (and OBVIOUSLY this is not a criticism, the worker has and must become aware and study about it!) But I tried to bring a more humanized question about this issue, because for me, it's much more worth going out on the streets talking to workers, going to factory doors, taking advantage of recess to talk to students than living life tied to theory. \nMaybe in your region the movement is in fact very stagnant, but here, even with few soldiers, we managed to fulfill our role as Marxists and denounce what is happening right under the eyes of the population.\n\nI said I would do it in points, but I completely forgot about it, so just ignore the part where I talked about it.",

You seem like a younger person than I am, so you really do not need to feel offended by anything said here or rather have any reason for such. We are not your friends or people that you know. We are just appointing where you are failing and the things that you're doing that are not marxist practices.\n\n>When we go out on the streets to talk to workers, we use newspapers to explain to them everyday situations that surround us, because for me, it would become completely meaningless to talk to a worker who has never heard about Lenin, Marx, communism, surplus value , etc., and most of them did not have the minimum conditions to be literate!\n\nWhat you are describing is an education problem that I can guarantee you, it runs way deeper than taking a newspaper and talk to a random worker that you might never even see again in your life. If you have a compromise with education in to marxist theory, than you need to develop yourself into theory first, so later you can introduce others.\n\n>Our work is like a ladder, we start by presenting social problems and then finally present the theory, providing all the necessary support so that the worker can actually learn about Marxism.\n\nYou present \"social problems\" that people already are a part of and just then you think \"theory\" kicks in? A \"social problem\" is already something theorized by a human being. Then what? What happens later? Is the \"worker\" able to develop into marxism and give criticism to the org that provided the \"assistance\" that you are referring?\n\n>It scares me that they misinterpreted my comment,\n\nNo one here did that. This is just not the place where you tell people what a \"communist\" party is doing and people just applaud you like in a meeting with revisionists, most people here have years of experience dealing with the exact same orgs that you are a part of, so taking advice and treating like a honest criticism is rather way more positive than this feeling that someone misinterpreted what you said (which is a liberal response). We all know what you said. It's just that we have heard or read the same thing before from someone who is at one of those orgs and need to defend the org.",

Do you have a job anyway? The only way to be any protected as someone who has a job is through the marxist theory.\n\n>denounce what is happening right under the eyes of the population.\n\nThe population is already aware of their condition without you. Rebellions happened in what today is brazilian territory way before socialism became a scientifical theory.\n\n>As activists, we understand that this union of youth serves as a learning experience\n\nYou are learning how to be a pretensious liberal. If you keep doing it, you will see where it will lead.",
