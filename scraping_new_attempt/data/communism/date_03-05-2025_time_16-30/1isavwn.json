    "selftext": "I recommend reading this article by Stephen Gowans, it's called 'Do Publicly Owned Planned Economies Work?'\n\nhttps://gowans.blog/2012/12/21/do-publicly-owned-planned-economies-work/\n\nThe author speaks about the Soviet economy, its many successes, and also seeks to explain why its rapid econonomic growth slowed down from the mid-1970s on, leading to Gorbachov's free market reforms that killed it.\n\nHe has a solid, known, but certainly non-mainstream thesis (by which I mean its a known thesis that makes a lot of sense but is rejected by most scholars) on why the Soviet economy slowed down. He explains it well, and defends it well in the comments section (which I highly recommend reading as well). It can essentially be summed up as:\n\n1: Planned economy worked very well in comparison to capitalism. Its growth record is a prime example.\n\n2: The economic slowdown (or the 'period of stagnation' as it is often called) was not the consequence of some inherent flaw in socialism or the centralized planned economy, but the consequence of the cold war (particularly the arms race between the two superpowers, which was already bad in and on itself, but got much worse under the Reagan administration, that began an actual campaign to cripple the Soviet economy and induce a crisis in it). The cold war hurt Soviet economic growth in various ways he details in the article.\n\n3: This economic slowdown was what led to Gorbachov's reforms. But as we know he screwed up by re-introducing capitalism in the economy, which led to the crisis and eventual collapse of the economy.\n\nBesides listing and explaining the many successes of the Soviet economy and therefore debunking many myths, the relevant-to-this-post part of the article is the one explaining how the cold war and the arms race slowed down economic development in various ways, which it does very well.\n\nI like this theory a lot because, contrary to almost all other theses, it puts the blame for economic slowdown on exogenous factors as the original cause for all (or most) evils (internal economic problems) of the USSR.\n\nMost analists, economists, historians, etc. focus on finding what went wrong internally, ignoring the possibility that whatever went wrong internally had its root in an outside cause: the cold war.\n\nA prime example:\n\nMany point out to the lack of innovation, technological backwardness and slack labor discipline under socialism as one of the factors that caused the economic slowdown of the 70s. I think they are very right on this, but all that can be traced back to the cold war: the Soviet Union, justifiably obsessed with defense (they had been invaded thrice since the bolsheviks came to power), and now more than ever because of the US threat, spent an enormous amount of financial, natural and human resources (money, producer goods, the best and most researchers, engineers, scientists, etc.) in the military-industrial complex to achieve and then maintain military parity with the west and deter agression, logically depriving/starving the civilian-consumer sector of all these precious resources.\n\nThe result?\n\nIt produced innovative, high quality and technologically advanced products in both the weapons and space industries (which by itself already debunks the myth that a planned economy 'can't produce quality goods' and 'kills innovation') at the cost of producing a low quantity and low quality of goods for the population by still using obsolete equipment and techniques.\n\nSo yes, the Soviet civilian economy was lagging behind the west in regards of quality, quantity, variety, etc. due to, among other things, the use of obsolete equipment, and this obviously slowed down the economy, but all this happened because of the military pressures of the cold war, not some inherent flaw in socialism or even Soviet socialism (socialism as practiced in the USSR).\n\nHere's an extraction of the article:\n\n'By the 1980s, the USSR was showing the strains of the Cold War. Its economy was growing, but at slower pace than it had in the past. Military competition with its ideological competitor, the United States, had slowed growth in multiple ways. First, R&D resources were being monopolized by the military, starving the civilian economy of the best scientists, engineers, and machine tools. Second, military spending had increased to meet the Reagan administration\u2019s abandonment of detente in favour of a renewed arms race that was explicitly targeted at crippling the Soviet economy. To deter US aggression, the Soviets spent a punishingly large percentage of GDP on the military while the Americans, with a larger economy, spent more in absolute terms but at a lower and more manageable share of national income. Third, to protect itself from the dangers of relying on foreign imports of important raw materials that could be cut off to bring the country to its knees, the Soviet Union chose to extract raw materials from its own vast territory. While making the USSR self-sufficient, internal sourcing ensnared the country in a Ricardian trap. The costs of producing raw materials increased, as new and more difficult-to-reach sources needed to be tapped as the older, easy-to-reach ones were exhausted. Fourth, in order to better defend the country, the Soviets sought allies in Eastern Europe and the Third World. However, because the USSR was richer than the countries and movements it allied with, it became the anchor and banker to other socialist countries, liberation movements... As the number of its allies increased, and Washington manoeuvred to arm, finance, and support anti-communist insurgencies in an attempt to put added strain on the Soviet treasury, the costs to Moscow of supporting its allies mounted. These factors\u2014corollaries of the need to provide for the Soviet Union\u2019s defence\u2014combined to push costs to the point where they seriously impeded Soviet economic growth'",

            "body": "It is positive seeing someone defend a planned economy  against vulgar \"free market=efficiency\" myths. However, the faults of the Soviet Union can not be put on external factors: it is quite obvious that any socialist state that comes into existence will be subject to attacks from reactionary countries, in particular from imperialist ones.\nEvery revolutionary already anticipates that. Would you expect the US not to oppose the Soviet Union?\n\nThe end of the Soviet Union had to do with capitalist restoration and the revisionists that took power after Stalin's death in 1953. Revisionist reforms started long before Gorbachev: Krushchev and Brezhnev had already opened the way for what Gorbachev would end up doing. Unfortunately, I have not yet studied the history of the Soviet Union properly, so I am not yet able to tell you more about revisionism in the URSS. However, I believe that resources about the question are easy to find through a quick search (there are various documents from China until 1976 and from Albania criticizing Soviet revisionism). I just want to stress the point that the causes for the end of the Soviet Union were internal.",

With a logic like this, the construction of socialism too becomes impossible - so what is the purpose of even trying if revisionism is inevitable as you make it seem?\n\nBesides, you say that these reforms were impossible to avoid; and yet you also say that these reforms (although, according to you, a consequence of the Cold War) led to the fall of the Soviet Union. If these reforms necessarily lead to failure, how were they unavoidable? Perhaps something else (hint: continuing to organize society on socialist terms) would have worked out. Don't you think there is a contradiction in what you are saying?",

                            "body": "This is wrong:\n\n\u201cAs opposed to the metaphysical world outlook, the world outlook of materialist dialectics holds that in order to understand the development of a thing we should study it internally and in its relations with other things; in other words, **the development of things should be seen as their internal and necessary self-movement**, while each thing in its movement is interrelated with and interacts on the things around it. **The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing.** There is internal contradiction in every single thing, hence its motion and development. Contradictoriness within a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interrelations and interactions with other things are secondary causes. Thus materialist dialectics effectively combats the theory of external causes, or of an external motive force, advanced by metaphysical mechanical materialism and vulgar evolutionism. It is evident that purely external causes can only give rise to mechanical motion, that is, to changes in scale or quantity, but cannot explain why things differ qualitatively in thousands of ways and why one thing changes into another. As a matter of fact, even mechanical motion under external force occurs through the internal contradictoriness of things.\n\n\u2026\n\nDoes materialist dialectics exclude external causes? Not at all. It holds that external causes are the condition of change and internal causes are the basis of change, and that external causes become operative through internal causes. In a suitable temperature an egg changes into a chicken, but no temperature can change a stone into a chicken, because each has a different basis.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm",

I absolutely want to hear this user's explanations for all these things (which will just be them copying and pasting whatever wikipedia says), because they don't actually have any and their explanation for Soviet history just has no connection to any of these things and these are all unrelated 'events of history' drawn from a deck at random at certain clock moments, like Hearts of Iron 4 or something, rather than being the continuous motion of the same series of events playing out and being fought over.  Meanwhile \"anti-revisionism\" understands and explains all of these things, and offers a consistent evaluation, explaining who was who, and what was actually happening here on Marxist terms.  \n\nAlso I've met Stephen Gowans, he's nice and his article was good if limited, but his hope for radical political change in klanada is the old, revisionist, Brezhnevite Communist Party of Canada, which should tell you already to which dead end where his politics will ultimately lead you.",

Most explanations, then, reflect ulterior motives\u2014making the case that one\u2019s political point of view is proved by the Soviet Union\u2019s demise.** If only the Soviet Union had a multi-party electoral democracy, was decentralized at the point of production, adopted markets, crushed the informal market as Stalin would have, was more supportive of revolutionary movements, allowed more private ownership, etc.\n\nOf course, it could be that the country\u2019s political system and the practices of it leadership were not the ultimate causes of the collapse, and that the ceaseless efforts of the United States to ruin the country eventually produced circumstances which the leadership blundered in reacting to. It\u2019s not so strange that the exponents of political axe-grinding-style explanations adopt a disease model of the Soviet Union\u2019s death (it collapsed under the weight of internal system failures) rather than viewing the death as a murder or suicide.

It has already been shown to you that your and Gowans' approach to history is unscientific. Instead of taking the standpoint of the proletariat in considering the problem of building Socialism in one country (in which the necessary measures to protect the Socialist State against external capitalist aggression is just one aspect among many), you are thinking like a transcendental being observing the events, turning the agents of history into passive entities whose decisions are fully determined by capitalist violence - something external to them. The necessary conclusion is that, since only capitalism has agency, it is eternal; that revolution is an ultimately doomed endeavor. \n\nTherefore, your standpoint is not only completely useless, because when laid out bare it cannot be more than a vulgar description of the appearance of events from the standpoint of an american petty-bourgeois, being incapable of grasping the cause of the events themselves (something only a dialectical materialist approach can do), but it is also very reactionary.\n\nE: it's obvious those are Gowans' words and not yours, at least put them in quotation marks",
