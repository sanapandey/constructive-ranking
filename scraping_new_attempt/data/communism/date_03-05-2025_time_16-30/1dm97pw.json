You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I've heard here and there on this sub and the 101 sub that capitalism has made people more isolated nowadays, but what exactly is meant by that? Concretely, I mean. I think I'm young, so I take the fact of general isolation for granted, but it seems people are alluding to some kind of organizations, activities, or customs that used to exist but no longer do. I get the idea that people spend more time with commodities than other people (social media, entertainment, dating apps, etc.), but I'm having a hard time imagining what this is being contrasted to. It's obvious that people spent more time with each other before the internet, but how has capitalism concretely hindered interpersonal relationships, and since when? Is it primarily the internet we're talking about, or something more basic that's being referred to? Maybe this is a vague or obvious question, but I feel like this shift is a kind of common sense that I don't know where I'd start studying.\n\nMy guess would be that the general tendency of capitalism to commodify all fields of life was facilitated by the invention of the internet which made it easier to commodify relationships with other people. In the general alienation people have from each other in capitalism, social media and content creators appear easier and safer than the risk of making real friendships and being vulnerable in front of other people, and this lead to a converse effect of further reducing people's opportunities to talk to each other and in turn reinforcing this isolation through commodity consumption.",

                    "body": "I've mentioned isolation a few times recently if that is in part what you are referring to. Part of my usage of the word is my subjective experiences offline with politics and the struggles that entails. The other part is the objective state of Communism today and the generally disparate spread of what anti-revisionist forces exist in the imperial core. Mentioning the imperial core as well, I've really only heard the usage of isolation you described being presented in the context of imperial core, specifically Amerikan, youth. I feel some shame in not having established a more international understanding of how postmodernism (really the root of where this articulation of \"isolation\" stems from) has established itself around the world, as that would present a deeper grasp of its features beyond just a u.$. context.\n\n>Maybe this is a vague or obvious question, but I feel like this shift is a kind of common sense that I don't know where I'd start studying\n\nI just finished the essay version of Jameson's *Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism* I believe that will be a good place to start if you haven't yet read it. \n\n[https://web.education.wisc.edu/halverson/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2012/12/jameson.pdf](https://web.education.wisc.edu/halverson/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2012/12/jameson.pdf)\n\nReading that after having read Sam King's *Lenin's Theory of Imperialism Today* just before, gave a very solid foundation to work on understanding common sense things like \"isolation\" and removing the mystification that comes with it being \"common sense.\"\n\n[https://vuir.vu.edu.au/37770/1/KING,%20Samuel%20-%20thesis\\_nosignature.pdf](https://vuir.vu.edu.au/37770/1/KING,%20Samuel%20-%20thesis_nosignature.pdf)\n\n>In the general alienation people have from each other in capitalism, social media and content creators appear easier and safer than the risk of making real friendships and being vulnerable in front of other people, and this lead to a converse effect of further reducing people's opportunities to talk to each other and in turn reinforcing this isolation through commodity consumption.\n\nWhat you're missing is *why* this appears easier and safer beyond \"being vulnerable\" which again has its origins in that aforementioned common sense. Your previous sentence on capitalism's colonization of all fields of life approaches this but obviously needs to be situated historically.",

From the past 10 years, the pro-corporate BJP\u2019s anti-people policies have caused enormous problems for the people and they have taught a lesson to Modi-Shah, who were repeatedly shouting, this time more than 400 seats. People have exposed the bogus development model of BJP and its slogan of Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vishwas(with everyone help and with everyone confidence) and shown the power of people in this election. They smashed the hopes of the imperialist forces and the domestic corporate houses to make Modi win the election with absolute majority, so that they can loot the enormous natural resources of the country with more speed. With their help, the hindutva forces\u00a0to make India a developed country by 2047 (hindu nation, brought forward Surajkund policy in 2022. The people of India\u00a0have\u00a0rejected\u00a0all\u00a0these\u00a0policies\u00a0and\u00a0poured\u00a0water\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0dream to make\u00a0government\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0strength\u00a0of\u00a0their own.\u00a0By facing the wrath of the people from 10 years, Narendra Modi in a opportunistic way, merging with regional parties, has become Prime Minister for the third time.\n\n>The people of the country have clearly declared their stand against the government\u2019s corporatization and militarization policies in this election. They give their verdict against the hindutva policies. \\[...\\]\n\n[https://icspwindia.wordpress.com/2024/06/23/observe-world-protest-day-against-kagaar-communist-party-of-india-maoist-central-committee/](https://icspwindia.wordpress.com/2024/06/23/observe-world-protest-day-against-kagaar-communist-party-of-india-maoist-central-committee/)\n\nOn the one hand revolutionary MLM parties rightly call for the boycott of elections but on the other they are writing about the relative 'defeat' of the BJP led NDA government as the rejection of fascism by the people. bsCEM in their analysis of Indian elections also outlined its hollow nature and how it does not reflect the actual concern of the people:\n\n>The sheer backwardness of production relations in India, the existence of antiquated social and labour divisions such as the caste system and the presence of a fascist movement within this same society, leave little room for concerns of democracy and development within the masses. Votes are cast based on distributions of money and assets during election campaigns, alignment with caste interests, and choices of the lesser evil by oppressed religious and caste groups seeking protection from the fascist onslaught, and many other such reasons. The number of voters who show up to the polling booth with a democratic consciousness remains exceedingly small, as evidenced by reports from the bourgeois press, which document the motivations of those who show up at the polling booths.  \n  \n\\[...\\]\n\n>In this context participation in elections does not expose anything to the masses which they already didn\u2019t know \u2013 the working masses battered by decades after decades of sham promises, worsening working and living conditions, all under the veneer of this \u201cdemocracy\u201d, do not hope of emancipation from the ballot box. Participation in Indian elections in either \u201ctactics\u201d or strategy only serves to discredit communists amongst the masses. \n\n\\[...\\]\n\n>The prevailing consciousness among the Indian masses is marked by its historical affiliations to religious beliefs and feudal practices, which hold a far more potent sway over their hearts and minds than the ideals of bourgeois democracy.\n\n[https://bethealternate.wordpress.com/2024/05/26/bscems-position-paper-on-elections-and-the-relevance-of-the-sloganboycott-elections/](https://bethealternate.wordpress.com/2024/05/26/bscems-position-paper-on-elections-and-the-relevance-of-the-sloganboycott-elections/)\n\nThere are other more detailed analyses as well but this gets the point across succinctly. \n\nMy overall question is: what is the point of hailing the relative defeat of the BJP led NDA? The Maoist's statement correctly again states that:\n\n>But they will not think to move away from their fascist policies, despite the people\u2019s verdict and global protest.\n\nThe statement seems to be aimed towards the more petty-bourgeoisie readers/liberals who still hold on to electoral politics as the way out of fascism. But even then the latter half of the statement contradicts itself. The Maoists have never endorsed the parliamentary path and have made concrete analyses as to why it does not reflect the will of the people. However, to label the defeat as a rejection by the people just seems to be lazy that foregoes a concrete analysis of what actually is happening on the ground (which is more of a job for the liberal media and intellectuals).",
