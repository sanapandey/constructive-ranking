Some kind of analysis and a reason for why you're interested in sharing this movie in particular?\n\nThis is a better place to review a movie than IMDB or Letterboxd.\n\nE: Don't get me wrong; I'd be interested in hearing about this movie and your perspective on it. It's an opportunity to educate each other on Soviet cinema, with a special focus on Moldova which gets little attention.",

The film presents the Soviet vision of\u00a0[the Tatarbunar uprising (](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C4%83scoala_de_la_Tatarbunar)\u00a0as you probably guessed, it's a mess of Soviet propaganda, I'm surprised it wasn't promoted by Sor and the Socialists in this campaign). In the main role is the famous Russian actor Oleg Iankovsky. The music was composed by maestro Eugen Doga.\n\nWhy did you post about the same movie on 2 different subreddits and say it's \"the truth\" here and say it's \"a mess of Soviet propaganda\" on r/moldova ?\n\nEDIT: you posted this \"mess of soviet propaganda\" version on a ton of different subreddits, but slightly edited it for here.\n\nEDIT 2: My fault for using translate.\n\nhe just says quote \"Of course the movie has soviet propaganda in it\"\n\nHere is a link from an english version he posted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/1gu1n0y/soviet\\_historicalpropaganda\\_film\\_wrath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/1gu1n0y/soviet_historicalpropaganda_film_wrath/)\n\nJust a karma farmer I assume.",
