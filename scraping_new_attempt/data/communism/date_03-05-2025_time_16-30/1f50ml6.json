No hate against trotskyist comrades, I'm just fundamentally not a trotskyist, and wonder what make Britain so immune to anti-revisionist communism?",

They don't have identical lines, but they're tied to each other.\n\nOff the top of my head there's also the Hull and Leeds Communist Groups, Plaid Gomiwnyddol Cymru in Wales, the Scottish Socialist Republicans(?), Marxist-Leninist-Maoists in Britain (mostly London based I believe) and The Welsh Underground Network.\n\nThen there are umpteen thousand Trotskyist organisations that change their names every other week and mostly sell papers.",
