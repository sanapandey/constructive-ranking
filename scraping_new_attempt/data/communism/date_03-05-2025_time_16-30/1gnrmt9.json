    "selftext": "I was reading through Ernst Mandel\u2019s [Introduction to Capital Volume 2](http://digamo.free.fr/mandelik.pdf), where on page 31, and beyond, he states\n>> In the Soviet Union and other countries where capitalism has been overthrown, Marx's reproduction schemas have bene widely used as instruments of 'socialist planning'. We do not deny that, by analogy, these schemas may be useful tools for studying specific problems of inter-department structure and dynamics in all kinds of society. But it has first to be clearly understood what is being done in such a case. For, we repeat, the schemas refer to commodity production and to dual flows of commodities and money incomes. To extend their use to societies which have transcended generalized commodity production, where the means of production are, in their essential mass, use-values distributed by the state (the planning authorities) according to a plan, rather than commodities sold on the basis of their 'value' - this leads to an accumu\u00ad lation of paradoxes. of which the authors are generally not even conscious.\n\nDid the USSR use the Marx reproductive schemas in a distorted way? If so, from what periods and what consequences do they have? The question was asked in r/communism 12 years ago, albeit [without answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/s/m0MF6kBKuh)\n\n>> A good example is provided by the late Maurice Dobb. In the fifties, he participated in a 'great debate' among Soviet and East European economists revolving around Stalin's so-called 'law of the priority development of the means of production under socialism' and the establishment of an optimum rate of growth for both departments. Forgetting that what was involved in Marx's reproduction schemas was value calculation of commodities, Dobb 'proved' that an increased rate of growth of consumer goods in the future was 'impossible' unless the\npresent rate of growth of department I was higher than that of depart\u00ad ment I I . Now, a policy which sacrifices the consumption of four generations of workers and their families merely to increase the rate of growth of thatconsumptionstartingwith the fifth generation has nothing in common with an 'ideal socialist norm', and cannot be rationally motivated except in terms of purely political contingencies.\n\nHere, Mandel seems to be caricaturing the prioritization of means of production over consumption, but he failed to account for the underdevelopment of Russia, instead buying into some form of material incentives; if the party is connected to the masses, they can ask them to withhold immediate rising standards. \n\nWhen I searched for \u201csocial reproduction schema in USSR,\u201d on google the AI quoted a chapter from a book on Marx and Keynes by Paul Mattick published in 1969; the chapter of the title being [\u201cValue and Socialism\u201d](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1969/marx-keynes/ch22.htm#n26)\n\nHe is anti-Leninist, but discussed the use of the reproduction schema by the bolsheviks from early on,\n>> When planning became a possibility for the Bolshevik state, it nevertheless found its theoretical starting-point in Marx, that is, in his idea of social production as a reproduction process. The planners thought Marx\u2019s schemata of simple and enlarged reproduction, which Marx had developed from the physiocrat Francois Quesnay\u2019s Tableau \u00e9conomique, and which he presents in the second volume of Capital, [6] applicable to all social formations and particularly useful in solving the problems of a socialist economy. It was on the basis of these schemata that Soviet economists constructed macro-economic models depicting the feasibility of a balanced planned economy\n\nWhich sounds a bit out of place given that according to [Andrew Kliman](https://copejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/andrew-kliman-marx_s-reproduction-schemes-as-an-unbalanced-growth-model.pdf), Lenin, in the Development of Capitalism in Russia, agreed that a corollary of the reproductive schemas is uneven growth in capitalism between department 1 and department 2. \nAnd then Mattick goes to say that Marx never meant to talk about equilibrium growth and that his model is for capitalism, etc.\n\nMore striking from Mattick\u2019s work is a critique of Stalin\u2019s Economic Problems in the USSR, especially his understanding of the Law of Value\n>> What does it actually mean to take the law of value into account? According to Stalin it means, first of all, \u201cto train business executives to count production magnitudes ... to improve methods of production, to lower production costs, to practice cost accounting, and to make enterprise pay.\u201d[22] Although in Marx\u2019s definition the labor theory of value refers exclusively to capitalist production and the concept of surplus-value to labor exploitation, in Stalin\u2019s definition value theory need not be in contradiction with the requirements of socialism. All that is necessary is to discard \u201ccertain concepts taken from Marx\u2019s Capital, such as \u2018necessary labor\u2019 and \u2018surplus labor,\u2019 \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018surplus\u2019 product, \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018surplus\u2019 labor time.\n\n>> The confusion which surrounds the labor theory of value does not reflect the theoreticians\u2019 muddled thinking alone; it results from their attempt to describe a non-socialist system of production and distribution as a socialist society. They do so because, by their definition, socialism is state-control over the means of production and centrally-planned determination of the national economy. It seems to them then that planning which fits the social needs and economic necessities, is planning in accordance with the law of value. Under capitalism, it is said, \u201cthe law of value acts as an elemental law of the market, inevitably linked with the destruction of productive forces, with crisis, with anarchy of production. Under socialism it acts as a law of the planned administration of the national economy, under the conditions of the development of an economy free from crises.\u201d[26]\n\n>> To say that the law of value underlies economic processes is to say that there is some definite regulation of social production de spite the lack of concern for, and the practical impossibility of, such regulation under private property relations. The \u201cregulation\u201d is brought about by way of market competition and crises. But if there is no private ownership of capital, no competition, no private accumulation; if production is centrally planned; if prices and wages are regulated, and the expansion of production consciously determined \u2013 then there cannot arise those results of competition and crises which manifest the operation of the law of value. To apply the law of value \u201cconsciously\u201d in socialism could only mean to incorporate the effects of competition and crisis into the p fling mechanism \u2013 in other words, to re-institute the market and private property, which is obviously nonsense\n\n>> It is perhaps for this reason that Stalin spoke of a law of value \u201cstrictly limited and placed within definite bounds,\u201d i.e., one which fully operates only in the sphere of circulation confined to personal consumption, and which \u201cinfluences\u201d the sphere of production only because the latter cannot disregard the principle of profitability, even though this principle is modified by conscious decisions on the part of the planning authorities. But even though the \u201cmodified\u201d law of value presumably affects production and regulates distribution, Stalin saw no social division between value and surplus-value, and none between necessary and surplus labor, because by definition the whole social product belongs now to all of society.\n\n>> Forced industrialization by political means proceeded from government direction to direct government control and, in the process, created the conditions for a planned economic development. The plans reflected the general backwardness; they could not be any better than the conditions they tried to alter.\n\nEssentially, it is saying that planned economy as it existed in the USSR was implicitly a stepping stone towards capitalism for all its capital accumulation in underdeveloped countries. The whole article is worth reading, especially the critique of USSR. What parts of the critique of Stalin\u2019s Economic Problems relevant, which can be considered the fault of Mattick\u2019s interpretation of Stalin\u2019s text?\n\nSince it was published in 1969, I\u2019m not sure what period of the USSR he was referring to or that for him it was always this way ever since Lenin, and markedly under Stalin. However, I\u2019m aware that [Che Guevara](https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/yaffeh/che-critic.htm) himself made a similar critique of USSR in mid-1960s relying on capitalist relations/categories for its planning, concluding that it was moving towards capitalism at that moment.\n\nThe problem seems to be the definition of socialism itself, where Mattick views it as having abolished law of value completely, whereas Guevara believe the law of value still exists, but is trending towards 0.",
