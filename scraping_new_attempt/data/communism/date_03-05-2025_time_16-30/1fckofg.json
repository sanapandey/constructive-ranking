You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No society has yet reached this stage, while multiple have had a socialist state. Socialism is this intermediary stage where the state is an apparatus of the workers to organise society in its path towards communism. \n\nUntil there is \"communism\" there will be class war. So yes, the state and other forms of workers organising is necessary. No communist will refute this. As communists we therefore see \"socialism\" as a necessary stage.\nWhat you describe is \"anarchism\", where one thinks can go from capitalism to a stateless society while skipping the socialist phase. This is false.",

                            "body": "Fist off, you have to decouple the state from the economy. The socialist state's purpose is to reconcile the conflict between the ruling class (proletariat) and the underclass (bourgeoisie). The state is administered by representatives, but they do not have to be a minority holding a majority of power. They can be many representatives commanding a small segment of the state's assets. A diffusion of power is much harder to corrupt than a concentration of it. The current issue with capitalist states is capital and concentration of power. Virtually everyone in the state has capital interests to defend and hold a majority of power. This creates a conflict of interest.\n\nThe state must be completely isolated from the economy. The proletariat manages the economic side through elected worker councils. No one privately owns any means of production. The state prevents the councils from being taken over by the bourgeoisie. Without exclusive possession of capital, the bourgeois would have little power to revolt without the support of the proletariat. The state relies on proletariat support to exist. Thus, it's the proletariat's duty to maintain oversight of the state to be vigilant against corruption of the state. The state monitors the worker councils. The proletariat monitors the state. The councils serve the proletariat.\n\nA limited scope of authority and responsibility is important. The state only serves to prevent counter-revolution from the bourgeois. The councils serve the workers to organize the means of production. They are all elected by an approval voting system. Each voter applies an approval rating of 0 to 9 for each candidate (e.g. so voters can vote for multiple preferred candidates) and the candidate with the most points wins. The workers reserve the right to vote to remove any representative in the state, or worker council, by the same approval system. If a representative of either state or council does not meet the expectations of the workers, the workers can vote to have an election to replace that member in the same manner they elected the previous. The incumbent is included in the election. If a new candidate wins, the incumbent vacates their position. If an incumbent refuses to vacate, the state removes them by force. If a state incumbent refuses to vacate, they are removed by the workers.\n\nHierarchies are not classes. Classes describe how we relate to the means of production. Capitalists (bourgeoisie) own the means of production and use it as leverage to exploit workers to extract surplus value. The workers (proletariat) exchange their labor value for wages to buy the goods and services they themselves produced. Being an administrator on a state or worker council does not make someone a member of a different class. A state rep or worker rep is simply another job role in society.",
