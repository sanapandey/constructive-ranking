            "body": ">Maduro has secured another 6 years in power\n\nThat is far from secure. The election was a tool to maintain the relative hegemony of the nationalist bourgeoisie over the comprador bourgeoisie and not the primary one. It will be in the next few weeks that the real struggle for hegemonic will occur in the military, inter-bourgeois conflict, and imperialist intervention.\n\nChavismo has done a good job using elections as an effective tool. Far better than in other Pink Tide nations where elections have either caused systematic dysfunction or internal divisions in the movement. But it is still significantly worse and less democratic than the Cuban system, there is nothing innovative about a regularized calendar of fascist coup attempts. Not that Venezuelan capitalism is really comparable to Cuban socialism, rather that yesterday's election has only served as another excuse for the opposition to claim victory and the US to marshall its regional forces for whatever coup attempt is coming.\n\nOther than that, there's not much to say. Chavismo long ago lost the material basis for its existence. While it has maintained a relatively egalitarian distribution of its meager resources, the opposition is correct that the total wealth of the country would increase if it won. That this is the result of imperialist sabotage is sour grapes (or less callously, necessary but not sufficient as an explanation), imperialism is a given and the Soviet Union (and to a lesser extent Cuba) already showed it can be overcome by socialism. The persistence of Maduro is more the result of the incompetence of the opposition and missteps by the US.\n\nOf course, complaining about Chavismo is also sour grapes. We've had 20 years to use the relatively open space it created to organize for communism. The PCV is paying for its earlier opportunism and Americans have no right to complain when we have yet to even turn sanctions into a political issue outside of Apartheid states. That Biden has implemented more sanctions than any other president in history is not even considered in opportunist calculations of \"anti-fascism,\" showing how taken for granted they are.\n\nhttps://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2024/07/26/us-sanctions-which-countries/\n\nThough we are all victim to it, it is the habit of forming opinions when reacting to world events that is the problem. By the time the media has reported on something, it is far too late to intervene independently in a communist manner. Let Maduro do what he wishes, the PCV has taken the courageous step of breaking with its past errors. Now we have to support that step with our own intervention against revisionism, opportunism, and social fascism.",

                            "body": "Venezuela is unique in facing extreme hostility from imperialism despite not having built anything \n\n>Chavez\u2019s programme was one of redistribution of the value gained by Venezuela\u2019s non-oil capitalist sector, the oil industry and multi-nationals.  The ownership and production of the non-oil sectors was not brought under state control to plan the economy.  V\u00edctor \u00c1lvarez, an economist who was part of the government under Ch\u00e1vez, notes that private industry actually increased under Ch\u00e1vez, despite the government nationalizing a number of important industries. Most important, Ch\u00e1vez failed to wean Venezuela from oil dependency, with the percentage of government export revenues derived from oil increasing from 67 percent in 1998 to 96 percent in 2016.\n\nhttps://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2024/07/27/venezuela-the-end-game/\n\nIf Cuba abandoned its socialist system, not only would it lose all the gains of the revolution, it would be reduced to the level of Haiti or Jamaica. Even Iran, which is far from socialism, would see massive privatization if a western friendly government we're installed. The only real fear is that oil would be reprivatized but this is unlikely, wealth and redistribution is a basic policy of the national bourgeoisie and does not rely on the PSUV\n\n>In 1970 Venezuela had become the richest country in the region and one of the 20 richest countries in the world, ahead of countries like Greece, Israel, and Spain. But this wealth was almost entirely based on one commodity, oil; Venezuela has some of the largest proved reserves in the world.  Then came the downturn in the world economy during the 1970s.  Between 1978 and 2001, Venezuela\u2019s economy went sharply in reverse, with non-oil GDP declining by almost 19 percent and oil GDP by an astonishing 65 percent\n\nThe rise and fall of Venezuela's economy is cyclical and the tendency today is controlled capitalism, as in China, Russia (which has survived sanctions despite the restoration of capitalism), and similar oil states like Algeria and Angola. That doesn't mean I'm indifferent to the elections. After the extreme contractions of the past decade, Maduro is right that there is significant room for economic growth and that, if he is in power, this will be handled in a more egalitarian manner. But it is also true that those who fled the country, voted for the opposition, or didn't vote at all, are not traitors or brainwashed and it is not entirely the fault of imperialism, except in the sense that Venezuela's economy is dependent on the imperialist world system.\n\n>Every committed socialist movement that successfully established political power knew beforehand that they would have far better immediate economic returns if they were practicing liberalism and cooperation with imperialism. Everyone knows this, but socialism lives regardless\n\nChavismo has been in power for 25 years, now looking like at least 31. Any initial gains of the early Chavez period are long gone.\n\nI sympathize with what you're saying, I also did not like the casual reference to \"probably\" electoral fraud. But it is you who is nihilistic, since the world right now is devolving into barbarism and fascism. Venezuela's \"socialism in the 21st century\" is not an alternative to capitalism, it is nothing. We are well past the point of defending it as some kind of vague political inspiration in the region. The pink tide is long receded and the economic collapse of Venezuela is unprecedented.\n\n>From 2014 to 2021, Venezuela suffered one of the worst economic crises in modern history. The economy contracted by 86 percent. Poverty rose to an estimated 96 percent in 2019. Inflation reached an absurd level of 350,000 percent that same year. In 2018 nearly a third of the population suffered undernourishment. And roughly a quarter of Venezuelans have since fled in an unprecedented migration that now exceeds 7.7 million.\n\nThis is comparable to wartime destruction, for which the response of the PSUV was to move right.\n\n>Let\u2019s just start the coup now and get it over with.\n\nAs I said in my post, it is this fundamentally reactive approach towards reality that is the problem. The elections are simply one moment in a long struggle against capitalism, in which the PSUV has been powerless.",

Today's \"geopolitics\" grifters were all in favor of the invasion or didn't exist in the American media at that time and most of them were in favor of the invasion of Syria. But that was 10 years ago. In the case of Venezuela, we've had 25 years of following your priorities. What has it gotten us? Economic collapse and serving as the tail of the dog of imperialism, following wherever it goes. There has to be another way \n\nWhat you may have missed, at least for me, is the rise of Dengism which is a right-wing approach towards the same priorities. Venezuela is perhaps the last progressive capitalist regimes to defend on these terms. Now, those same priorities applied to Russia lead to deeply reactionary conclusions. China itself is more ambiguous but the politics in the US based on it are also reactionary, both deeply hostile to the history of socialism and actually existing revolutionary movements (you must choose between the Chinese system and the Filipino revolutionaries opposed to it - you cannot have both and you cannot defer to \"reality\" since both actually exist). \n\nThe alternative has problems that must be worked out. Nobody wants to repeat the logic of 1970s anti-revisionism which had to justify collaboration with apartheid South Africa in Angola because whatever opposed Soviet social imperialism was progressive. That does appear to be the direction the communist party of Venezuela is heading, if its collaboration with the right is to be believed. But your way of thinking is a dead end, I've had quite enough of the naked opportunism and unprincipled reformism of the PSL (which is the most effective and coherent advocate of this political approach) for one lifetime.",

In every example you can give, the resulting power vacuum left after the fallout of regime change would bring forth brutal fascism and chaos ala Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine (in other words, a far more formidable opponent for socialists than the current leaders).

You're right about the nature of the forces that have taken power in any state that is remotely antagonistic to US imperialism, that has not changed since the failed hope that \"democratic\" socialism would replace whatever actually existed in Eastern Europe. But like I said, it was when this position was clearest that this was a fringe position. How many \"communists\" today were involved in the world social forum? Or participated in the formation of ALBA? Venezuela has survived long enough to become the object of today's \"anti-imperialism,\" and retains many progressive features even if it never broke with capitalism substantively. But right wing \"anti-imperialism\" is a new phenomenon that derives from growing inter-imperialist competition. Rather than \"socialism in the 21st century,\" it relies on national chauvanism, cultural particularism, and conspiratorial anti-liberalism (and of course anti-communism). In your reactive state where you act only to prevent things from getting worse, you've been outmaneuvered by the right, who have a positive project to link the right wing parties of \"multipolarity\" across the globe. \n\nChina is not quite as explicitly reactionary as Russia, if only because the ideology of the Chinese communist party is incoherent and vacuous, but it too is part of a rising world system very similar to what Lenin faced on the eve of WWI.

I was criticising PCV's electoral alliance with compradors against Maduro in that comment and that is the crucial point. Every candidate that has been allowed to run against him is a reactionary, including the one PCV is supporting, so what is the point of stressing that the electoral results were defrauded? If PCV was not allowed to run a candidate and no other progressive candidate was permitted as well (they were supporting an independent fellow traveller before supporting the current reactionary alliance but he was barred as well) they should be denouncing the elections themselves as fraud as no progressive options were allowed on the ballot and the communist party was hijacked.\n\nYou are claiming that me saying the electoral results were probably defrauded means I support the opposition or a coup but it's exactly the opposite. If the comprador opposition did win the election, which is likely considering the catastrophic economic conditions and heavy imperialist support, then I have no problem with Maduro defrauding the results to remain in power. I would say this is positive even for PCV, as a comprador regime would be objectively worse for communist organizing. Whatever promises they were given by the \"social democratic\" parties they are supporting would be completely dropped as soon as they got in power as has happened so many times in the past.\n\nIf the communist party is no longer being allowed to operate legally then one option is ramp up clandestine operations, not supporting reactionaries and compradors due to a lack of alternatives.\n\nAs for your main point, Venezuela is not attempting socialism, it's a semi-colonial capitalist state completely dependent on oil revenues. All Chaves did was nationalize some strategic sectors and increase the redistribution system through social programs with oil revenue. When the economy inevitably started to falter the imperialists smelled blood in the water and began the sanctions regime to topple the government and revert the small amount of progressive changes that had been undertaken. The only lesson that can be extracted here is that there can be no partial revolution, if the Bolivarian revolution can be called one at all. You either go all they way to a fully planned socialist economic system to resist the onslaught and attain a degree of autonomy to develop independently of the imperialist world system or you fail and collapse as Venezuela has.",

As long as the PCV clings to this mythology and avoids confronting its past errors, it can never win.\n\nTo be fair it's not clear if that's the party's view or your own. I imagine it's somewhere between the two, standing on a real analysis of Chavez would require a much more substantial break than the PCV has shown. Its break with Maduro seems to be a matter of survival rather than a reevaluation of decades of reformism and revisionism.",
