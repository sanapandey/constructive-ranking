            "body": "\n*** \n\nModerating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All the episodes that showed the most striking revolutionary actions and calls to fight the capitalists were not released. They are still somewhere in the archive of the studio that stole the people's property. The series is called: \u0412.\u0418. \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d. \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 (\u0422\u041e \u042d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d, 1985) I hope there are subtitles and you can watch it.  \nI also want to recommend my personal favorite films about great revolutionaries and their lives, including Lenin: \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u0435 (1937 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d. \u0432\u0435\u0440.),  \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 1981, \u0428\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0438 \u043a \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0412 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 1961, \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0427\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432 (1941), \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\\[1938\\], \u0412\u0438\u0445\u0440\u0438.\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0435 1953, \u0414\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 1936, \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0432 1918 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443, \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 1919 \u0433\u043e\u0434 (1951), \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0435\u0439 (1947) (its very good movie), \u0427\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0441 \u0440\u0443\u0436\u044c\u0451\u043c (1938 original version), \u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u044e\u043b\u044f (1968), \u042f\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0432 (1940).  \nUsing any title on YouTube, I think you will easily find any film. Some, such as Light over Russia or Lenin in October, Lenin in 1919 - are very strong films. Yes, they are fictional, this is not a documentary chronicle, but they are recreated in those years when people were guided by a scientific approach and tried to do everything conscientiously. In the film about Chkalov, of course, there are excesses, for example, Stalin speaks too pompously in places. Being a modest person, he would hardly have said some things and would hardly have approved of such a sycophantic approach to his person. But there are not many such moments and for the most part everything looks good.  \nI would also like to highly recommend you watch the trilogy about the great writer Maxim Gorky. It's called \"\u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\", \"\u0412 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u0445\", \"\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u044b\". The first part is easier to find by writing it like this: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0413\u043e\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e (1938) \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f, The second part: \u0412 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u0445 (1938) \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f. Thirt: \u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u044b (1939) \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f.  \nThis trilogy is an autobiography, telling about his childhood, youth and school years. This film, like no other, very clearly reflects how ordinary people lived in those years and how terrible it all looked, what they had to go through. Of course, the film does not show all the horrors and to understand more fully you need to read \"Notes from the Village\" or \"The Life of Ivan\". But much will become clear about the situation of the peasants, people who did not belong to the rich owners and why the people rebelled and made a revolution and half the globe became \"red\", and the capitalists organized a mass extermination of communists.\n\nI hope you like some of this.",

Eisenstein is a great director, and it's interesting seeing how the October Revolution was presented in the early days of the USSR, but I would say if you want more pleasant viewing it would be best to go for something more modern - though you will learn a lot from Eiseinstein's work.",
