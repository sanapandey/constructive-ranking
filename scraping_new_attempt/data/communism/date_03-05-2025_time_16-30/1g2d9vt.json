I imagine that many users on this subreddit relies on it relatively heavily, most notably for borrowing both the classics and also BPP/BLA/general New Communist Movement works from [archive.org](http://archive.org) but also for the Wayback Machine's archiving of things such as comments on here, or old PCP/MIM/RAIL/Struggle Sessions (one of these things is not like the others, of course) stuff. I find it relatively likely that in the next five to ten years, the Internet Archive and particularly the Wayback Machine will no longer exist; is it in any way worthwhile for communists to take attempts at archiving important internet-communist polemics, theoretical works, and debates? Or is this an endeavor that would take more time than it's worth, and we should just consign any lost works to the confused and often contradictory tides of e-communism? (This ties into a broader discussion regarding the role of the internet in communism that we've been having in a couple scattered threads for the last couple months.)",

I think in Spain and Italy there a few of them too.\n\n\nI have noticed that they are mostly present in places where, until a few years ago, anarchists had their biggest presence.\nIn particular I'm talking about the north of Portugal, and the Porto metropolitan area specifically, where small agricultural production (and production in general) was/is the most prevalent, in comparison to the south, where there are what we call \"Latif\u00fandio\", big plantations. The north always had more anarchists.\n\n\n\nIt seems like, in the last few years, leftcommunism is slowly replacing anarchism in being the ideology of some of the college/fresh out of college leftist youth. Perhabs this is only a trend in countries where anarchism had a lot of presence (especially in the beginning of the 20th Century), like I said south of Europe countries.",

For all their failings and faults, anarchists have mostly been pretty good and pretty consistent with their support for Palestine, which has placed them into a (somewhat) real conflict with the liberal society that they exist as a part of.  If you are serious about your ideology, then this is an inevitable consequence and anarchists facing hostility from liberals over their Palestine support have to dig in their heels and actually be a part of the struggle, even if still fairlyfar away from the real danger.  But this spoils some of the appeal of anarchism, since it now comes with conflict and consequences that you cannot immediately divorce yourself from, especially in liberal society, with people you actually know.  \n\nSo instead, a 'neutral' conflict-averse, liberal-safe radical leftism or \"\"\"Marxism,\"\"\" which can say 'both sides' to Israel and Palestine (basically \"all lives matter\" but pretend its Marxist) suddenly is far more appealing because you can remain \"neutral\" to the liberal society you inhabit and 'neutral' to all the liberals around you, especially over this contentious and (if you actually do politics) inescapable issue.  Bet leftkkkoms have the weakest and most tenuous connection to politics, reality, and history of any ideology calling itself Marxist.  For them, this is a perk; you don't need to attend the Palestinian protests, or enter into ideological conflict with your neighbors, you can go back to playing Helldivers with liberals and fascists and \"Marxism\" is just a fun side hobby between gaming sessions.  \n\nOf course, this is vile if you are serious, or even have basic human sympathy for the suffering of Palestinians, but if you are this sort of opportunistic wretched liberal trying to imagine themselves to be a radical while existing comfortably and happily within liberalism, then leftkkkommunism suddenly suits your needs rather well, where anarchism is suddenly sputtering and failing you because of those darn Palestinians getting in your way (and where Maoism has always been utterly repulsive, scary and dangerous).  That they call themselves \"ultraleftist\" is just incorrect since actual ultraleftism is an escalation of conflict, a heightening of violence, and an acceleration of the battles to come -- something leftkkkoms dont actually do at all in the present -- they are merely leftists in words and rightist in essence.  And, as has already been pointed out several times on this subreddit, as soon as you remove their rhetoric and bluster and ask them for their actual politics -- \"what should communists be doing?\" -- they are incapable of providing a single suggestion which differs from the ideas already being endlessly recycled within the DSA (and even then, the right wing of the DSA because they left is actually pushing the Palestine issue into the spotlight of the DSA stage, much to the chagrin of the DSA careerists).",

After all, the leftcom organization that I particularly had in mind was founded before that. I would say that the Palestine situation has accelerated it, since, like you said, leftcommunism became the ideology to follow for people who are afraid of taking a real stance regarding the situation in Palestine.\n\n\nThey are definitely rightist, since they never really take any risks and in fact do even less that the normal revisionist parties. I don't know what ultraleftism (in the sense of a left deviation) really looks like right now. I don't even know if there are any ultraleftists, since I associate (perhabs wrongly) ultraleftism with being adventurist, and there aren't really any groups conducting violent actions isolated from the masses that I'm aware of.",

And the organization itself supports Palestine more or less. At least two other posts were made in response:\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://coletivoruptura.wordpress.com/2024/06/22/tribuna-gaza-no-sistema-mundo-capitalista-uma-resposta-a-csr/\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://coletivoruptura.wordpress.com/2024/07/05/criticas-inconsequentes-e-um-sionismo-timido-resposta-a-tribuna-de-csr/\u00a0\n\n\nThese posts were better, but for me the problem is in the structure of the organization itself. What sense is it in allowing members of the organization to publicly polemicize with eachother, especially allowing people like the one from the first article to post throught the organization? Anyone complaining about \"antisemitism\" on the left during the genocide going on serves a very specific purpose, to undermine the resistance.\n\n\nI have also seen this article which I didn't like:\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://coletivoruptura.wordpress.com/2024/10/07/esboco-de-uma-posicao-sobre-a-palestina/\n\n\nIn this post they literally call both Hamas AND the PLFP \"burocractic organizations\" (!). They seem to say we should support the efforts of the resistance, but to reject \"nationalisms\" and that any attempt to build a \"capitalist bourgeois State\" should be rejected. Imagine telling a Palestinian that they are wrong for being nationalistic and that they don't deserve to have a State if it's bourgeois.\n\n\nIt seems to me that left-communism is the main tendency within the group, althought they seemingly allow other ideologies including anarchists (?). It has been built on a too wide of a spectrum, and they do not filter people well enough, if at all. The structure keeps the same problems of all the parties that FMR founded: he founded Bloco de Esquerda firstly as a \"radical\" party which would allow trotskyists, maoists, left-coms, libertarian socialists, etc. Something very radical and all. But as time passed, and since there wasn't a central structure, everyone was allowed in the party and so the party became social-democrat, even to the right of the PCP.\n\n\nI have also seen posts on Twitter from left-coms (both portuguese and spanish) saying that the \"Islamic regime\" (!) will not liberate Palestine, that only socialism can, that the working classes must stick together, bla, bla bla. Things in that direction. I will not link them since they are of private individuals.\u00a0\n\n\n(I will later post a comment about my opinion on FMR if I have the time).",

I think they copied the *tribuna* format from the new PCBR (which split from PCB), which allowed everyone, including non-members, to submit on their site articles in preparation for their founding congress, in the name of \"maximum freedom of discussion\". But what was achieved there was only a semblance of discussion, in reality the ideological vagueness prevents any of it from taking place. The result was nothing more than an endless jumble of articles, from ultra-right to ultra-left ones, which barely interacted with each other and were of little use to their congress.\n\n\nAs for CR, due to its small size, their *tribunas* can probably generate a more focused discussion than if it was a larger org. But the result is the same, since the principle of \"maximum freedom of discussion\" cannot by itself prevent revisionism. In fact, it can strengthen it if revisionist, zionist, fascist positions are not promptly excluded from the discussion. Without ideological clarity and consistency, that's impossible. Therefore, despite the proclaimed \"left\" positions of some members, the organization's ideological vagueness causes both eclecticism and the permeation of liberalism in it. As a result (and consistently with leftcommunism in general), most of their articles are very amateurish, without any concrete analysis, full of revolutionary-sounding declarations that turn out to be very reactionary, as for example that last article you linked about palestine.\n\n\nI don't really know the cause of this rise of leftcommunism but in Portugal it is probably related to the increasing inability of JCP to captivate and keep young people in their ranks. Most people that join it either leave or become inactive after a few years, whether from burnout or ideological development. To those that are disillusioned with PCP-JCP's revisionism, there's a real lack of anti-revisionist alternatives. The critique of PCP by FMR appears, then, as an accessible, readily available ideological position to be adopted and made into a political program.",

I agree with what you said and I think this means that we should differentiate between people who are leftcoms as in an inicial reaction to the general revisionism in the PCP, and those who are leftcoms for a longer period of time, and continue to be so even after coming to face with the flaws of left-communism.\n\n\nIn the comment before this one, you mentioned FMR being a former maoist. It is true, but I would be careful saying that since he made comments on Stalin that show his liberalism long before becoming a leftcom. He is one of those anti-Stalin maoists, sometimes called \"crypto trotskyists\". I don't think it is useful to claim him as a maoist (even if he saw himself as one). There was a piece by him which was critiqued here, I don't know if you have seen it:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/ywqtcd/the_cultural_revolution_and_the_end_of_maoism_by/\n\n\nAbout what you mentioned in regards to the CR, I agree and thanks for the contextualization in regards to the PCBR, I did not know what you mentioned in regards to the two organizations.

It seems that he changed a lot then. Now it makes sense that leftcoms hang on to his latter works more (specifically Anti-Dimitrov, from 1985, probably his most famous text). The part called \"notes on Stalin\" could have been written by the most staunch trotskyist:\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/portugues/rodrigues/1985/anti-dimitrov/stalin.htm\n\n\nHowever, one question must be asked: is it of any worth redeeming FMR's name and trying to rescue him from leftcoms? Like I said, I don't know his work properly but it seems that either his texts are the earlier ones which rightfully criticize revisionism, but don't, in my opinion, do in a particularly interesting way (basically we can find that criticism on Mao, Hoxha or Gonzalo), or are the latter works which are leftcom. I'm asking this because, if we should try to build a revolutionary history of Portugal, we probably need a \"symbol\" of a revolutionary of the past. The PCP (Peru) did that with Mari\u00e1tegui.\n\n\nI am a bit biased but I think we should rescue Otelo, even if he was an ultraleftist, because, for reasons known, he is still too scary for liberals. We must pick someone which has not been yet absorbed by liberalism (not that I think FMR has been, he is basically unknown other than in leftist circles). Besides that, Otelo was the leader of the 74 revolution, something that a revolutionary movement must rescue from liberalism. We must insist on Otelo as the maker of the revolution, say to the liberals: it wasn't Jaime Neves, it wasn't Sp\u00ednola, it wasn't even Salgueiro Maia; the man which ended fascism in Portugal was Otelo de Saraiva de Carvalho and he was a far-leftist and \"terrorist\" who killed.\n\n\n>I think that one thing effective in separating the \"wheat from the chaff\" is Palestine.\n\n\nAgree. It is the most important issue right now. Any liberal right now supporting Palestine is more of a friend of the people of the world than any \"both sides are bourgeois\" \"communist\".\n\n\nAlso thank you for the links about PCBR.",

A lot of liberals will declare themselves as being for the Palestinian people and yet, at the same time, they despise the people on the ground fighting for Palestine like Hamas, with the matrydom of Sinwar, a disgusting amount of liberals see his murder as a victory for ''peace'', that we just need to get rid of the ''hardliners'' on both sides; liberals also despise the foreign allies of Palestine like the DPRK.

I'm not talking about Joe Biden or career politicians, I'm talking about everyday liberals. The people I know which are liberals (I'm using liberal in a broad sense, it also includes social-democrats) do seem to be genuine in their empathy towards Palestine.\n\n\nBut even regarding career politicians, don't you think someone like Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is genuine in his empathy towards palestinians? I think he is and that he could definitely be doing way less that what he is doing right now. He could perhabs be doing more too, I agree.\n\n\nI disagree that we should prefer liberals not to engage with the movement at all. Historically, in important moments, mass movements (certainly, they were firstly build by the most radical and revolutionary elements of a society) have gotten so big that even some liberals became supportive of the movement. During the civil rights movement, during the anti-war movement about Vietnam, during the anti-apartheid movement, some liberals showed their support. Would these liberals care if not for the radicals to care first? Of course not. But still, I would say that their support was important somehow. We should of course struggle to prevent co-optation of the movement, and point to the liberals their hypocrisy, but I don't think that it would be beneficial to reject their support as a matter of principle. One thing is to be inflexible in our principles and to be very selective in who we allow into the Party or our organization, another thing is to be rigid and to reject alliances not taking into account the dynamics of a particular situation.\u00a0",

It would be dangerous and conspirational thinking to imagine that every liberal who is showing some sort of support is just faking it to look good to society. But they can only express their empathy throught an ideological and moral frame which doesn't go into contradiction with their class position and material interests, about that I agree with you. But the question is if that support which they originally show can or can not be used to purposes which go beyond their initial intentions.

The conflation between pre-war and post-war popular fronts (not to mention China) is a distortion of the former in my view and despite the fact that revisionism was already present in Dimitrov's formulation, reducing ulterior developments of revisionism to a repetition of the 'original sin' of the 7th congress of the CI is wrong analysis, as well as dangerous if the conclusion is the rejection of any and all 'popular fronts', in the sense of temporary class alliances that are made possible due to a particular situation. That FMR made a 180\u00b0 in his views on Stalin is probably an indicator of the weakness of his earlier theoretical conceptions in adequately explaining revisionism. But with that any capability of explaining the past, let alone the present, was definitely lost. Still, *Anti-Dimitrov* is situated in the middle of that transition and it's not entirely worthless to read it as it presents useful information about that period.",

If there was a modicum of internationalism left in China or Vietnam, they would\u2019ve sent workers over for free to help Cubans upgrade their plants to modern capacities. Was Cuba able to drag out this long due to the Latam Pink Wave, mostly Venuezela, which itself was ultimagely reliant upon the Chinese industrial experience? Now that Venuezela is in a crisis economically, it seems Cuba is not far behind. If somebody knows about whether the media is exaggerating and how does reality actually compares to the 90s.",
