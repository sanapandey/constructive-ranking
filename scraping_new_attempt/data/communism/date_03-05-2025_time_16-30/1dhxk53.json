    "selftext": "I've been thinking about the historical superpowers: the USSR, PRC, and USA. Two out of these three were led by communist parties, even though there are far fewer communist-led countries compared to non-communist ones. Does this indicates that being led by a communist party increases a country's chances of becoming a superpower? Where might my logic be flawed?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even regionally, they are surrounded by adversarial powers in India, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea in a way that past and current superpowers have never been.\n\nOn the economic side, China still has a smaller per capita GDP than Russia, and while their total economy is now bigger than the US, their per capita output is 6x smaller than the US. They are also still \"poorer\" than many of their regional rivals.",

None of those were especially free market economies, especially during their bit growth periods, they essentially had command economies with Zaibatsu or Chaebol or \"public private partnerships\" or \"window guidance\" that worked basically exactly the same way as 5 year plans interacting with soviet-style design bureaus and production units... Which I guess does show you can skin a cat in a variety of ways.\n\nThe main differentiators Id point out are A) relative size (only Japan is an actual major country on that list) and B) international assistance or at least acceptance. Singapore and HK are basically city states with very, very, very specific geographical and historical/political advantages that saw them accumulate capital quickly via access to foreign capital. SK is a client state built with hundreds of billions of foreign investment, grants, loans, and experts.\n\nYou mention China only grew after mao died... He died like 2 years before the US (and the world as a whole) actually recognized their government and stopped actively embargoing them. Similar to USSR; Soviet growth really took off during the great depression when they were FINALLY able to break into work markets and hire foreign experts like Albert Kahn. Even then they were still denied from open capital markets, having to trade entirely in commodities like grain or oil. No other countries have to deal with this stuff and still it was overcome.",
