    "selftext": "I'll admit that my curiosity was initially piqued by a video circulating in petty bourgeois left-liberal spaces, called [*Gacha Drama and the Korean Gender War*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Im4YAMWK74). I also watched the follow-up video. I found both videos unsatisfying, racist, and misogynistic. A few main points made that I recall was that South Korea's \"high context\" culture (apparently [nations which have \"low context\" cultures are exclusively imperialist, while nations with \"high context\" cultures are, for the most part, subjected to imperialism](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/76ulvh/eli5_highlow_context_cultures/)), \"collectivism\", a particularly reactionary interpretation of Confucianism (neo-Confucianism as the creator calls it), and not being subjected to 19th century Western imperialism were significant historical factors contributing to misogyny as we see it today. Confucianism is certainly reactionary and I can agree it still influences modern Korea, but the way the videos frame it as *the* historical foundation for misogyny in modern South Korea makes it seem like something about Koreans themselves or Asian-ness in general is inherently at fault. Of course, there is also a smug comment about the DPRK being built on the same Confucian principles with the Kim family being at the top of a \"hierarchy\" and the other usual slop like accusing it of \"authoritarianism.\" The creator also panders to misogynistic men by treating Megalian users \"fairly\" (accusing some of being \"misandrists\"). This even-handedness didn't exactly age well especially now that we know there are Telegram groups where Korean men share videos of them [molesting their family members](https://x.com/ssosohae1/status/1827538245321945464) and [deepfake child porn](https://x.com/dvu84djp/status/1828411317595648206). There were gestures to the chaebols (the name for Korean conglomerates from what I gathered), but again the creator doesn't blame capitalism as the root cause or even make a connection between how South Korean capitalism might use neo-Confucianism to justify its many workplace abuses, just neo-Confucianism.  Hopefully I've explained the videos well enough so that you don't have to watch them. \n\nThis led me to a dig a little deeper, and I found a moderately interesting [article](https://www.9dashline.com/article/understanding-antifeminist-backlash-in-the-south-korean-context-remnants-of-militarism-and-patriarchy). It's obviously not Marxist, but at least \"militarism\" and its relationship to patriarchy is something that we can begin to unpack. I don't really know where I should look to read more, though. I also don't know any Korean. Do I start with a history of the Korean War? I guess that would be the origin of the so-called militarism of South Korea. Any help and criticism is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I skimmed the videos again and I should mention the creator said that South Korean gamers like grindy games because they at least promise some reward. I guess we could talk about how labor aristocrats and the petty bourgeoisie enjoy video games because of the promise of unalienated labor?",

Korea was not isolated from the world prior to the Japanese conquest in the early 1900s. Actually, it was modernizing and the women's movement was at the center of social progress. So it makes sense the Japanese specifically targeted and eradicated feminists in their occupation. They made compradors of male Koreans who benefited under Japanese law and its modern legacy by identifying as staunch traditionalists. Although the Japanese army left, South Korea eventually became its unwilling peer as a US satrapy so disruptive social change has been barred, and modern revanchism has no pre-war memory.",
