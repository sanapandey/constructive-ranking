    "selftext": "I\u2019ve read guerrilla warfare by mao, and also studied it in other countries. The problem about the west though is that most of the people that would be sympathetic to the cause are the urban population. Almost of revolutions in the 20th centuries were in rural agrarian countries with vast areas of sparsely populated areas like how Cubans started in the sierra maestra or Vietnam and China. \n\nThe difference with the soviet revolution is they had the army on their side which I don\u2019t see happening, at least on a large scale, in America. Would guerrilla groups pull off urban infiltration? How would a group extricate themselves? How would they form bases of operation? It almost seems that Marx and Engels were incorrect and that mao was correct about less developed countries being the ones able to revolt. \n\nHow would urban combat work without being completely wiped? The only example I can think of is the IRA but I haven\u2019t read that book yet.\n\nEdit: mao said the guerillas must have the loyalty of the people and that they must be able to move in and out/ extricate themselves against a concentrated force but I don\u2019t see that being possible here in west",

            "body": "Aside from what everyone else has said to you, where you need to interrogate the nature of how you envision this conflict unfolding, one of the underlying theses of Mao's texts on guerilla warfare is not about Mao saying \"here's how to fight a war, everyone copy and paste these ideas forever\" but rather about flipping war on its head.  It is about Mao realizing the inherent contradictions with the ways that war was currently being fought, both in Europe and in China, and then using that understanding to fight the war in such an unorthodox and revolutionary manner as to refuse to give your opponents war on the terms that they want.  \n\nWhile both Chiang Kai-shek and Li De (Otto Braun) had brought with them the ideas for warfare from Europe to China, Chiang Kai-shek found relative success as he had European support and access to the supplies and resources and equipment comparable to European forces, like tanks and planes (if somewhat inferior).  Li De and the communists, on the other hand, found European tactics failing them because conditions in China were not comparable to the USSR or Europe (fortifications had to be made of wood instead of concrete, flintlock rifles had to be used in place of machine guns, etc).  Part of how Mao was able to rise to prominence was by understanding that these tactics were the exact terms of engagement that Chiang Kai-shek (as well as Imperial Japan) was both prepared for and hoping to leverage with his superior resources and relative position of power, and instead Mao's strategies were predicated on fighting the war in the way that negated all of Chiang Kai-shek's preparations and advantages, and instead frustrate every attempt to do battle on those terms. Mao's forces had little equipment, which meant that they were fast and light and mobile, while Chiang Kai-shek's vast supply of resources slowed his army down and presented opportune targets.   Thus, the logic was to turn all of the supposed disadvantages of the communists into advantages, and all of the enemy advantages into their disadvantages. \n\nI think this is the revolutionary impetus that needs to be considered -- not to pretend that learning how to use a gun isn't important, but I don't think communists will benefit solely by trying to get better at airsoft combat than fascists, who already dominate the hobby and could probably outcompete the relatively small number of Western communists even if the numbers disadvantage is ignored, at least within the terms of airsoft warfare.  Instead, modern communists need to take a revolutionary approach to warfare, and reconsider how to fight or kill fascists or the imperialist state while denying them their capacity to fight the very type of war that they have been preparing for and would prefer to fight, and instead make them fight on terms unknown/unclear/unthinkable to them.",

I was thinking of that same thing in a way. But we do need more context in how we get there, how it goes down and we need to do a lot more agitation before that I\u2019m just thinking about it after reading about the Cuban, Russian, and Chinese revolutions. \n\nAs a side note I hate democrat libs that always say to conservatives \u201cyOU tHanK you CaN taKe oN the AIrForCe and tANks? \n\nYes possibly, it\u2019s true that the American government has bombed its own people before but to do it now? I think the backlash would just crazy because of civilian death toll. No I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna take a Tank down with an AR-15 but shit if people in Afghanistan can do it I\u2019m sure people in America could (in Roblox) make IEDs and other explosives. \n\nAs another side note, Chinese got lots of weapons from the USSR as did Korea and Vietnam. Don\u2019t remember if Cuba did at first but the thing is I don\u2019t know if China would fill that role. They used too for sure, but I don\u2019t see them arming a mass rebellion in America until their power at the very least outmatches americas, which doesn\u2019t seem to far away honestly.\nBut even then they\u2019d be condemned by the west just as they are now in the Ukraine war even though they aren\u2019t even arming the Russians.\n\nTypical west",

Even then, the presumptions are uninteresting. The size of national liberation movements is not something that can be predicted. It also has nothing to do with \"feasibility\" but the necessary logic of revolution as the liberation of oppressed peoples. The US is a prison house of nations, \"breaking away\" is a basic misunderstanding of what is being discussed. \n\n>then what ARE you trying to say?\n\nI was speaking to people who are already familiar with the foundational works of Marxism-Leninism because this is r/communism. I'm not really interested in explaining the basic Leninist position on Bundism, I want to apply it to Turtle Island. I was doing that with the OP and your intrusion is a distraction",

It\u2019s so cringe and performative and it\u2019s why people don\u2019t like internet communists\n\n\nAlso this has deviated so much from what I initially asked which you never gave answers too only insulting my own intelligence as Marxist Leninist. You can have your internet points I really don\u2019t give a fuck if a bunch of online nerds that don\u2019t do shit think. \n\nAnd the fact you thought I didn\u2019t know the south was home to the largest black population?? Like you\u2019re just assuming, *why not ask??* it\u2019s been obvious since after the civil war and the socialist party of America in the early 1900\u2019s wanted to have black power in the south\n\nWe need actualization of change now. I work in the Party of Socialism and Liberation and work with housing issues here in Nashville, what do you do but post online? Sorry if that\u2019s mean but you\u2019ve been nothing but rude so I want to know what work do you do besides posting online and yet calling me a \u201cReddit socialist\u201d I guarantee I\u2019ve read just as much communist literature as you although you do seem to post more about American centric radical history which I should honestly know more about. But as it stands we are far from having the masses on our side.",

How would a Marxist give a clear cut definition of suburban vs rural? I know in TX for example, hardly a fraction of the population works in farming or ranching.\n\nI will admit that I do live in a segregated bubble just like y'all where most people I've interacted with have been white people. From my experience, being \"country\" is just another consumptive identity in the whole supermarket of identities to pick from for white suburbanites/exurbanites. I have noticed that the majority of people I know that identify with this label are blue collar whites (construction, truck driving, etc). There are some white collar whites that identify with this too, but this is definitely rarer since a large chunk of em are transplants. The common thread it seems to me is that this \"country\" identity is a way for \"native\" white Texans to differentiate themselves. Some transplants will adopt this identity too, but I've found it to be rare because of the negative stereotypes that exist about the region (like OP's impression of Tennessee). This seems to be changing though with the increasing popularity of country music recently (look at Beyonce's or Post Malone's transition into country recently).\n\nWith this being the white view of rurality, I'm left to wonder how it is for black people. I worked in a factory in a rural county in TX with a large concentration of black people recently, but it seemed like my workplace had a preference for hiring illegal immigrants from other third world countries instead. I know that there are large concentrations of black people across the rural black belt from eastern TX to Virginia/Maryland/Delaware and that people characterize em as lumpen (?), but I figure that I need a deeper understanding of how they fit in the economic structure of the US.\n\nAlso a question that came up while I was writing this: going back to the example of the factory that I worked at, are there any contradictions between black workers and illegal workers? Hiring black workers might be more expensive for companies than illegal workers since they get the benefits of citizenship. Is this what Trump was talking about when he mentioned that \"illegals are stealing black jobs\" during the debate? This would make sense to me because black workers have often been at the lowest strata of American society, the workplace, the factory floor, etc. This is me speculating though I need y'all's comments on this.",

Post even said his idea for the song came from getting braids and thinking of himself as a white Allen Iverson. This is obviously rich for digging into the 2010's petty bourgeoise white obsession with rap music and black aesthetic. He was able to garner so many white fans while simultaneously being [overtly racist](https://kollegekidd.com/news/post-malone-reacts-to-lil-b-calling-him-a-culture-vulture-says-his-white-skin-color-is-being-used-against-him/) because it was in vogue (the irony of Lil B foreshadowing him going back to country) to be racist from a distance for white young people (OP of this post, for example). Now, with rap being so oversaturated, Post has gone back to what he originally wanted to make - garbage 'country.' Of course, he was never talented but as a reflection of a particular American consumer, he is really useful. I don't think it's a coincidence that he has made this transition immediately after [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7bQwwqW-Hc) became immensely popular.\n\nNot that this tangent is super related to your questions, but it just made me think about how the stereotypes are repackaged in American culture.",

I know Russians were generally considered non white at times but before the revolution it was definitely a Russian dominated society in the empire and many MANY Russians were apart of the revolution.

But I guess if you\u2019re specifically talking about Western Europe and the Anglo sphere idk maybe it\u2019s not, but I\u2019ve seen lots of white comrades, and others that aren\u2019t exactly there yet but if they had the right push and education could def become comrades. I hate to say it but their just isn\u2019t enough natives to fight, and if any working class group has been most resistant, at least to unionizing (in my experience) has been Asians and Latin-Americans.

It's bad. Besides the fact that it plagiarizes the exact same analysis in Thomas Lamarre's *The Anime Machine* without attribution, \"cuck philosophy\" seems to have no knowledge of Japanese history or culture. He ends up reproducing the most vulgar, fascist understanding of Shintoism, unsurprising since he is uncritically presenting the fascist thought of Heidegger as correct or at minimum interesting on its own terms. Worse, he removes the most interesting aspect of Lamarre's analysis, which is the aesthetics of Miyazaki's films as at the cusp of a neoliberal relation to the commodity even while Miyazaki himself seems to resist this tendency in his own work (and yet Ghibli is fine with endless merchandise). Basically it's the typical vulgar reading of plot elements that presents them as \"deep\" by pairing them with a philosopher whose writing is incomprehensible. But in this case, not only is he plagiarizing and making everything worse, in his ignorance he ends up promoting fascism. Why would anyone look to this person for opinions on Marxism or communism? \n\nObviously one does not need to watch anything to know a guy named \"cuck philosophy\" might have some affinities with fascism and produce bad analysis. Still, u/urbaseddad you'll appreciate this comment for the video\n\n>While listening to your points about Shinto it finally clicked for me why my last trip to Greece was so memorable. I was there with a few friends of mine and we explored the area around Corinth. Opposite of our apartment's living room window we could see a mountain with a cloister on it. So, one day we decided to drive up there and visit it. I'm not christian or religious in any way but I can't deny the presence of the small chapel and crypt. Especially the latter had a divine quality. It felt like a place in our physical realm that was connected to something else, something more. Talking to the nuns there, they revealed it's history and culture. This was not an abstract idea of god and the heavens but a very tangible place that had significance because of it's connection to where it was built on and the people that inhabitated it.\n\nThe joke being that Corinth is the worst possible example of some transhistorical connection to spirituality because it was totally destroyed multiple times by earthquakes and fires and is entirely a new city. But basic historical facts are not important to postmodern mumbo jumbo smuggled into modernity through fascist mysticism. Honestly I just feel bad for his audience who are desperate for knowledge but can't make even the first step when grifters are constantly tugging at their eyeballs.\n\nE: ok I skimmed it. We can get into all the incorrect claims, snide remarks, and lazy analyses but there's no point, the fundamental concept is bad. It's not an analysis of the logic of the urban guerrilla. The self-justifications of urban guerrillas are never actually presented nor is the analysis of communist parties mentioned in the videos explaining their own actions interrogated. I doubt \"cuck philosophy\" read any of the books mentioned as sources beyond skimming since, for example, Marighella's work is not actually referenced. Instead it is Che Guevara and Foco without any references showing this connection actually existed outside the mind of \"cuck philosophy.\"\n\nIt's just a polemic against the very concept, lazily grouping together radically different historical experiences and social forces. You would learn the same information from wikipedia without the obnoxious narrator.",

Whether there was some study of the Tupamaros I'm also not sure since the amount of empirical research to make this claim is far beyond the value of the effort (obviously\"cuck philosophy\" does not even try). The problem is we're getting caught in the conceptual apparatus of the video by thinking about \"urban guerillas\" when that is precisely the vulgar term that must be rejected to study each movement on its own terms. While I agree with you that ultimately the theory of PPW makes all of these ideas superfluous but there is still something to learn from the practice of the more important anti-revisionist but not Maoist parties of post-war Europe.\n\nWhat I was trying to say on my post is that for some of the movements, the experience of the Tupamaros probably did have some influence whereas Cuba had none. The video sees this as a weakness, implying all of these groups were too stupid and idealistic to realize the Cuban experience didn't apply to them. But the idea that they were mimicking the Cuban experience is never proved in the first place, whereas the actual success of the Tupamaros is blown off as an exception. If your theory has exceptions then it is not a theory.\n\n>do you think there is a qualitative difference between Foco as practiced by M-26-7 and the ERP and the urban based strategies attempted by ALN, the Tupamaros, PIRA, FALN, RAF\n\nFoco basically says one thing: sometimes a revolution can be made through action. This was only really important in relation to the Popular Socialist Party and the larger Soviet revisionist theory of the productive forces which would never make a revolution. To those of us who already reject Soviet revisionism, it has nothing to say and is too vague to ever be applied usefully (and has only been applied disastrously, making Soviet revisionism superficially appealing again). On the other hand, the engagement with questions of strategy and the larger shift in global imperialism in Europe is still relevant . We're still unpacking the experience of the KAK in Denmark whereas nobody is trying to repeat the July 26th movement outside of the fantasies of Dengists like \"cuck philosophy\" who need an imagined antagonist to justify reformism and ngo politics.",
