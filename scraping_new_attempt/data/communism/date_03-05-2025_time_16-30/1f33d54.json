    "selftext": "In a recent post regarding the \u201cinevitability\u201d of communism I had a discussion with u/CoconutCrab115 about nuclear war and whether it could end life on earth and humanity and they recommended that I make a post about it to open the discussion which I do now.\n\nAs I have researched this subject I have come to the conclusion that forwarding the position that nuclear war should be unthinkable and would end humanity or civilization completely is reactionary in substance and should be avoided.\n\nFirst I point out that the most modern scientific theories heavily indicate that nuclear war could not kill all life on Earth or even drive humanity to extinction. As I mentioned in the previous discussion \u201cEven the complete destruction of human civilization is almost impossible, and this was true even during the nuclear peak of the 1980s as the nuclear winter hypothesis has been proven to be incorrect and cobalt nuclear weapons have never been manufactured as the concept itself is irrational (it's the premise of Dr. Strangelove). For comparison the Chicxulub impactor, connected with the extinction of the dinosaurs, corresponds to at least 70,000,000 Mt of energy, which is roughly 7000 times the combined maximum arsenal of the US and Soviet Union during the nuclear peak (wikipedia).\u201d\n\nBut as research shows, this is not just a matter of nuclear physics or climatology but a question of line that has separated the wheat from the chaff regarding revisionism historically. User u/CoconutCrab115 mentioned a right deviationist tendency and a left adventurist tendency and although the right deviationist tendency is very clearly delineated throughout history I have not seen evidence of a significant left adventurist tendency.\n\nWhat is very clear is that all great leaders and thinkers of scientific communism that have written about this subject have been resolute in their opinion that the threat of nuclear war cannot be used as justification for reformism or backing down in the face of imperialist aggression.\n\nFearmongering about nuclear war as an end to all things can be a sign of latent liberalism or possible revisionism as it exposes anxiety about the wrecking of the imperialist world order. This is something the media monopolies and the scientific establishment have attempted to inculcate among the people as an example as to why an alternative to the current state of things cannot exist.\n\nThe two greatest revolutions in history have after all been successful after world wars, heavily determined by the chaotic conditions it created in the respective countries so it stands to reason that after a hypothetical WW3, with most imperialist urban centers pulverized and the entire imperialist system thrown into complete chaos worldwide the conditions for the ignition of revolution on an unprecedented level would be perfect. Mao, Che and Gonzalo have written about precisely this as I have appended below:\n\n\u00a0\n\nMao Zedong\u2019s Speech at the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers\u2019 Parties \u2013 1957\n\n>But now we have to take into consideration the circumstance, that there is rabid militarism, and it plays with atomic and hydrogen bombs. They are playing, and we are also playing. In this case, one could deliver a destructive blow at one another, and, of course, there inevitably would be human loss. **We should also base ourselves on the fact that one must always take into account the worst-case scenario**.\n\n>Our party\u2019s Politburo called meetings several times, which repeatedly discussed this question that if they start a war now, well, then, we don\u2019t have atomic bomb, we just have grenades. But one should take into account that we have a head, and as for the atomic bomb, we can say that it is in the possession of our elder brother, the Soviet Union.\n\n>Can one estimate how many people would be lost in a future war? Possibly, it would be one third of the whole world\u2019s population of 2700 million, or just 900 million people. I think this is even too few if the atomic bomb are really dropped\\*\\*. Of course, this is very scary. But it would not be that bad even if it were a half. Why? Because we did not want it, and they are imposing a war on us. If we go to war, atomic and hydrogen weapons will be used\\*\\*. I personally think that the entire world will suffer, if a half of the human kind, or more than a half, die. I argued this question with Nehru. He is more pessimistic than I in this respect. **I told him: if half of the human kind is destroyed, the other half will still remain, but imperialism will be destroyed completely, and there will just be socialism in the entire world, and in half-a-century or a whole century the population will grow again, even by more than a half**.\n\n>In China, construction has not yet fully unfolded. If the imperialists impose war on us, we\u2019ll be read to stop construction. First, let\u2019s try \\[our\\] forces. Later, we can return to construction. We think that there is nothing bad for us in fearing war every day. Well, then, maybe I\u2019ll be able to pass on this apprehension to you. \n\n  \nChe Guevara - Tactics and Strategy of the Latin American Revolution - 1962\n\n>The most submissive countries and consequently, the most cynical, talk about the threat of Cuban subversion, and they are right. The greatest threat of the Cuban revolution is its own example, its revolutionary ideas, the fact that the government has been able to increase the combativity of the people, led by a leader of world stature, to heights seldom equaled in history. **Here is the electrifying example of a people prepared to suffer nuclear immolation so that its ashes may serve as a foundation for new societies. When an agreement was reached by which the atomic missiles were removed, without asking our people, we were not relieved or thankful for the truce; instead we denounced the move with our own voice. We have demonstrated our firm stand, our own position, our decision to fight, even if alone, against all dangers and against the atomic menace of Yankee imperialism.**\n\n>Will imperialism continue to lose one position after another or will it, in tis bestiality and as it threatened not long ago, launch a nuclear attack and burn the entire world in an atomic holocaust? We cannot say. **We do assert, however, that we must follow the road of liberation even though it may cost millions of atomic war victims. In the struggle to death between two systems we cannot think of anything but the final victory of socialism or its relapse as a consequence of the nuclear victory of\u00a0 imperalist agression.**\n\n>Cuba is at the brink of an invasion, threatened by the most powerful imperialist forces of the owrld, and as such, threatened with atomic death. From its trench, refusing to retreat, Cuba issues a call to arms to all of Latin America. This is a struggle that will not be decided in a few minutes or in a hour of terrible battle. **The end of the stuggle will take years of bitter encounters causing atrocious suffering. The attack of the allied imperialist and bourgeois forces will time and again force the popular movements to the brink of destruction, but those movements will always come back strenghened by the support of the people until total liberation is achieved**. \n\n\u00a0Interview with Chairman Gonzalo \u2013 El Diario \u2013 1988\n\n>The European powers are obviously in the line of fire of both superpowers, and if there is a world war, they would like to prevent it from taking place in Europe. That's what they want, because at bottom they are eager, as is Japan, that the two tigers fight each other so that later one of them can emerge as a great power, as the supreme ruler. Such are the dreams of Japan, West Germany, etc. But a world war would also be waged in Europe, and the two superpowers are very aware of the Europeans' desires. So the situation creates contradictions among the powers and the superpowers, which unfold as a complex process involving collusion and contention. It could not be otherwise. How these powers fight to fulfill their dreams is also evident: Japan for dominance over Asia and South America, Europe over Africa and Latin America. And they don't restrict themselves to these regions, hence their bustling about and mediations, their separate and conflicting policies, because they each defend their own interests.\n\n>We believe that these are all demagogic debates that only serve to conceal big plans involving contention for world hegemony. That is what we believe, because imperialism will not cease to exist until we sweep it away. Its essence won't change--its essence is to exploit and oppress, to reduce nations to the state of semi-colonies and, if possible, to colonies. While I'm on the subject, it's high time that we go back to using these terms, because they are terms scientifically established by Lenin. But the point is that in the face of these plans the main thing is not simply exposing them, but getting prepared to take them on. And there is but one way to prepare, and that is by means of people's war\\*\\*. Chairman Mao said: we have to prepare ourselves and prepare ourselves right now against an imperialist war, and principally against a nuclear war. How will we respond? Only with people's war, in no other way\\*\\*. That is the most important thing. Exposing them is part of carrying out a propaganda campaign that shows the world their sinister and hideous plans for mass genocide. **But this will never stop a war, as Stalin dearly stated. These campaigns never stop wars, so the only thing to do if we want to prevent war, is to develop revolution. As the Chairman taught us: either revolution will prevent world war, or world war will give rise to revolution. This, I believe, is how we should view the situation.**\n\n>(Later talking about Gorbachev) What else does this individual put forward? He is developing Khrushchev's positions\\*\\*. Let's look at the question of war. He says that a world war will lead to the disappearance of humanity. In his own words, \"In this war there will be neither victor nor vanquished. There will be no survivors,\" \"If a nuclear war breaks out all living things will be obliterated from the face of the earth.\" And, \"In a global nuclear conflict there will be neither winners nor losers, world civilization will inevitably perish.\"\\*\\* But what does he add? Allow me to read, \"Politics must be based on realities. And today the most formidable world reality is the vast military arsenals, conventional as well as nuclear, of the United States and the Soviet Union. This gives our two countries a special responsibility in relationship to the whole world.\" **What is this? Unabashedly he is telling us that his might is based on military superiority, and he brandishes it alongside the military power of Yankee imperialism, clamoring that they are all that matters in the world, and as a result, we are dependent on them**. This is what he espouses, the most shameless, blatant superpower politics that we have seen. But according to him, it is not only a nuclear war that puts humanity at risk, but conventional war as well: given the sophisticated and deadly weapons that exist today, it could bring the same results\\*\\*. Thus Gorbachev tries to impose on us the most monstrous policy of subjugation. Faced with this, we raise even higher Chairman Mao Tsetung's banner, \"It's right to rebel.\"\\*\\* \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe threat of nuclear war has obviously not abated and perhaps has even increased since the collapse of the Soviet Union with the multiplication of nuclear armed states, more precision in nuclear capabilities and greater instability among imperialist powers. We should not be dissuaded by liberal accusations of madness or support for mass genocide as it is clear that communists should not support nuclear war but recognize it as a near inevitability with the further degradation of the imperialist world system and perhaps the greatest opportunity for world revolution.\n\nIf you know of anymore writings on the subject by communist leaders perhaps by members of the CPP or CPI(Maoist) post them below, please.",

            "body": "This is such weird timing. I also JUST read the original thread (few hours before you posted) you referred to and looked into Mao's writings on nuclear war, because the quote from Mao about imperialism being destroyed after half of humanity dies seemed crazy to me. It made more sense to me after reading more on it in the context it was said.\n\nStill, I was confused. Mao and other socialist leaders clearly state that they are opposed to nuclear war waged by imperialist states and that we should be afraid of the mass slaughter that it will cause. But at the same time they talk about the possibilities that arise from said war. So is the line on of opposition to war or not? Or am I posing this false dichotomy based on an incomplete understanding?\n\nBut Gonzalo's thoughts on this which you included in your post definitely clear up a lot of things for me. I know that I am approaching this topic in a weird confused way, I just don't know how exactly it is wrong. Any criticism is appreciated.",

                    "body": "The line is always one of opposition to inter-imperialist war but as Mao and Gonzalo point out this does not stop the war only the final victory of socialism could stop it entirely. It is not different than a conventional inter-imperialist war, for example, when WW1 started Lenin became distinguished because he was the only great leader to not only oppose the war on internationalist grounds but also to forward the position that every communist in every imperialist country involved should support defeatism as it would create optimal conditions for revolutionary activities. \n\nBy extrapolating this on a world scale in modern conditions the position is clear, nuclear war should always be opposed because of the immense tragedy it would cause, perhaps unprecedented in history, but since in the absence of revolution inter-imperialist war is inevitable communists should support the complete defeat of imperialism in this war to create the conditions for revolution from it's ashes. \n\nThat nuclear war would be a great and unprecedented tragedy is clear to all people what must be opposed is the catastrophism to claim that this would result in the complete extinction of humanity or it's \"regression\" back into previous modes of production. Beyond being unsupported by modern scientific theories which clearly indicate that humanity is not capable of complete self-destruction these theories are undialectic and showcase latent liberalism and revisionism. It's no surprise that all Soviet revisionist leaders espoused them, it was one of the main justifications for the peaceful coexistence doctrine and later Gorbachev's complete capitulation to US imperialism. \n\nRevolution or resistance to imperialism cannot be dissuaded by nuclear blackmail, Che was correct to denounce the revisionist Soviet Union for capitulation in 1962 just as North Korea is correct today to not back down and keep developing nuclear weapons in the face of imperialist aggression.",

The position against the war both before and during was very clearly a position against it from all upholding the proletarian position.\n\nSo the position is the same. We oppose the imperialist preparations to war. We oppose the world war if it comes. But if it comes we will turn it into a war against the imperialists.\n\nBoth the previous world wars are remembered for their huge advances for the communists and the world revolution. But we and history hold the imperialists responsible for the destruction these wars have caused to humanity.\n\nImperialist war, including world wars are a fact of the world irregardless of our own wills. And its signifance in a world revolution can of course not be understated. This does not make us wish for the world war or its carnage. We are always opposed to war. And if war arises revolution is the best weapon against it.\n\nIf the imperialists start a third world war, it will end not with the victory of any imperialist power. But the revolution will be its end. So looking into the possibilities of this is not cynical \"accelerationism\" or anything. It is looking into the only way to end such a war.
