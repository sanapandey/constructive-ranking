    "selftext": "If you look at their history. Manifest Destiny, Treatment of Natives, Slavery, Segregation. Moreover, their crazy imperialistic history. Their involvment in establishing fascist regimes all over the world. The fact that the two party system of the US is a de facto one party system-especially if you consider that the democrats are basically the \"liberal\" wing of the republicans.  It also has to be considered that the president of the US concentrates more power in himself than most if not all leaders of all other liberal \"democracies\".\n\nMoreover, their insane focus on patriotism and nationalism. Flags, Chants, Symbols, Anthems. \n\nThey always have a designated group of hate they have to focus their inhabitants on. After WW2 it were the communists (and pretty sure many minority groups here and then when it was convinient) and after the collapse of the soviet union it became Islam.\n\nThen we have the massive power given to the police. The heavy involvment of religion in politics and everyday life and the way politicans fund their campagne (rich people and companies pay them literally millions).\n\nWe cannot forget the massive funding in militairy and the lack of social fundings which is pretty much they since at least WW2. \n\nWould it be correct to say that the US is fascist. It shares some crazy similarities imo.",

And I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily useful to expand the notion of fascism to include everything you\u2019ve said here. I think fascism is a particular historical formation that emerged as a reaction to economic crisis in Europe, which took advantage of particular social anxieties to take power. I think fascism is characteristically a reaction to the failure of liberal democracy to manage industrial capitalism. It employs strategies like the facilitation of a hero culture and the promise that the enemy is from within and is both so strong that it poses and existential threat, but so weak that we can easily defeat them. \n\nMoreover, we already have other terms to describe the kinds of evils that America has committed and I think our terminology should be used to make finer distinctions when possible. I think that actually helps us with critical analysis.",

But as with all things, if we are thinking dialectically, one thing contains the seed of another thing that develops as a result of it, and you can see a continuity through history.\n\nAll that said, I do think it can be useful to point out the proto-fascistic character of a lot of American colonial liberalism, if only to combat the positive associations with it that the American education system ingrains in people. Whether or not it's literally fascism, it's ugly for the same reasons and exhibits the same tendencies of the ruling class to use any and all forms of violence to maintain its supremacy.",

White supremacy and nationalism are not intrinsically fascist, it's the other way around. \n\nMore than anything, fascism was a response by the international dominant class to the threat of communism, and the US ruling class during its formative years was way more worried about slave insurrections like the one in Haiti than with the then-abstract idea of a marxist revolution. That all changed after the Soviets, and the US to this day is defined by their reaction to that change.",
