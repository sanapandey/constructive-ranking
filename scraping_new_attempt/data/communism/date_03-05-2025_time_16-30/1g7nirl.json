You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The issue is brain drain and the social consequences of imperialism that are disguised by a fantasy of freedom to travel. North Korea is absolutely right to expect its citizens to contribute to the nation after providing them free education, healthcare, housing, military protection, and work, that is what citizenship meant before neoliberalism.",

Reddit liberals had dug up a video of some teenagers being sentenced to community service for importing k-dramas into the DPRK.  Liberals made a reaction thread, and then brought it to the Dengists of debatecommunism to get reaction to the \"\"injustice,\"\" and all of the \"pro-DPRK\" Dengists could only reply \"fake news!\"  And all the answers in the thread were basically that, in one form or another.  None of them could actually accept, let alone defend the logic of importing cultural imperialism to be a crime, and none of them wanted to defend DPRK on the actual terms of anti-imperialism and socialism. \n\nI used to think that this sort of thing was at least tolerable, since they were \"defending\" DPRK after all, against a relentless propaganda onslaught from reddit fascists.  But I've come to realize that this sort of behavior is not an adequate defense; it's harmful to communism, and it's ultimately harmful to the DPRK as well.\n\nedit: Similarly, there was another similar thread about executing the Romanovs in debatecommunism as well a couple months back.  Instead of the top answer explaining that it was a correct strategic decision, or making the case that it was justified or it was actually saving lives, the number one answer by dozens of upvotes was \"they panicked.\"  They've already ceded to liberalism that killing the Romanovs was wrong (it was not), and instead are trying to retroactively apologize for this supposed error made by the Bolsheviks rather than uphold a completely correct decision within the history of communism which makes liberals uncomfortable (which is not a bad thing, but a good thing).  And Yakov Sverdlov, one of the most brilliant Bolsheviks with an intellect to match Lenin, is reduced to being a panicky fool, and his most consequential directive isn't upheld, but condemned by supposed \"communists.\"",
