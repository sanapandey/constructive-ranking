You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I just recently caught wind of this a few days ago although the event seems to have taken place back in January. A few members of the ACP have been leaving recently, including Danny Shaw of Midwestern Marx. The reaction has been pretty much what you\u2019d expect on the S4A channel where it was also highlighted (i.e. any \u201canalysis\u201d reduced to psyop jokes like \u201cAmerican CIA Party\u201d in the comments section.).\n\nShaw wrote several posts about his experience, which are also equally lacking in any class analysis. [This one in particular](https://www.profdannyshaw.com/the-haz-al-din-acp-cult-through-the-lens-of-traumatizing-narcissism/) devolves into posting Deviant Art-esque images on narcissism and that basically Haz was very mean and yelled a lot:\u00a0\n\n>Even in my easily mockable failure, I never stopped being a patriot and anti-imperialist. In fact, this was the silver lining in this entire ordeal. I learned that the American flag of Bezos, Trump and Musk is not the American flag of the people of Ohio, Texas and the rest of this land. I saw what I thought was a unique communist project to train and centralize the terminally-online, post-COVID era youth.\n\nSo basically Settler joins Settler party and is surprised.\u00a0\n\nThis all goes without saying, (though perhaps worth reiterating as [CPUSA members crawl through here again](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1j168ve/how_do_you_keep_up_with_current_events_what/)), but the ACP is probably the purest distillation we have of an Amerikan \u201cCommunist\u201d party and the logical end goal of settler politics. Whether ACP really did \"break off\" from CPUSA, the members of the latter cannot deny how extremely clear their Party has already made stance on the settler-colonialism contradiction. They\u2019ve even had [official posts on their site](https://www.cpusa.org/article/whats-at-stake-in-the-settler-colonial-debate/) that have [also been cross-posted on Midwestern Marx](https://www.midwesternmarx.com/articles/whats-at-stake-in-the-settler-colonial-debate-by-albert-bender). Of course it reads like they just browsed the Wikipedia:\n\n>In the book\u00a0*Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat*, J. Sakai states that \u201cthe white proletariat cannot be revolutionary because they are settlers.\u201d This statement reveals the author\u2019s bias against working-class unity and plays into the hands of the ruling class. White workers are obviously not settlers but a part of the working class and natural allies of the nationally and racially oppressed. To regard them as \u201csettlers\u201d would be a blow against the struggle for unity and would only prolong capitalism.\n\nE: I just realized how even more disingenuous that CPUSA article is in that those quotes are used as if Sakai actually said that verbatim, which of course, he does not say anything in that exact phrasing throughout the entirety of *Settlers*.",

Sam Marcy argues they were negligible while defending the revisionist USSR.\n\n> It is true that there is a certain amount of \u201cunemployment,\u201d which some pro-Chinese theoreticians claim to be the indubitable proof that capitalism has, in fact, been restored. But this is the kind of unforgivable exaggeration which no serious capitalist economist, however full of hatred for the Soviet Union, has yet been able to make. The \u201cunemployment\u201d that exists in the USSR results from technological changeovers and the inefficiency of the bureaucracy in finding new employment, but the reality of the situation is that there is a labor shortage in the Soviet Union, the very reverse of what these theoreticians are trying to prove. The world capitalist economic crisis has, of course, affected all socialist countries, including China. But these stresses are the results of external influences from the world capitalist market and do not arise out of the internal dynamics of socialist construction.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/marcy/1977-ussr/02.htm\n\nBut Marcy himself is suspect. I\u2019m mostly trying to determine whether Kosygin was the final restoration of capitalism and if we can observe its immanent laws in the USSR prior to 1989.",

The Mao speech you linked is really helping me understand some basic laws of nature, thank you for that.\n\nMy question is inspired by this thread I saw (https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/29tkq3/reason\\_in\\_revolt\\_marxist\\_philosophy\\_and\\_modern/) where JMP claims that dialectics do not apply to the natural sciences. While I am not at all partial to JMP or Ted Grant, seeing as Engels never edited his findings into a cohesive manuscript to my knowledge I really do wish there were at least some debate on the work I could find to help me better understand applying the dialectical method to nature as well as the accuracy of Engels' conclusions, which I've heard in a few places were historically limited not unlike *The Origins of the Family* was. (And yes, the irony of me needing a study guide for what are essentially a collection of study notes is not lost on me)\n\n>(My recollection is that this translation is quite poor in some places though.)\n\nMy monolingual-ness will forever be my most immediate area of shame.",

I didn't see it at the time. So you're interested in a Marxist critique of Chomskyan linguistics? I'd appreciate any readings you could share. Now that I think of it, have you read Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ea3o\u2019s *Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness*?\n\n\nI skimmed the JMP comments you linked.\n\n\n>marxists thinking that being marxists qualifies them as authorities to speak about physics, biology, etc.\n\n\nIt should be the opposite. As Engels put it in *Dialectics of Nature*,\n\n\n>It is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. ... The mistake lies in the fact that these laws are foisted on nature and history as laws of thought, and not deduced from them.\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch02.htm\n\n\nJMP is not wrong that cranks like Glenn Borchardt exist (I read a bit of the latter\u2019s work and it was a pretty bizarre juxtaposition. He raises a lot of the right questions and uses a lot of concepts from Marxist philosophy, but he's eclectic and misinterprets those concepts and the answers he gives to his own good questions are anticlimactically vacuous. And he believes in \"faith\" lol.). I am all for a critical reappraisal of the conclusions of the communist scientists of the past\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1hp9cmo/comment/m4l9l4o/\n\n\nbut JMP goes to an extreme in renouncing much of the heritage of Marxism.\n\n\nAt the moment, my focus is on clarifying my understanding of the philosophical category of matter (and more generally the basic question of philosophy) in the light of both the history of philosophy and the conclusions of modern natural science.\n\n\nAs for the Sakata talk I linked, I took a look at it and right from the beginning there's a big error in the translation that totally distorts Mao's meaning.\n\n\nWhere it says\n\n\n>Sakata says that basic particles are indivisible while electrons are divisible.\n\n\nMao actually said\n\n\n>Sakata says that basic particles are **not** indivisible, that electrons are divisible.\n\n\nI remember there being other errors like that further along in the text.",

I plan to tackle *The Prison House of Language* in the near-ish future, have you read that one?\n\n>Now that I think of it, have you read Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ea3o\u2019s *Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness*?\n\nI've never read French philosophy before in my life.

Does anything come off as idealistic in his work?\n\n>Would you mind expanding on this?\n\nI couldn't before I understand what *matter* even is. I will say however that after reading this note from *Physics*:\n\n>Impact and friction. Mechanics regards the effect of impact as taking place in a pure form. But in reality things are different. On every impact part of the mechanical motion is transformed into heat, and friction is nothing more than a form of impact that continually converts mechanical motion into heat (fire by friction known from primeval times).\n\nI'm wondering if I should also consider titration as taking place in an ideal form? With no consideration for potential changes in viscosity as well as temperature even before the pH changes and assume that there is only potential energy? I think I need to read more on mathematics to comment on equilibrium states. I'm definitely exceeding my limits here and I'm not sure if I'm being coherent.",

Allow me to correct myself: A dialectical materialist approach to a language demands that we not limit our view of it to an abstract, reified version. As Stalin said,\n\n\n>the chief task of linguistics is to study the inherent laws of language development\n\n\nIf we deal only with an abstract reification, we rob ourselves of any possibility of doing this. Although\n\n\n>The chief thing in a language is its grammatical system and basic word stock\n\n\nwhich are relatively stable over long periods of time,\n\n\n>language ... is in a state of almost constant change\n\n\nThis fluidity of language as a developing process must be emphasized. I am not saying that\n\n\n>national language is a fiction.\n\n\nNational languages have actually been reified in the course of the historical process. Nevertheless,\n\n\n>The constancy of all processes is relative, but the mutability manifested in the transformation of one process into another is absolute.\n\n\nOne divides into two. Just as importantly,\n\n\n>language and its laws of development can be understood only if studied in inseparable connection with the history of society, with the history of the people to whom the language under study belongs, and who are its creators and repositories.\n\n\nAs such, we should view language as a battlefield of class struggle and point out the class character of certain linguistic practices. The use of French by certain circles of the aristocracies in England and Russia *did* have a class character even though it in no way imparted a class character to the French language *as such*. The same thing in a different context is a different thing. I could draw an analogy to what I was saying about music a while back.\n\n\n>The class character of music is no more an inherent attribute of the materiality of music than is value an inherent attribute of use-value. The materiality of music is the material depository for social relations. The class character of music consists in the concrete social relations that make music what it is and as such is inherently relative.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1htsadh/comment/m64iez1/\n\n\nI am less clear about the status of modern spoken Hebrew *as such*, given that its development was closely connected with the development of the Zionist project. Stalin specifically does not talk about languages in the context of colonialism, though it is clear that he would not consider the colonized and colonizer to belong to the same nation, as\n\n\n>the Germans and Letts in the Baltic region.\n\n\nLike I said in another comment, Hebrew in Palestine does have a class character because we are not dealing with a national unit but rather with a settler population living parasitically off a colonized nation (class mediated by race), two distinct societies. Also unclear to me is the status of, for example, T\u00e2y B\u1ed3i Pidgin French or Settler Swahili, each of which served to facilitate communication between colonizer and colonized in the course of their economic relations, the former apparently being spoken by the colonized, the latter by the colonizer.\n\n\nAs for other aspects of Stalin's statements on language:\n\n\n>What has changed in the Russian language in this period?\n\n\nIt is strange that he does not mention the orthographic reform. I wonder if this suggests that Stalin did not consider written language to properly be language.\n\n\nStalin repeatedly says things like\n\n\n>the grammatical system of the language has improved\n\n\n>perfects its grammatical system\n\n\n>with a grammatical system of its own\u2014true, a primitive one, but a grammatical system nonetheless\n\n\nHe doesn't expand on this point so it leaves me asking what he thinks makes one grammatical system better than another. Frankly, I think this assertion is rubbish and can easily be appropriated for the most reactionary purposes.\n\n\nThe only possible exceptions I can see would be the presence of grammatical gender (something Stalin was likely not concerned with), honorifics and other markers for social status and those marginal areas of grammatical ambiguity that give rise to hesitation or avoidance.\n\n\nIt is otherwise with the vocabulary of a language, which indeed develops in accordance with the needs of a developing society.\n\n\n(Continued below...)",

In view of this, some local dialects, in the process of formation of nations, may become the basis of national languages and develop into independent national languages.\n\n\nIncidentally, I do seem to differ from Stalin in my usage of \u201clanguage,\u201d \u201cdialect\u201d and \u201cgrammar.\u201d Stalin\u2019s use of \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201cdialect\u201d seems closer to the colloquial rather than the specialist usage.\n\n\n>Further, it would be quite wrong to think that the crossing of, say, two languages results in a new, third language which does not resemble either of the languages crossed and differs qualitatively from both of them. As a matter of fact one of the languages usually emerges victorious from the cross retains its grammatical system and its basic word stock and continues to develop in accordance with its inherent laws of development, while the other language gradually loses its quality and gradually dies away.\n\n\n>Consequently, a cross does not result in some new, third language; one of the languages persists, retains its grammatical system and basic word stock and is able to develop in accordance with its inherent laws of development.\n\n\nDoes Bislama retain the grammatical system and basic word stock of English? Is Bislama English? And what about mixed languages? Maybe those don't satisfy Stalin's definition of \u201clanguage\u201d?\n\n\n>specific words and expressions with a class tinge are used in speech not according to rules of some sort of \"class\" grammar, which does not exist, but according to the grammatical rules of the existing language common to the whole people.\n\n\nThere are of course class grammars insofar as there are class dialects and jargons, but Stalin's point is that these have much more in common with the national standard than different from it. But phonology (which I consider to be part of grammar, whereas Stalin seems not to) is often the part of grammar that is most different from the national standard. Stalin focuses on the semantic aspect whereas phonological practices can also have a class character.",

Let me just take this opportunity to illustrate how dishonest bourgeois scholars are by following the footnotes.\n\nWikipedia says\n\n>In later times, Eduard Bernstein passed the manuscripts to Albert Einstein, who thought the science confused (particularly the mathematics and physics) but the overall work worthy of a broader readership.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectics_of_Nature\n\nThe citation points to Hunt's *The Frock-Coated Communist*, p. 289, which says\n\n>Eduard Bernstein, one of Engels\u2019s literary executors, passed the manuscripts to Albert Einstein, who thought the science confused (especially the mathematics and physics) but the overall work of such historical note as to be worthy of a broader readership.\n\nHunt's citation points to Barbu's review of the French edition of *Dialectics of Nature*, which says\n\n>In doubt about its scientific value, Bernstein showed the manuscript amongst others to Albert Einstein who, in spite of the fact that the manuscript did not present a particular interest from the point of view of physics or of the history of physics, did not oppose its publication.\n\nhttps://www.doi.org/10.2307/2216483\n\nAs for what Einstein actually said, see his note of June 30, 1924.\n\n>If this manuscript came from an author who was not of interest as a historical personality, I would not recommend printing it, because the content is not of particular interest either from the point of view of modern physics or for the history of physics. On the other hand, I can imagine that this text would be considered for publication insofar as it represents an interesting contribution to the illumination of Engels' intellectual personality.\n\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol14-doc/516\n\nMoreover, Einstein probably only saw a portion of the work we now know as *Dialectics of Nature*.\n\nSo we can see that Hunt invented the notion that Einstein \"thought the science confused (especially the mathematics and physics)\" out of whole cloth.\n\nAnyway, do you have any specific criticisms of Engels' physics?",

Although it would be nice to see them defending their revisionism and fail.\n\nThere is a weird \"public server\" in brazilian discord. They are a online \"Mao Zedong Thought\" group of no more than 3000 members. They do not consider china socialist as any shameful denguist would, but they downplay its violence and exploitation of the proletariat. They reject the cultural revolution and are petty-bourgeois or lumpen or students from public universities.  Along with that, they allow some \"online MLMs\" along them, but they reject everything and are not even the strand of \"online MLMs\" that is becoming more popular. They also are revisionists in the sense of negating the reality Stalin and the CPSU fought against in what is useful for revisionism and attracting petty-bourgeois consciousness young people terminally online, while being generally adopters of any kind of falsification that suits eclecticism and online social club life, offering types of mutual aid by \"online free psychologists\" and other crap, revisionist support for voting and culture war bullshit, siding for PT, fears of bolsonaro \"fascism\", and all of that stuff. They offer cinema, courses of \"marxism\", history, online communal reading of theory, essentially trying to pretend as a  \"party\" in the internet.\n\nIn fact, they are wholly made of eclecticism, do petty-commodity production by teaching \"marxism\" online or centering their personalities to adulation as \"influencers\" and all of that, or playing games in streams. They obviously do not accept the labour aristocracy as something as seriously as MLM treats and as far as i know do not even mention its existence, and actually have a hard white chauvinist petty-bourgeois class analysis and completely ignore the possibility of settler-colonialism. They also believe there are loads of proletarians in the imperialist countries and all of that and that brazil is \"deindustrializing\", likely dependency theory bullshit involved. Some of them are religious, had previously religious cells in their group. Many of them are not surprisingly of a white leadership, and many are trans or black, lawyers, philosophy majors, teachers.\n\nAt a first sight, it would only appear as a group of terminally online weirdos with grifting intentions and a interesting form of revisionism they profess, but there is a thing that makes it more interesting: They appeared from a opportunist liquidationist schism from a very large discord server of 50 thousand people which is famous for being a internet commodity production wing of multiple youtubers which follow the same discord server party simulacrum model, essentially a successful mass online \"communism\" grifting scheme, being also the \"online front\" of one of the revisionist \"hoxhaite\" electoral parties which is one of the youngest revisionist ones, with a lot of similarities to PSL, alligned with PT, which has already had their party members here \"shilling\" for it when the party was accused of being revisionist. \n\nThe \"MZTs\" also had multiple internal scandals where from bigotry to psychological violence against members happened, and they also shun people who are close to them personally when they fall down to their unwritten tone policing rules. In essence, these \"MZT\" revisionists are academic petty-bourgeois empirist revisionists, which apparently adopt some kind of revisionist very right-wing view of mao. They are (or were?) tied up in \"alliance\" to another discord server fascists who are from the same country and are anarchists of the general individualist strand of the west, petty-bourgeois and lumpen who adopt all kinds of reactionary, mysoginist, transphobic and anti-proletarian ideas, even if they are mostly trans or black or brown.\n\nI saw smoke in the past talking about how the internet allowed labels such as MZT to pass as ideologies for commodity ideology shopping and how these people attempt to spit out the history of China and the USSR to satisfy reactionaries and being receptive to them. Does anyone ever saw some kind of actually real \"org\" or party similar to this or could give names and materials to explore their general \"MZT\" theoretical revisionism and damaging histories and how they ended or are today? I also wait for the possibility of any brazilians who know what group i am talking about and know or heard stories and their general bullshit to bring stuff about them. I think they may never be able to actually do any kind of impact in reality, but the chance of their revisionism being copied in the future is not far-fetched, maybe even internationally, or they may have contacts with international revisionist actual parties which someone may know about, and i really am wondering how this kind of online delusional idealist attempt to \"do a online \"vanguard party\" but not call it one\" emerges as a form of degraded idealist revisionism and is attractive to socially isolated white petty-bourgeois people and to segregated petty-bourgeois consciousness minorities, but also as a offshot mix of commodity youtube video producers, being likely one of the most disgusting forms of crypto-anarchist, nihilist social-fascism i heard about.\n\nI also think it may not work even for living off the money \"comrades\", by the hands of undisciplined idiots, but it may actually have success in becoming a grifting operation model in a new try by a set of people somewhere around the world besides brazil by copying and modifying it, as long as more people become secluded at home and antisocial in the younger parts of the third-world petty-bourgeoisies and in the first-world labour aristocracies.",

As early as 2009, there was a line within FRSO that [praised the modern CPC and attacked the GPCR as ultra-leftist.](https://frso.org/main-documents/looking-back-at-tiananmen-square-the-defeat-of-counter-revolution-in-china/) While the article is mainly about Tiananmen, you can see pretty familiar talking points:\n\n> Mao\u2019s death and the arrest of the Gang of Four brought the period of the Cultural Revolution to a close. However, contrary to the expectations of many China-watchers, the Party did not carry out a process of de-Maoification. When Deng Xiaoping was asked by a journalist about the role of Mao in Chinese history, Deng responded: \u201cWe will reaffirm that his contributions are primary and his mistakes are secondary. We will adopt a realistic approach towards the mistakes he made late in life. We will continue to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought, which represents the correct part of Chairman Mao\u2019s life. Not only did Mao Zedong Thought lead us to victory in the past, it is, and will continue to be, a treasured possession of the Chinese Communist Party and of our country\u2026.We will not do to Chairman Mao what Khrushchev did to Stalin.\u201d\n\n> The basic point here is that not only did the Communist Party of China intend to continue to uphold the historical contributions of Mao but there was also recognition that Mao Zedong Thought was not the personal property of any one individual. It was the collective product of the Party in its effort to apply Marxism-Leninism to Chinese conditions, and as such it was perfectly appropriate for the Party to systematize it and to continue to propagate it.\n\nThis kind of revisionism was a novelty at the time. For comparison, [this 2007 PSL write-up is more critical of the CPC's revisionism:](https://www.liberationschool.org/what-do-socialists-defend-in-china-today/)\n\n> At the time, some observers of the Chinese Revolution considered the accusation that certain party leaders were \u201ccapitalist roaders\u201d to be one more rhetorical flourish or excess of the Cultural Revolution. But the accusation, as it turned out, was not overheated rhetoric at all. It was a precise and accurate description of Mao\u2019s political opponents inside the leadership of the Communist Party.\n\n> Following Mao\u2019s death in 1976, the left wing of the party was routed and its leaders were arrested. By 1978, the \u201ccapitalist roaders,\u201d galvanized under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, introduced sweeping economic reforms under the newly concocted and theoretically unfounded label of \u201cmarket socialism.\u201d\n\nThough I'm not sure how necessary it is to read these documents or go into detailed investigation of these parties' histories, at least to understand \"MZT.\" I think these talking points just spread through social media and sub-communities adopt them for their own purposes. The analysis you give of these Discords is probably more important as that's where these youth are getting their info from. This part especially surprised me:\n\n>  They appeared from a opportunist liquidationist schism from a very large discord server of 50 thousand people which is famous for being a internet commodity production wing of multiple youtubers which follow the same discord server party simulacrum model, essentially a successful mass online \"communism\" grifting scheme, being also the \"online front\" of one of the revisionist \"hoxhaite\" electoral parties which is one of the youngest revisionist ones, with a lot of similarities to PSL, alligned with PT, which has already had their party members here \"shilling\" for it when the party was accused of being revisionist.\n\nI don't think US communist parties have Discord servers associated with it, wow.",

                            "body": "\"I don't think US communist parties have Discord servers associated with it, wow.\"\n\nYes. This is the main aspect which shows novelty and innovation in their revisionism. They are sided with the government and with its parties alliance but they actually get some very few people elected. The general understanding they grasped to push for this kind of online commodity consumption model as a massive discord server with multiple \"marxist-leninists\" and \"maoists\" youtubers selling their revisionism, entertainment, adulation, is something that is unique, particularly at a post-covid era where people who have the class \"privilege\" are more and more online and homesick, and the idea to directly expose the party is involved with the \"online party\" and that its members are part of it are a specific kind of leap, that now their \"MZT\" liquidationist coupers are following. \n\nThe MZT group appeared as a second-rank admin set of members from the first server. As the original server tied up to the party is massive, they have something like two or three ranks of admins. They are so huge in terms of petty-bourgeois left penetration that now they are promoting online their own live coverage of brazilian carnaval on youtube and profiting from it. But two years ago, something along this line happened: The MZTs argue that sexual abuse scandals, transphobia and other issues arised with the first admin set and the youtuber elite, which led to their schism. But the history just doesnt fits adequately, as a number of similar crisis, purges and general chaos happened in the MZT split server of 3000 people, and that they had racist, obnoxious, bigoted personalities (and still have). At their split, the trans youtubers and admin ranks also split, one to each side. The problem is also that it indicates some level of spontaneist and \"programming\" logic in their narrative: if the problems were so widespread of bigotry, transphobia, and racism in the first server, why did they only had 3000 people with no power joining them, when they have a massive membership of young trans teenagers? Were the other people just dumb and not aware of it? that would be a very bad understanding of how minority consciousness work, and no kind of mod censorship and banning can hide these issues from public.\n\nThe MZT server actively tolerated months ago their anarchist satellite server personal friends administration to still plot for attempting to destroy (including with legal actions, and other kinds of fed tiping) the original server tied up to the fake hoxhaite party, which is a suspicious sigh that they also likely are part of that. So something is generating these dynamics where other ideological fringes in the brazilian left are attempting to copy the model and create their own servers and some kind of online sectarian emulation of physical \"orgs\" and \"party\" sectarianism happens.\n\nWhat will surprise you is that the Brazilian MLMpM party that leads the ICL has their (or membership or sympathizer-alligned to it. it is unclear if they are really behind the server) own discord \"maoist\" server, which has general issues with the MZT server described and with the party-affiliated server, and both servers plus the anarchist one use the ICL brazilian party as a strawman to turn maoism into a joke in the brazilian internet, to attack the PCP and to misinterpret gonzalo texts and pretend they know anything about maoism. Any online kid talking about MLM in the party-affiliated server for too much time leads to a ban. Any kid talking in the MZT or anarchist server about maoism or showing the MZT server reactionarism or the anarchist server settler-fascist politics leads them to do a inquisition emulation and to turn it into a disputatio plus personal aggressions and tone policing tactics, and if you push too far the argument, they ban you with any random false accusation. But the MLMpM majority server still exists to counter them as a social club and as a \"study group\", so even the dogmatist white chauvinist \"maoists\" are tailing these tactics. I would not be surprised they may also eventually tail the entryism.",

Maybe I haven't looked hard enough tbh. \n\n>I'm interested in finding a starting point for reading on a general history of art, preferably alongside an analysis of its ideological role and as an expression of class.\n\nI can toss you books from peeps like Christopher Caudwell, Walter Benjamin, and some writings from Gramsci on essays in dying bourgeois culture, the mechanical reproduction of art, and 1920s Avanti! Paper Entries respectively. \n\nBut these are superficial recommendations on my end, partially because if you held me at gunpoint and asked me to give a 10th grade interpretation on exactly how relevant Caudwell's Illusion and Reality is to today where the conditions for which poetry existing as a popular art form and an arena where culture can be interrogated and fought to death over is dead, well frankly I'd shit myself in ashamed horror. This can be remedied on my end by just, reading them again, self-guilt is for petite-bourgeois losers anyways. \n\nPartially also but more importantly really, I don't know what your goals would be after you're \"done\" reading Caudwell or Benjamin and you absorbed enough art analysis for the week or two. Hence, the recommendations could just be a doomed effort. Again, you said you are a Musician so I assume you have plans on \"sharing\" your art with a wider audience. This just goes back to questions like who would your audience would be, how would you disseminate your \"art\" or more accurately, your communist politics in a way that differentiates yourself from someone like...Kendrick, or Nickelback.",

Its because you are applying unconsciously that your consumption of things somehow involve they are a matter of taste, when political memes are in their form just a rehearsed fascistic transmission of fascistic ideas or aesthetics. The frankfurt school explained that, famously. Actions are not also separated in a vacuum. They emerge due to internal logic that is developed by a self with the other in the rest of society, and some actions emulate the external. \n\nYou somehow believe you have a individual subjectivity on that that is pure, but that does not exist. Individuals and agencies do not exist. What exists are beings with individuations and society plus structures and external general conditions exists and influences you outside of you. Your characteristics are also determined by a unequal and non-harmonic mix of your being and the others in society plus the rest of things i cited above.\n\n\"That\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong man. Every part of my life is changed by my autism. My social interactions, my food intake, my work, my hobbies, even my ability to go into a stressful environment is all changed by my autism. That is my life context. Even if you don\u2019t agree, please don\u2019t tell me what my culture and life context are like.\"\n\nThere is not a monolithic \"autistic culture\" There are historical strands and sets of cultural signs which accumulated in decades. You follow a cultural set that was degraded by internet-era commodity production, and i am not saying this to personally offend you, and the prevalence of this set is circunscript to class origin and country and region. \n\nThe \"natural\" determinants of \"being autistic\" that influence on what you are and how you feel are not as heavy and not as hard in any \"autistic person\", and even in those who are, the external influence of external societal and structural conditioning is as hard as to anyone. If you are what people would call in \"ableist\" language a \"third degree autistic\", your life and cultural background is heavily different from those who are similar to you in eritrea and were born in a proletarian family, because your general conditions your family and state can provide to you are radically different",

It is a continuously determined (not discretely) amount which varies and is conditioned by a number of things, and inside specific classes, races, genders... When people say \"trump supporters are reactionaries\" they are speaking about specific people from specific classes along other categories. It is generally a vast majority, because reactionarism either appears due to desire of mantaining power in political economic sense (such as the superprofits of the american labour aristocracy), or as a reaction against other classes by oppressed class who are being smashed and have nowhere to go.\n\n The Brazilian (black and indigenous) proletariat supports the far-right, adopts a bourgeois consciousness and sides with the bourgeoisie temporarily because it has to fight against the petty-bourgeoisie attempting to smash it with the social-fascists in power right now to not suffer from proletarization and pure racist hate and violence of their culture, of their music, of their religions, of their view of the world which is not \"western\", of their general specific ways of living, which translates in genocide in slums and forests, at any period where unemployment and hunger spreads and this petty-bourgeoisie asks for the police or the army to kill people due to \"being robbed\" in their luxury apartments.\n\nObviously i am not saying my grandmother is the proof of this or that everyone is like her.

They're not stupid, they're not children, and they're not ideological blank slates just waiting to receive the gospel and be saved. The fact that they're not able to explicitly articulate their interests in terms of their class, and retroactively justify their actions in different terms, doesn't mean they don't understand their own material conditions, class position, and the fact that supporting Trump is in their interests (for example, your statement that \"they vote for Trump because their family voted for Trump\" is a clear example of this - choosing to align with their family is a strategy for maintaining their position as a member of their class, preserving their social capital, and maybe even directly ensuring economic capital is transmitted to them).  You're arguing on postmodernist terms by claiming that objective truth is inaccessible to humans, that it's all just opinion and one opinion is as good as another, so the highest good is to just air out any disagreement so we can each defend our perceived social capital without the necessity of critically examining our own class position and the ideas that stem from it. \n\nThere is a correct perspective, and that perspective is the one that faithfully represents reality to the point that it allows us to carry out actions whose consequences are in line with our predictions. What we're trying to predict in this subreddit is how to successfully act on the side of the proletariat in the class struggle. We know that infantilizing Trump supporters, as you've done repeatedly in your comments, will not materially help the proletariat in any way, both because it's an action stemming from wrong premises and a wrong grasp of reality and because liberals keep trying it over and over with no effect.",

They are acting in their class interests (and the fact that people aren't \"all the same\" doesn't stop them from having common interests on the basis of their material conditions). Just explaining the \"complexities of the issues\" to them will not stop them from acting according to their class interests, even if they may alter a specific behavior - believing otherwise is idealism. Explaining the class basis of the issue to you hasn't stopped you from a flailing defense the petty bourgeois ideology that reflects your own class position, so we already have an immediate example of your premises breaking down.",

That's because you're petty-bourgeois, no further investigation needed.\n\nDisordered eating often has its roots in trauma and it can absolutely affect the oppressed.  Here are some recent examples from the West Bank.\n\n>Layla, a 13-year-old girl, presents with a mysterious inability to eat, describing a sensation that \u201csomething in my throat prevents me from eating; there is a thorn blocking my gorge.\u201d Despite extensive medical examinations, no physical cause has been found. Further discussion revealed that Layla\u2019s father was arrested by Israeli forces and she has heard nothing about him since. Layla\u2019s inability to eat is a psychosomatic response to the trauma of her father\u2019s detention and her awareness of the starvation, torture and sexual violence inflicted on Palestinian political prisoners. She was also deeply affected by the reports of starvation and violence in Gaza, drawing parallels between the suffering in Gaza and her father\u2019s uncertain fate, which amplified her psychosomatic symptoms.\n\n>Riham, a 15-year-old girl, has developed repetitive involuntary vomiting and a profound disgust with food, particularly meat. Her family has a history of obesity and gastrectomy but she has denied any concerns about body image. She attributes her vomiting to the images of blood and dismemberment of people in Gaza that she has seen. Over time, her aversion has extended to flour-based foods, driven by the fear that they might be mixed with animal fodder. Although she understands that this does not happen where she is, her stomach rejects the food when she attempts to eat.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/11/2/how-israels-starvation-of-gaza-is-affecting-palestinians-elsewhere\n\nI've also heard of children who grew up during war developing an inability to eat rice because it reminds them of the maggots they saw on corpses.\n\nIncidentally, this topic reminds me of that ideology of smell topic smoke raised recently.  I still need to check that out.\n\nWith the above said, I haven't really interrogated the concept of ableism and I don't have a clear Marxist understanding of questions relating to mental health in general.  I'd be interested to hear what others have to say.",

People are bringing actually objective opinions in most of the times when they are doing so and have the conditions to do so, but that demands rigorous treatment of questions and sentences and actual strong logic and sometimes formal structure, or some simplicity of what is being treated as a subject that allows intuitive answering with objective truths (such as, for example, that we should not assault children).\n\nSome things are done like that by \"conventional\" logic, some only by dialectics. In this case in the last replies here, there was a confusion from the start of what was sent as a sentence and what was presumed as a premise by the receiver. But if i say to you \"Hitler was a racist\", there is not much room for subjectivity. When i say to you \"Trump supporters are reactionaries\", there is not truth in the in the sense of \"100% of trump supporters are reactionaries\", but there is objective truth in \"the obscene majority of trump supporters are reactionaries\". \n\nThe discourse, dissertative or language problems in the midst of debates or arguments are just spurious emissions that are generally not a thing that turns the sentence impossible to verify, but instead, in the worst cases that are still not unsolvable, the transmission that another third person around the oral dialogue of the two people can listen to them and filter, if there is enough information for connecting again the broken puzzle.\n\n Lies cannot be pushed as truth forever not to everyone, as the rhetoric or argument peculiarities that may hide what is not true from what is, or make it sound credible, cannot just hold what is false from being differentiated from truth by the \"trained\" (by life,  experience, labour, study) eye, particularly when they are self-evident and contradict with the experience of those who are more deeply submerged into reality and not in mystified perceptions, which generally take a wider form in idealism.",

I hope this comment might be useful to others here or for critique of me. I just wanted to share some of my ideas that I've been going over on here as it's hard to get good ideas from my non-digital surroundings as I'm surrounded by Reactionaries(Settlers, \"Asians\"(though iirc the term has been critiqued here before) that have been incorporated into Whiteness, and PB/LA Black and Chicane(who have no interest in Revolution and are either milquetoast liberals or Libertarians)).\n\nEdit: Formating",

The Capitalists pockets 1hr in order to furnish their social existence and leaves 1hr for the future expansion of production.

I think we're talking about the intersection between petty-bourgeois consciousness and the consciousness of the intellectual labourer, between two distinct consciousnesses. I don't think the petty bourgeoisie in general desires to do as little labour as possible any more than the proletariat does. The whole point of the concept of the petty bourgeoisie is that it combines the characteristics of labourer and proprietor. The petty bourgeoisie is a labouring class, it reproduces itself through labour (albeit not through labour alone), unlike the bourgeoisie.\n\n\nThe upper stratum of the petty bourgeoisie believes it is within reach to rise into the lower stratum of the bourgeoisie, and so bourgeois ideology is dominant in its thinking and it looks down on labour (hence, it looks down subjectively on its own current objective circumstances). But that is not the petty bourgeoisie as such. In *Breaking with Old Ideas*, the lower-middle peasants are petty-bourgeois, but they side with the proletariat against the petty-bourgeois intellectuals who are pushing the bourgeois line in education. Now, the people who post here are not lower-middle peasants from the third world, but my point is that the petty bourgeoisie is much broader than the segment of it that posts on Reddit. Maybe you were getting at this by bringing up division along national lines.\n\n\nNot only is active learning more work, but it is also more threatening to the bourgeois ego. Lots of people put up a fa\u00e7ade of distance between themselves and their own ideas when they post, and are deeply offended when that fa\u00e7ade is ignored and we point out the connection between the ideas in the post and the ideas in their post history, like the OP here who \"drew a boundary and it was crossed.\" Politeness, civility and collegiality are defence mechanisms against this vulnerability. It is the same with the agnosticism the OP has been pushing here, the OP is afraid to take a position on reality. This is perfectly in line with the wavering character of the petty bourgeois as \"the embodiment of contradiction\" combined with the petty-bourgeois intellectual\u2019s isolation from physical labour and hence from material reality, which is a particular expression of the narrowness that is typical of the petty bourgeois as such. This exchange is relevant:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1ikhffp/how_to_differentiate_pettybourgoeis_consciousness/",

Discussing a reader\u2019s response to their review of the book *Fasting Girls: The Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa as a Modern Disease* (which seems instructive itself on this topic, based on their review), MIM notes:\n\n>Certainly the analogy between anorexic women in the First World and religiously fasting women in the Third World is not empty. Women in both locales are discouraged from involvement in politics and encouraged to spend more time in the realm of the spiritual, the abstract and the superficial. The\nrelevant point in our review of Fasting Girls was similar to yours: researchers may often find objective similarities among women in Amerika and women in India for example - both fast from time to time. But these objective similarities do not necessarily illuminate the subjective motivations these same researchers are trying to explain.\n\n\u2026\n\n>Amerikan women, for example, may be culturally discouraged from taking part in politics, but their retreat from politics into the realm of concern over body image is a symptom of mass decadence. They have the alternative of seizing political power, yet they choose to spend time and endanger themselves with concern over the way their bodies look. It seems incongruous to compare Amerikan women\u2019s retreat from power they do have to Indian women seeking alternative to power they don\u2019t have.\n\n\u2026\n\n>anorexia nervosa in the 20th century is defined by the predominance of successful women among those who have the disease. You are correct that in both the 19th and 20th centuries anorexia has been an attempt by women to control a portion of their own lives. What you missed in the review is that women who are anorexic in the 20th century are principally those women who have benefitted from increased control in all spheres of their own lives other than the shape of their bodies. It continues to be poor and Black women \u2014 those who control their lives to a significantly smaller degree than white women \u2014 who are not anorexic.\n\nI suppose the analogy here is an amerikan refusing to eat carrots being more akin to the case of anorexia in amerikan women, whereas young Palestinians refusing to eat is more akin to the example of religious fasting. Following MIM\u2019s line on gender, \u201cpicky eating\u201d\u2014particularly characteristic of young children\u2014would be a product of gendered oppression of children; the same objective basis, albeit a different subjective motivation. I am not sure if I\u2019m overreaching here, though**. The differences between the First and Third World response to the variance in the objective conditions of gender oppression is summarized as such:\n\n>It is the basic female condition under patriarchy to be excluded from politics, as poor Indian women are. It is basic glorification of female subordination to place one\u2019s own sexuality ahead of political participation, which is what women in the First World do daily.\n\nI was discussing this article recently with a friend, who criticized MIM for a lax attitude towards religiosity, exemplified in the quote, \u201cwe would guess that [Jainist women] are thinking about something more meaningful than looking like supermodels when they [fast]\u201d.\n\nI suppose MIM is making the point (similar to u/Chaingunfighter) to \u201c[challenge] privileged women who think they are not powerful to recognize how powerful they really are\u201d, with a political conclusion being class/national suicide, but the phenomena of fasting/\u201cpickiness\u201d in the Third World still are subjective political issues that require a confrontation; if \u201cIndian women [are] seeking alternative to power they don\u2019t have\u201d, wouldn\u2019t the challenge remain to agitate those women towards the path to seizing political power? Shouldn\u2019t this consciousness*** be challenged in the same way that other contradictions (like religion more broadly) among the masses are? How should this be dealt with among young Palestinians refusing/unable to eat?\n\n\n*edit: The specific articles to which I am referring are, in MIM Theory Volume 2/3, \u201cFasting Girls: The Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa as a Modern Disease\u201d, and in Volume 9, \u201cAnorexia as Body Control\u201d. The latter is more primarily the focus of this comment.\n\n**edit 2: I do think that the analysis I forward here does also ignore entirely the points you brought up about the conditions of war, political imprisonment of family members, and availability of food in the ongoing genocide. That isn\u2019t to say that gender oppression can\u2019t be a factor, though I would doubt its primacy compared to what you highlighted.\n\n***edit 3: Would calling the instances you\u2019re describing \u201cconsciousness\u201d even be appropriate/correct?",

What does that mean for me if I don\u2019t like them?\n\nThat makes no sense here because the terms you are using are wrong. In this case you would have to interrogate the definition of \"tasting good in general\" which is usually just chauvinism. But that's probably not what you're referring to, and I'm guessing you were just being imprecise. When you say \"something tastes good,\" you are speaking of a sensation that you are prone to experience after eating the food. It isn't a good counter-example since carrots tasting good here is not an opinion but a culinary predilection which can be the realization of many things and experiences in the individual's history as a living organism. It could be the result of a fond memory, mere exposure, or the realization of some physiological or psychological condition (this includes but is not limited to \"mental illness;\" I imagine anyone who lives in a place that considers cannibalism taboo might retch at eating human meat if they knew what it was beforehand but that has nothing to do with the meat itself). The immediate phenomenon of deriving pleasure from eating a carrot is proof enough that it \"tastes good\" and the sources of these predilections and disinclinations can be scientifically ascertained: if it's a matter of sentimental attachment or trauma then it can be historically traced back to some event or sequence of events, for instance. Barely is it ever the case that, when someone says \"Carrots taste good,\" they mean that \"everyone's brains react in the exact same way when carrots touch their tongue, everyone experiences this particular pleasurable sensation, anyone who says they don't is a liar.\" That's obviously just wrong and not a matter of relativity since it ignores a lot of scientifically ascertained knowledge concerning human physiology and psychology. Usually what they mean is \"everyone is obligated to experience the taste of carrots in this way based on so-and-so principle,\" and there the task is to just interrogate said principle.\n\nAnyway, an opinion is just \"a judgement formed about a matter\" (Oxford Languages), and thus the judgement on the matter can either be correct or incorrect (since the matter being discussed is a real thing, part of reality, part of the totality of existence and the matrix of causative relationships of which reality consists, it genuinely makes no sense to disagree with this, reality can either be this way or that way, things are either a way or not a way). Truth is the result of the correct application of Marxism, it is a product of a particular process. Absolute Truth (I usually just say reality^[1] ) exists regardless of whether we think of it or not, the objective universe outside and beyond us.\n\n----\n\n^[1] /u/Autrevml1936, I reread Mao's _Talk on Questions of Philosophy_ recently and he seems to think that there is no goal and thus \"reaching\" would make no sense. Here's the section I'm referring to:\n\n> I don\u2019t believe that communism will not be divided into stages, and that there will be no qualitative changes. Lenin said that all things can be divided. He gave the atom as an example, and said that not only can the atom be divided, but the electron, too, can be divided. [...] This is the truth. If you don\u2019t believe it, just consider. If it could be reduced to zero, then there would be no such thing as science. The myriad things develop continuously and limitlessly, and they are infinite. Time and space are infinite. As regards space, looking at it both macroscopically and microscopically, it is infinite, it can be divided endlessly. So even after a million years scientists will still have work to do.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding Mao yet but my tentative position is that this is true: there is no end, everything reduces and breaks apart infinitely downwards, there is no atom of existence, and therefore \"Absolute Truth\" does not exist because a subjective comprehension of the totality of existence in its full complexity is impossible due to reality's infinite complexity. As a visualization, a function with a horizontal asymptote trends towards that horizontal asymptote as the values of the input increase, but there is no value from the domain that actually maps to the y-value of the horizontal asymptote. Truth is reality's mental reflection, it can be comparatively closer or farther, the framework can be either comparatively correct or not so, but speaking of \"reaching\" sounds weird. But I know that you are more well-read than me so I'm not sure if this is just an error on my part. What do you think?",

It is the product of the mind that corresponds to what is outside and independent of it, in other words, is objective. Therefore, 'Ideal Truth' does not have that meaning nor is 'Ideal' synonymous with either 'Abstract' or 'False'. As for the term 'Objective Truth', it is a pleonasm but it can be useful for emphasizing the objectivity of it against those who deny it, as, for example, Lenin did against the 'Empirio-Criticists'.\n\nThat something is abstract does not necessarily mean that it is false. But, taken by itself, it is, at best, limited in its correspondence to reality. Only when integrated into a system of concrete knowledge does the abstraction get its full significance. In that case, the abstraction loses its abstract character.\n\nHow we reach concrete knowledge is through abstractions. From the study of abstract phenomena, we (human society) progressively construct concrete knowledge (of course, the validity of each abstraction is dependent on the actual relation between the abstract phenomenon and the rest of the system in study). Absolute truth, complete correspondence between knowledge and reality in all its concreteness, is very likely to be unreachable because reality is infinitely complex. However, every relative truth is a part of absolute truth:\n\n> The sum total of innumerable relative truths constitutes absolute truth.\n\nEven if our (human society) knowledge is relative at every step of the way, it tendentially approaches absolute truth; Each advance is part of absolute truth because truth is objective:\n\n> From the standpoint of modern materialism i.e., Marxism, the limits of approximation of our knowledge to objective, absolute truth are historically conditional, but the existence of such truth is unconditional, and the fact that we are approaching nearer to it is also unconditional. The contours of the picture are historically conditional, but the fact that this picture depicts an objectively existing model is unconditional. When and under what circumstances we reached, in our knowledge of the essential nature of things, the discovery of alizarin in coal tar or the discovery of electrons in the atom is historically conditional; but that every such discovery is an advance of \u201cabsolutely objective knowledge\u201d is unconditional. In a word, every ideology is historically conditional, but it is unconditionally true that to every scientific ideology (as distinct, for instance, from religious ideology), there corresponds an objective truth, absolute nature.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/two5.htm",

I forgot just how sulky redditors tend to be outside of this subreddit. I'm taking a tone of \"superiority\" (that is to say, I'm not bothering to pretend that our opinions are equally \"valid\" and am treating you like a person who has an incorrect view that should be corrected) to you because you are wrong and I am right.\n\n> You apply what you know from past experiences onto the current one, to see if the phenomena fits within your scope of knowledge.\n\nWell, yes. Reality is generally^1 agnostic to the concepts that float in our head; we construct and refine the concepts by **social** practice, either by direct interaction with them or by direct transmission of the concept from others. If you agree with this then what is the point of fixating over objective contradictions in the concept of \"toasting\"? \"Toasting\" is a word used in the context of cooking; in a domestic setting the word leaves room for ambiguity precisely because the concept itself is not rigorously constructed and is mostly defined based on visual and tactile information (because little more is **socially** necessary and, barring cases like maybe being visually impaired, the visual-tactile information is enough for the technique to be reproduced **socially**). You will find, then, that the people who are interested in constructing a more rigorous definition of toasting (based on the grain used to make the bread, the bread's moisture, the heat, the period of time, the pressure applied) will be those for whom cooking takes up a greater part of the process of their **social** reproduction; these are precisely the kind of people who might be interested in enforcing this rigor^2. Interpersonal transmission of concepts is not done with brain-to-brain USB cords so the categories that different people form may be slightly different, inching closer together the more similar their **social** experiences and history are. You did not learn what \"toasting\" is as a child from getting an axiomatic definition from an adult, you learnt it from hearing it being used in some context, (maybe) asking what it was and getting a rather shoddy answer, and generally observing social scenarios in which the word was used, therefore inferring its meaning. The ambiguity has a source - maybe your family members generally toasted bread to a certain degree, and that was what was considered \"toasted\" there, while the other person's family members generally toasted their bread more. If you're trying to figure out which definition of \"toasting\" is more correct, then you've lost the plot because toasting is a category of human culinary activity and is specifically a word to describe human **social** activity - it was defined within **social** activity and the sparse examples of it outside of social activity are defined based on how well they adhere to the result of the the social, more typical \"toasting.\" More generally, you are assuming that the \"concept\" already exists in real life in the \"World of Forms\" and it is a matter of finding the particular _form_ of toasting, and the impossibility of the task now flings you towards agnosticism. It's impossible because that's not how conceptualization works at all.\n\n**Nonetheless, reality remains agnostic to concepts in our heads but some concept maps are better than others in that they explain objective reality better. Those caches of concepts and their interconnections that best explain the real material interactions in objective reality are more \"correct\" than those that do not. The geocentric model was \"wrong\" and the heliocentric model \"correct\" because one explained reality more than the other did.**\n\nSome children who happen to own dogs in their house might come to call a cow a \"doggie.\" It's not a slip of the tongue on their part - they really do categorize dogs and cows as the same thing at that point, and will continue to do so until further social interaction makes them adjust. But if your definition of dog encompasses cows and mine distinguishes them, you'll have to explain away the drastic size differences, the drastically different life cycles, the different social positions both occupy among human beings in different places, them not being able to inter-breed, the differences in their meat, etc. Reality will not care whether you call dogs cows but you will be more incorrect than me for doing so and, in interacting with the world, you will stumble where I do not.\n\n> People toast bread, and based on their preferences as well as their experience, they associate traits with burnt bread.\n\nAnd where do these come from? _\"Oh, no, it's too complex.\"_ Unfortunately it's not \"too complex\" and it can be explained (I just did it, though not exhaustively since that would be impossible), so your claim of agnosticism is just a cover for idealism. You must break away with it. Read Lenin's _Materialism and Empiriocriticism_.\n\n> Words are developed from people living their lives applying context to language.\n\nYou meant \"applying language to context and context to language.\" It is both-sided. Read Stalin's _Marxism and Problems of Linguistics_.\n\n> People toast bread, and based on their preferences as well as their experience, they associate traits with burnt bread.\n\nIt's funny that you don't mention the mother here since this quaint toast example you keep bringing up would require a degree of social atomization so severe that the process of words in speakers with similar social interactions trending towards a certain mean would not exist (but then language acquisition wouldn't, the whole reason for the evolution of speech is the facilitation of social intercourse in complex processes of production; this is the opinion of Engels, though I forget which book I read it from). What happens when a child raises up their hand and says \"Toast!\" and their parent sees a Pop Tart in their hand instead? Do they go: \"Oh, I would correct them but that's just their own way of seeing the world, I feel like I shouldn't stifle their opinions at this tender age...\"? Would you?\n\n^1 Obviously we act on the world based on our current ideas on the world and it is by acting on it that our concepts are tested. But I trust that you know that touching cheese to figure out what it is doesn't actually change the history of that block of cheese, doesn't change the process of cheese-production, etc.\n\n^2 This is a similar problem with the \"is tomato a fruit or a vegetable\" matter; it is a \"fruit\" in a botanical sense and a \"vegetable\" in the \"food group\" sense (and this changes across cultures, some people **socially** interact with tomatoes as with other fruits and put them in the same category).",

But the idea that a Slave owner and a Slave just have a difference in opinion regarding the institution of Slavery is clearly absurd and you would 100% (I hope) agree that Slavery is an abhorrent institution. Therefore there definitely are \"correct\" or incorrect ideas. Flat earth, lizard people, Soros running the world, the Master race, bringing \"democracy and freedom\" to middle east, these are all clearly incorrect. The list goes on. \n\n\"Respect my opinion\" is Liberal for: \"please look the other way and stop questioning my actions even if they happen to be evil. Just let me do my own thing.\" Another name for this is \"state's rights\".",

Difference in perspective is literally the reason why diversity of race and gender is so important.\n\nYou should quit while you're ahead, this is both racist and sexist but it's also common-sense liberalism so I'm not shocked. Gender oppressed and racialized people do not exist for \"diversity of opinion\" and you don't need to pontificate on why \"diversity of race and gender is so important,\" as though the existence of gender oppressed and racialized people needs to be justified somehow.\n\n> The idea alone that concepts can be \u201cnot important\u201d enough to have a \u201ccorrect\u201d opinion is absurd. What if I disagree that it isn\u2019t important enough? Do I just have to live with that? This isn\u2019t provable.\n\n/u/Bademjoon's instinct was correct but they were just wrong in this case, it's not about relative importance.\n\n> What is the goal of communism if not to implement it as a government, and in order to do that, you need to convice people, a.k.a. change their perspective\n\nThe destruction of class society, which implies that the class existence of the exploiting classes will be abolished. Whether this means by death, by force, or by them being flung or fleeing into the proletarian camp in desperation isn't really relevant.",
