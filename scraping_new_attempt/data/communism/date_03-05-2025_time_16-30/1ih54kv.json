If you think they cannot do this without genocidal violence that is because you have accepted settler-colonialism as human nature, when in fact it takes great distortions (like abstract labor) to make human beings kill each other.",

As for your hobbies, I don't really care about how you spend your time outside posting on this subreddit, it's just an observation that usually the people who aren't serious about communism can be spotted by their post histories, especially those who spend most of their time engaging in hobby subreddits, especially gaming ones.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy bother \"pretending\" not to be a communist if you consider yourself one?\u00a0\n\n\n>The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Soviets heroically fought the Nazis in defense socialism and their homeland, which you admit isn't even comparable to the U.$. so why lie and say they are equivalent? You want to keep your fascist friends?\n\n\n>Its no different than masking your politics to avoid uncomfortable conversations at the bar.\u00a0\n\n\nBut you aren't avoiding a bar fight and it's not like physical harm can come to you here. We're just posting anonymously with the lowest stakes possible and you're still trying to talk to fascists who don't consider anyone but themselves human beings.",

The native comprador academics? Whether or not there is some anthropological justification for the existence of Aztl\u00e1n or \"indigenous legitimacy\" to it is irrelevant. All the arguments against Aztl\u00e1n fight in the realm of petty nationalist disputes and somewhere along the lines the term \"settler-colonialism\" is thrown in just for good measure so we sound like Decolonial Marxists or something. I hardly ever see anyone pushing the \"Aztl\u00e1n is a settler-colonial concept\" actually give a shit about Chicane people or even try to defend the existence of a Chicane nation on any terms. In fact the opposite happens. What is implied regardless of the intent, is that there is no \"legitimate\" Chicane nation. It's easy to step back and say \"whoah we don't mean that\" and \"I support migrants\" but at the end of the day some failed academic needs to get their paycheck and calling Chicane, \"settlers,\" plays very well into the anti-migrant sentiment already in existence.\n\nThis is likely going to pop up more and more as the anti-ICE protests kick and it's best to nip it in the bud right now. We're in the midst of an emerging national movement of the oppressed and this specific line is detrimental to that.\n\nEdit: Using Aztl\u00e1n as a shorthand for the Chicane nation is fine though it remains to be seen how it is morphed by the current national movement seemingly unified partially around the Mexican flag and Mexican identity. Regardless I expect the same argument from Decolonial Marxists to be that this too is \"illegitimate\" because it supports the Mexican state or something equally incoherent.",

I think at its best ussr provides an excellent example of national coexistence and overlapping national claims. China also holds many autonomous nations within its borders.",
