Unless Cope really did have a mental breakdown, I wonder about his understanding of Marxism in the first place. Oh well. The funniest thing about it is the author bio:\n\n>Zak Cope is Research Fellow at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, and author of Dimensions of Prejudice (2008) and The Wealth of (Some) Nations: Imperialism and the Mechanics of Value Transfer (2019). I am co-editor of the Palgrave Encyclopedia of Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism (2021) and the Oxford Handbook of Economic Imperialism (2022).\n\nI disavow all my previous work but I still put it on my CV.",

Zak Cope cites is horror over the ''bestial violence'' of Hamas ''terrorists'' as the reason why he now hates Marxism; Cope is Northern Irish and brazenly quotes Margeret Thatcher in his newly published screed which likely means that he comes from a Loyalist background considering that Margeret Thatcher is an incredibly despised figure amongst Northern Irish Catholics and nationalists, and Loyalism is to Ireland what Zionism is to Palestine.\n\nMy theory is that Cope probably had a rebellion against his parents or family that was expressed in academic terms, initially citing sectarianism in Northern Ireland caused by British colonialism as the catalyst for writing DWDC, but after the recent uprising in Palestine that began on October 7, Cope has probably realised that he isn't so different from all the Israelis who were killed by the outbreak of revolutionary violence and has now understood what the stakes are for his class, maybe fearing that the IRA or another group like them may do to him what Hamas has done to the beneficiaries of Zionism, and so Cope has given up his rebellion and is now going to embrace settler-colonial ideology.",

Neither had a particularly sufficient explanation of the reproduction of imperialism based within the labor process itself, they merely described *how* value was transferred but failed to correctly identify *why*. Empirically rich but theoretically poor. Sadly we see where the poverty of such theory leads when subject to the forces of academia and revisionism today. Though, this whole episode has lead me to reread Sam King's thesis, partially out of neuroticism but more productively, to get a stronger grasp of it.",

It may be a possible interpretation, It doesn't really help us because we need to understand how someone becomes a neocon on the basis of a scholar who has published about imperialism not just with reference to their class position, but their ideological development which has some degree of independence - which has its own logic and history.",

For example, \n>>If a significant number of nations adopt anti-capitalist policies, this can lead to a shift away from open markets toward more protectionist and statist economic models. Such a shift would undermine the economic growth model upon which many countries rely, potentially leading to economic contractions and increased tensions between nations having differing economic ideologies. The promotion of protectionist nationalism as a socialist response to free market internationalism risks fueling imperial expansionism. When countries adopt trade barriers or protectionist tariffs, they disrupt established supply chains and trade relationships, damaging domestic industries that rely on imports of raw materials or exports of finished goods and lowering economic efficiency by reducing competition.\n\nThis is reminiscent of what China \u201cwants\u201d with its trading partners, to stop tariffs and disruption to trade relationships. Also China\u2019s anti-revolutionary outlook, since it might disturb the global supply chains, is also what is outlined by Cope. \n\n>>Growing trade conflicts and a fragmented global economy could damage necessarily multilateral cooperation on issues such as security, technology, infrastructure development, and the environment (Rohac, 2019). It must also increase distrust and tensions between nations having differing approaches to economic and trade policy. \n\nAll of this comes, nevertheless, with an extreme hostility to every \u201canti-Western/anti-imperialist\u201d movements from history until today\u2014specifically \u201creactionary\u201d ones like Russia or Iran\u2014with October 7 being Cope\u2019s turning point. \n\n>>In recent times, socialists determined to exculpate the governments of Russia and China from any wrongdoing have engaged in atrocity denial in Syria, Xinjiang, and Ukraine. Their massed ranks descended on the streets of Western capitals to denounce Israel in the wake of Hamas\u2019 October 7 pogrom before the country had even had the opportunity to count its civilian dead and kidnapped. Anti-capitalism has served as a major bedrock of the anti-Western (especially anti-American) worldview that makes such egregious moral myopia possible.\n\n\nI also wonder if there was anything immanent to his analysis that forced him to abandon Marxism or whether it was just the typical \u201cthe Left left me\u201d. \n\nPerhaps both, that the Dengism that eventually arose from Cope\u2019s politics came into cognitive dissonance with his personal life, bombarded with propaganda, which left a mess. You\u2019re right that this is not the first and certainly won\u2019t be the last time.",

Or if his training by Queen's University has functionality turned him into a 'protestant' even if that's not how he was brought up. I'm probably stretching though, there are many other reasons why a white academic would have their class interests aligned with Israel, and as it has been pointed out here, Cope looks like an opportunist who refuses to remove his ''toxic'' Marxist works, that he has disavowed, from his CV because he knows that it looks good on his portfolio and that whatever fascist drivel he publishes in the future will never match in terms of citations\n\nEdit: He has now quoted Margeret Thatcher (which no Catholic in Northern Ireland would ever do) and I've heard that he comes from a Loyalist family so I guess that explains where his Zionism comes from and his hostility towards national liberation.",

Those thrilled with this idea should see their new allies. One is Christopher Hitchens(4) denouncing \"theocratic fascism.\" The other is the practically John Birch society rag \"Front Page Magazine\"(4) which has called for a Congressional investigation of MIM. Hitchens is hawking his credentials as a journalist in favor of a war crimes trial for Henry Kissinger et. al. regarding Vietnam while simultaneously talking up G.W. Bush. **Even worse, J. Sakai is calling September 11 2001 the work of \"Pan-islamic fascism pressing home their war.\"**(5) Since none of these Liberals ever claimed to buy into Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism dominated by finance capital, we cannot say we are surprised.

Assuming you read *Settlers*, it's not exactly clear how this would lead you to believe Chicanismo is *specifically* settler-colonial. The argument could be made that elements of Chicanismo (especially those that draw from La raza c\u00f3smica) carry *colonial* baggage from the bourgeois intelligentsia which first articulated it, but note, it is precisely colonial in nature.\n\nFor a vulgar but hopefully illustrative comparison, is Hindutva fascism *settler*-colonial in nature? Clearly not, unless one awkwardly bends all the theorization on it by Indian Maoists through the terms of an already contorted concept of settler-colonialism. Though to be clear, Hindutva is plainly reactionary whereas Chicanismo has the potential to be (and already is to some extent) progressive in the hands of Chicane masses.\n\nHowever, you are correct in that contradictions between Chicanes and First Nations are woefully overlooked and that this has been a historically weak point for anti-revisionists. Though I don't think you've offered much greater clarity yourself in your thread with u/red_star_erika. I don't know what characterizes the class relations between mestizos and indigenous peoples as *settler*-colonial. Mestizos were certainly placed above indigenous people within the Spanish colonial caste system, but mestizos were not settler-colonists (though Penisulares and Criollos arguably were, but of a pre-capitalist form). You'd also have to make the argument that mestizos in other Spanish controlled colonies were/are settler-colonists which starts to diminish the explanatory power of *settler*-colonialism. If you framed the question instead in terms of (post/semi) colonialism colliding with settler-colonialism then I find there is much greater clarity.\n\nEd: Re-reading this again, I think it's necessary to point out a consistent pitfall with the reliance on racial categories like, \"mestizo\" or \"criollo\" and really even the category, \"indigenous\" for that matter. Speaking only in those terms, or placing them as primary, only obfuscates any analysis of the \"Americas\" and keeps things trapped in the realm of postcolonialism where questions of class or productive relations are just some few coins in a pile of loose change to be pulled out from the pockets of academics when it's time to buy a \"new idea.\"",

Chicano migrant proletarians from the third world doesn\u2019t make sense.

The development of the region, before and after the Mexican amerikan war, involved the dispossession of indigenous peoples by an emerging \u2018mestizo\u2019 strata of the population. To compare this to the systemic trafficking of west Africans that served as the crucible of the New Afrikan nation is a bit misleading imo.

Thus the US government has been\r free to launch a war of aggression against a sovereign African nation\r (Libya), in which it armed, trained and helped organise a rebel force\r composed of Islamic fundamentalists, intelligence service assets,\r comprador capitalists and anti-black racists who have since publicly\r lynched hundreds of black Africans and ethnically cleansed large\r parts of the country of the same. In addition, Obama launched a\r proxy invasion of Somalia at the height of its worst drought in 60\r years and cut food aid to the country, thus condemning many tens of\r thousands to death by starvation. Even within the US itself, Obama\r publicly denies the significance of \u201crace\u201d to the disproportionate\r impact the current recession is having on Black people in terms of\r employment, health care and home ownership. Yet Black approval\r ratings of Obama remain between 80% and 90%.  \n>  \n>As Black Agenda Report writer Glen Ford has noted, \u201cObama,\r who arrogates to himself the right to kill designated enemies at will,\r is permitted by Black America to commit crimes against peace with\r political impunity... \\[and has\\] paid no domestic political price for his\r cruel barbarities against Africa\u2019s most helpless people, because Black\r America exacted none.\u201d This is a symptom not merely of political\r confusion and misleadership, as Ford suggests, but of the absence of\r a militant Black proletariat seeking an end to its exploitation and the\r overthrow of the capitalist state.\r\n\nThis passage has aged very poorly, and the \"even\" in the first sentence sticks out especially.

Can you definitely say there is an \"absence of a militant Black proletariat seeking an end to its exploitation and the overthrow of the capitalist state\"? That the masses do not consciously direct their violence toward the end of capitalism and the bourgeois state as a whole follows from spontaneous rebellion and the lack of a communist party that would organize them.

Especially because his motivation for the book was settler-colonialism in Ireland. Since the bulk of the book is about wage differences between the first and the third world, you would think that would suffice for his discussion of the US in the present day, but he decides to make a specific argument about \"Black America.\" The argument he chooses to make is not one based on how the settler hierarchy of wages has changed in the US, but just a lazy page or two where black people are equated to Obama. To me, this just sounds like the kind of lazy third-worldism which takes for granted that there's no first-world proletariat even in oppressed nations without any social investigation. Maybe you could argue this is just poor word choice on his part or not representative of his thought, but I don't feel too charitable given his recent work.",

                    "body": "You'd get more out of reading Sam King's thesis than DWDC. King actually addresses Cope's argument on imperialism within the thesis:\n\n>To substantiate his view that global productivity is converging, Cope compares productivity in like for like commodities in agriculture and manufacturing, concluding that productivity is similar. It is true that in certain types of labour processes labour productivity is equal or close enough to equal\u2014such as sewing garments. This is the reason capitalists do move these labour processes to cheap labour locations.\n\n>However, this represents only one of the two key trends in the international labour division. It ignores the increasing concentration in the imperialist core of other types of labour tasks where productivity is not equal. Thus, even if we accept Cope's calculations that Third World agricultural labour is equally productive to First World labour in agriculture or selected other areas, this would in no way demonstrate that labour is equally productive in general. Cope makes passing mention of core \"technological advantage\" but this is separated from his main theoretical argument, from which it is excluded in favour of the contradictory postulate of converging productivity.\n\n>How then is value transferred? For Lauesen and Cope,\n\n>*The principal mechanisms for this transfer are the repatriation of surplus value by means of foreign direct investment, the unequal exchange of products embodying different quantities of value, and extortion through debt servicing.*\n\n>(...)\n\n>As Cope says,\n\n>*since the incredibly low wages of Third World nations do not result in a concomitantly high rate of profit* \\[for the capital employing this labour power - principally Southern firms - SK\\]*, international differences in wages are principally observed in prices.*\n\n>The first problem is that Southern-produced cheap labour goods have both high and low prices. Compare the iPhone to the $10 pair of jeans. If both these are assumed to contain mostly cheap labour, what explains their radical price divergence? Secondly, profit rates are not equal. What Lauesen and Cope seek to explain is not equal profits but core surplus-profits. If, as Cope says, productivity is now equal, and it is Southern capital that has best access to cheap labour, why can't it be the principal beneficiary? Thirdly, as Mandel (1972) pointed out in relation to the theory as originally articulated by Emmanuel and Amin, for their theory to work, capital would have to be constantly flowing into the South. Such capital outflow from the core would be a massive capital flight. Yet capital continues to concentrate in the core, not decamp en masse.\n\nIt sort of makes sense how Cope wound up at \"free trade principles,\" since even within DWDC the explanation for the reproduction of imperialism was theoretically poor, relying on an explanation that lay outside the realm of production:\n\n>Like other \"financialisation\" explanations, Cope does not explain how \"finance\", \"investment\" or \"exchange rates\" can bring about core monopoly domination in the absence of its productive domination. \"Domination of world trade\" on the other hand, clearly relies, in the long run, on what one has to trade. According to Cope, technology transfer is blocked not by any organic economic mechanism within the imperialist economy but only outside of the economy due to political intervention\u2014\"protectionism\".\n\nIf the problem is \"protectionism\" then \"free trade principles\" becomes an obvious solution.",

Going mad is unlikely to be this boring and consistent. I can't access the pdf (upload to libgen anyone...?) but the gist is: the rules based order and globalism (versus multipolar rogue capitalism) is the best way to end racial capitalism and labour arbitrage. So that's a bridge to his earlier work in a sense. I guess Mossad might have found his porn folder or something but this whole line of thinking is pointless.\n\nYou can find more than enough problems in his earlier work itself which could, and now has, lead to this. Of course those problems are also shared by the vast majority of Marxists who haven't disavowed Marxism yet. That is more depressing, and interesting, and hopeful, than trying to sniff out soulless careerist CIA Zionist rich kid vibes.\n\nSomething was going on even in his earlier Palgrave/Oxford stuff.

Yet for some reason consistently omitting a major point of their analysis which is the \\*absolute dependence\\* of temperate Europe on tropical resources not producible at all or insufficiently in Europe. It's not just about cheap resources but resources that cannot be produced at all. And unless their acquisition within the domain of capitalist production is costless, capitalism won't happen, both then and now.\n\nAlso doesn't mention that the Columbian Exchange caused pandemics and subsequent depopulation and weakening of indigenous societies which made the actual conquest and genocide following it possible. Both of those things rule out an innate \"power\" of capitalism that Europe acquired then used to dominate and plunder the world (and eventually redistributed to the proletariat back home).

If capitalism could simply displace its contradictions there would have been no war, Kautsky would have been right etc. The reverse is true, capitalism was able to operate and develop despite being untenable as a social system due to a historically unprecedented conjuncture of irresolvable internal and external contradictions. \\*It survived precisely because it did not, and could not, export those contradictions wholesale to the third world.\\* It was parasitic upon pre-capitalist modes of production which it changed and modified to its purposes, or introduced entirely new forms of non-capitalist exploitation (slavery), in the process rendering them likewise unsustainable and binding all people to a single global system in terminal crisis which can only be resolved by irreversibly breaking with the rule of Capital itself, and not just 'capitalism'.\n\nThose people in the first world who are net beneficiaries of imperialism are also, by definition, personifications of capital. Slave owners, not slaves. It doesn't matter whether they have to work for a living or just sip martinis all day. Just like it didn't matter that feudal lords had to fight and die in wars and sometimes even perform manual labour. Those first worlders that are exploited do not need to earn the same income as \\[commodified image of gritty tear-jerking third world poverty\\] in order to be exploited by capital. And distinguishing beneficiaries of exploitation from its victims isn't hard, even in a first world context. You don't need to understand an elephant's anatomy to know it's an elephant.\n\n'Divided world divided class':\n\n>Marx argues that under socialism, the principle of distribution is not one of precisely equal distribution of the social product to all citizens but, rather, \u201cfrom each according to her abilities, to each according to her work performed.\u201d As such, those who contribute more value to society through their labour may expect to receive more of the social product than those who contribute less ... by conceiving economics as a zero-sum game between haves and have-nots, strict egalitarianism as a kind of \u201ctheory of the production relations\u201d (as opposed to the theory of the productive forces criticized by anti-imperialist Marxism) is opposed to historical materialism.\\* The central thrust of the latter situates class struggle within an economic system conditioned by, and in turn conditioning, the development of the productive forces. Where these are maintained at a low level, the predominance of small-scale and individual units of production must tend to engender social inequalities and class divisions that may only be combated through high levels of state coercion.\n\n>Nonetheless, socialism undoubtedly aims towards conditions of international equality. Indeed, enduring inequality between peoples has been correctly and forcefully denounced by socialist theoreticians and politicians as a sure sign of national oppression and national exploitation, just as enduring inequality within socialist nations has been understood as signaling a material basis for the restoration of capitalism.\n\n'Capital':\n\n>The relation of a portion of the surplus-value, of money-rent . . . to the land is in itself absurd and irrational; for the magnitudes which are here measured by one another are incommensurable - a particular use-value, a piece of land of so many and so many square feet, on the one hand, and value, especially surplus-value, on the other. This expresses in fact nothing more than that, under the given conditions, the ownership of so many square feet of land enables the landowner to wrest a certain quantity of unpaid labour, which the capital wallowing in these square feet, like a hog in potatoes, has realized. But prima facie the expression is the same as if one desired to speak of the relation of a five-pound note to the diameter of the earth.\n\n>However, the reconciliation of irrational forms in which certain economic relations appear and assert themselves in practice does not concern the active agents of these relations in their everyday life. And since they are accustomed to move about in such relations, they find nothing strange therein. A complete contradiction offers not the least mystery to them.\n\nThe fact is that even under Cope's generic interpretation of the socialist principle of distribution according to Marx (even though contradicted by other things said by Marx), anything more than marginal inequality would become impossible if applied consistently. The only way to get around that conclusion is to tacitly replace equality i.e substantive equality with \"the stablest, most efficiently managed inequality\". Which is, despite all pretensions to the contrary, nothing more than capital's self-criticism, a phenomenon as old as capital. \"The reconciliation of irrational forms\".\n\nIt's down to whether one understands capitalism primarily as the latest phase of class struggle, development of productive forces etc, or as the crisis of capital (=unequal involvement in the management of society) as it relates to the unsustainable way those things necessarily unfold within capitalism. Opposition to \"capitalism\" solely on the grounds of political action is going to \"betray\" itself sooner or later, and there is no evidence to the contrary.",

Twitter is worse than I remember and all the Dengist \"content creators\" are feasting at the corpse. \n\nThe shame in all this is that Cope's work was actually useful, whereas Ness's work is typical academic filler (proudly endorsed by Richard Wolff). Since we're speculating, it's worth pointing out Ness has a stable academic job whereas Cope does not, unsurprising given the latter's work. I'll give JMP credit. He is also an insecure academic worker but his revisionism occured through actual practice. His work is pretty consistent, albeit not very good.",

I think work like Zak Cope does ID a lot of broad truths that the American left ignores, but there's some difficulties in fully representing these truths in a Marxist framework.",
