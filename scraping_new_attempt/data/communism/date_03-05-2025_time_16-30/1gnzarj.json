    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed that many  communists or Marxists online tend to pivot to liberal frameworks when discussing women\u2019s issues. This has come up in their responses to the 4B movement, a Korean movement that is often misunderstood as merely a \"sex strike.\" For example, many online communists respond by saying it\u2019s \"misogynistic\" to think that women are just used for pleasure, or argue that \"sex is something to be enjoyed.\" But this analysis seems to miss the bigger point: the movement critiques a capitalist system where women\u2019s labor, including emotional and sexual labor, is treated as a commodity. \n\nSuddenly, words like \"choice\" and \"personal freedom\" are used as if they\u2019re Marxist arguments\u2014yet in most contexts, these same people reject liberal individualism as antithetical to class analysis. Why is there this inconsistency?\n\nI have criticisms of the 4B movement myself and I understand the limitations of this individualistic approach but I feel many critiques miss the mark. The same pattern applies to issues around kink, pornography, prostitution, and plastic surgery, where the attitude is often, \"As long as it\u2019s her choice, it\u2019s fine.\"\n\nThis is just an online observation, as I\u2019m not part of an organization and I\u2019ve only recently started reading Marxist theory, so I admit I\u2019m not an expert\u2014I might even sound like the \"liberal\" I\u2019m critiquing! But my concern is that these popular online opinions might reflect real-world attitudes among Marxists, too. It\u2019s hard to dismiss this as purely an internet phenomenon when these views are shared by real people with real accounts, not bots.\n\nI hesitated to post this because the obvious answer might be that these people\u2019s Marxism isn\u2019t authentic. As a beginner, I know it may sound presumptuous to question others  but it feels off, especially since they apply Marxist thought consistently in other areas. it\u2019s with women\u2019s issues where the inconsistency arises.\n\nSo, is this just an online phenomenon, or do these responses reflect real-world Marxist views? How can those who criticize capitalism for commodifying everything defend 'choice' in women\u2019s issues without questioning the structures that shape those choices. ",

            "body": "the easy answer is that a lot of male communists engage in patriarchal revisionism because they want the subordination of women to continue. but on the flip side, first world women constitute a gender aristocracy due to the benefits of imperialism (including patriarchal power) that lends itself to an alliance with the traditional gender oppressors, including under the guise of \"feminism\" which often throws oppressed women under the bus. an example on the subject of sex work is that a well-paid and legally secure sex worker might also benefit from the \"choice\" rhetoric. if a split between the gender aristocracy and the traditional gender oppressors were to seriously occur, it could be progressive *if* it was in political alliance with third world proletarian women. this isn't the case with Korea's 4B movement, which is currently about aiming for higher oppressor nation status but \"independent\" from men. I am doubtful it would end up much better if 4B tactics were seriously applied in amerikkka, especially since this discussion is occurring along the lines of imperialist parties (although if anything could be said to have been actually determined policy-wise from the election, it would be the future welfare of the gender aristocracy). however, MIM Theory 2-3 mentions a progressive Maoist strand that emerged in political lesbianism so it isn't impossible I suppose.",

Don't have sources for this at the moment, unfortunately, since most of what I read was several years ago when I was still a \"queer theory\" revisionist or hearsay from Korean transfeminine acquaintances, but I can look for some if it interests anyone. So not only is 4B not in alliance with third world proletarian women, it also explicitly rejects alliance with perhaps the most gender-oppressed group among the first-world gender-aristocracy in South Korea. \n\nI'd be interested in u/smokeuptheweed 's thoughts on this, since I know he has talked about both queer/feminist movements and the state of the left in South Korea at length in the past (no pressure, smoke, I'm sure you're a busy guy and ultimately 4B is no different than other pseudofeminist movements despite being temporarily on the front burner).",

The timing of this movement, especially after the ongoing genocide in Gaza really emphasises  the disconnect between the struggles of women in imperialist nations and the broader global struggles against imperialism. The movement maybe purposefully ignores the systemic violence and oppression faced by women in colonised regions. In places like Gaza where women\u2019s conditions are inhumane and 70% of civilians killed are women and children, this prioritization of self-focused \u201cempowerment\u201d seems particularly disconnected. Many of these women in the West likely support the Democratic Party, which is complicit in carrying out this genocide. they don\u2019t care about the global impact of their actions, focusing instead on their own interests.\nBut I think this is something you already know I just wanted to share my thoughts also. anyways this kind of critique of the 4b movement is what I was looking for but didn\u2019t find in online communist spaces.",

I frankly don't know much about the composition of the labor aristocracy in South Korea, so I'm speaking more towards the upsurge in 4B sentiment in the States, but in a country where the significant majority of the population is petit-bourgeois and thus the vast majority of activism is petit-bourgeois in nature, it makes sense that both \"now that we can't have abortions, we should reject males entirely; we can reach female liberation by abstaining from sex\" and the flipside of \"abstaining from sex isn't going to fix anything, you dumb broads, you should be having good sex for fun\" are at their core deeply individualist and idealist (even though the former pretends to be a mass movement and the latter pretends to be based in historical materialism).\n\nAnd it's good that a good discussion here could get going. What I want to know more of - which is why I tagged in a user who I know has talked about conditions in Korea in the past - is why Korean feminism and Amerikan feminism are so radically different in their (ultimately reformist) approaches to liberation in the context of sexuality and family.\n\n>especially since they apply Marxist thought consistently in other areas. it\u2019s with women\u2019s issues where the inconsistency arises\n\nDo they? I believe these are people who have studied Marxism and can recite revolutionary history and the impetus behind different developments in Marxism, but I'd be surprised if anyone who understands, say, the class structure of imperialism today, or the development of gender (beyond just repeating what Engels said in OotF), was also going around saying that porn is fine if a woman chooses to do it.",

No offense to King but as long as core countries still control the crucial technology in semiconductor making (and other seemingly advanced technology that the imperial core abandoned it because it was no longer profitable or it couldn't be monopolized) then we can forget everything about occupied Korea and Taiwan being part of \"imperialist\" countries. The only time an Asian country has ever been ascended to imperialism is Japan which wasn't possible without colonialism in Korea and Taiwan. \n\nIs south Korea benefited from U.S.-Japanese imperialism in many ways? Yes, but its relationship to core countries is nothing like British financial imperialism in relations to US imperialism. Poland and Lithuania's GDP per capita are $53,624 and $51,627 respectively, nearly higher than Japan's one. Are they \"imperialist\" or it's just a side effect of \"nearshoring\"?",

Perhaps I\u2019m misusing the term \u201cgender aristocracy\u201d? I don\u2019t have an excellent grasp on what it means (what differentiates it from petit-bourgeois feminism in essence).\u00a0 It\u2019s my understanding that, though SK is not an imperialist country, it has a not insignificant labor aristocracy of its own (not comparable to the vastness of the one in Amerika, though). This is based largely off of GDP and wage statistics, like how MIM originally formulated their proof of Amerikan superprofits being so prevalent. Is this incorrect?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI know that wages are a very flawed determinant of superprofits but this sun recognizes very well that the average Amerikan wage couldn\u2019t be around 60k a year without vast amounts of superprofits extracted from the Global South, and the average wage in SK is a little more than half of that. I would be interested in further writings on South Korea not being a first world country, specifically taking into account its relationship with Amerika.\n\nE: Looking back at my notes and searching this sub, both King and Cope classified South Korea as a first world country, though not part of the imperial core. Still, South Korea is in a very particular position with regards to imperialism and in particular dependency on the U$, so I don\u2019t think that should be taken for granted. Nevertheless I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s incorrect to say that they have a significant labor aristocracy and large petit-bourgeois, and that that influences politics \u2014 including the 4B movement \u2014 over there much as it does in the States.",

The reason why men constantly downplay/ignore the role of patriarchy is because addressing it would challenge their relations with women. So maybe I think this mostly post came from a place of frustration because Proletarian women are constantly told that proletarian men are our allies, and we\u2019re encouraged to look for solidarity. It\u2019s hard to see them as so when they have a vested interest in our subordination. \nLike they do not hate celibacy because it\u2019s an individualistic approach but the fact that they do not have easy sexual access to women. \n\nThe gender aristocracy theory I\u2019ve heard of and do not understand too well but in context with the 4b movement I think it makes a lot of sense. Since the 4B movement is a relatively small group of women who mostly operate online, and based on some of their demands, it seems more about gaining a seat at the table rather than liberating women as a whole.\nAnd Idk their lack of TRUE care for women is shown again with their transphobia.",

So I wouldn't necessarily assume that when leftists are invoking liberal feminist rhetoric to normalize sex work, that it's because they buy sex per se.

Porn just involves a proxy, but presumably it depicts what the viewer would do themselves or they wouldn't be watching it. Even if it's not a reflection of that, they are still effectively paying for it to be done to a real person. Porn isn't made to cater to the fantasies of the models, so there's no plausible deniability in terms of accountability. I suppose porn is more of a crowdfunded model but we're splitting hairs at that point because it's all self-reinforcing. There's no argument that participation is \"harmless\".\n\n\n> But I think that a possibility of direct donations plays an important part here, since you are not buying already produced commodity, but you are given an opportunity to directly influence. I think this is as close to \u201cregular\u201d prostitution as it gets, you are essentially watching a video in real time.\n\n\nYeah, this is what I was getting at. I still think it's different than in-person prostitution because the remote nature of it ostensibly protects the worker's right to withdraw consent or refuse certain acts so there is no immediate threat of violence. My understanding is most camgirls are \"self-employed\" but I may be wrong about that.\n\n\nOnlyFans can certainly just consist of a model uploading things that she has complete control over, but it's usually more like camming on a time delay. The models usually have \"menus\" and take requests from their \"patrons\". But the same principle applies, that hopefully they feel they have more autonomy over what they choose to do.\n\n\nYour last example is definitely challenging. There's a pretty big problem with pedophilia/ephebophilia in Western society. I've actually written a lot about this before, specifically how it and the emphasis on women being very thin are manifestations of fetishized female subservience. So that is sort of parallel to the sex trade, which obviously is also about possessing and dominating women both literally and through eroticized fantasy.\n\n\nYour example sits at sort of the intersection of these things. I think there's a lot of blame to be laid on the sex trade for things like self-commodification via social media, influencer culture, etc. You'll notice these are highly gendered ways of interacting with media \u2013 obviously there's a lot of cultural programming women undergo basically from birth that rewards objectification, conforming to the male gaze, etc. I would say it's actually extremely difficult for women to develop a sense of self-worth that is not tied to objectification and performance. We are at a point now where it is being sold as liberatory if you do it to yourself. I think this is an unavoidable consequence of growing up in a society that has normalized sex and bodies as commodities. Even the way we interact with things like Instagram, even if it's not explicitly sexual, very much feels like a form of prostitution. You're not selling your body, but you're also not selling your body with sex work. The body is not saleable as a discrete entity, it is as much you as anything else. Sex work and this type of performance on social media are both examples of commodifying abstractions of oneself \u2013 the abstraction of the body as a neutral object in the former, and the abstraction of a mythological self in the latter. Both require dehumanization, by oneself and by the audience/consumer, in order to rationalize the existence of the commodity \u2013 you have to divorce the human from the product, and since the product is a manifestation of a whole person, you can't do that without negating their humanity. So the logic of it is quite the same.\n\n\nI also think the woes of \"modern dating\" are an expression of the same \u2013 under capitalism and patriarchy, women don't benefit from casual sex at all. Female pleasure is not a defining element of our conception of sex and women assume all the material and social costs of sex, so there's very little incentive even for women who enjoy it in theory. \"Hookup culture\" is just an extension of sex as a type of transaction \u2013 it is not sex on mutually respectful terms (which can still be casual) which makes it demeaning. This is a pretty damning argument against sex work as part of a healthy society, because it shows that women being reduced to sex objects is not something that can be \"contained\" within the sex trade. It undeniably influences our cultural attitudes about sex. Men do not need to actively engage with prostitution or pornography to internalize these attitudes, nor do women.\n\n\nYoung women are also conditioned to engage with and even eroticize attention from older men. Again, there's a dialogue between \"real life\" and porn \u2013 dd/lg, \"teen\", school girls. There are entire swaths of the internet where young girls are exposed to and participate in romanticizing abuse (\"fawn\" culture, Lolita, etc.). Sorry if this is darker than you wanted to know \u2013 I was a very online teenage girl and this stuff was everywhere. I definitely interacted with tons of total pervs, too, but at the time thought I was empowered by \"seducing\" these men, that I was in control of the situation (obviously I was not). It's really so disgustingly normalized, I definitely think it's as urgent of an issue as the sex trade itself.\n\n\nAnyway, this is all a really long-winded way of saying that I think none of these issues would exist, or at least be this prevalent, in a society where sex and women's bodies as commodities was unimaginable. I just really don't see how you can get around it being dehumanizing, there's so much evidence of how it has infiltrated the way we conceptualize sex. It's also frustrating to have this reduced to \"sex negstivism\" as if the idea that sex should be mutually pleasurable and respectful is at all a reactionary concept. There's still people that think women don't enjoy sex for biological essentialist reasons or that the female orgasm is a myth. It is not only totally normal for men to make executive decisions about sex acts without ever experiencing any curiosity about their partners desires, but men rabidly defend their \"right\" to do so (see: Aziz Ansari's \"bad date\", affirmative consent as a \"mood killer\", etc). Most women I know like sex just as much as men, there's just very little pleasure to be extracted when you are only ever secondary to male pleasure at best, and just something to be abused at worst.\u00a0",

With regards to one's day to day life, the correct orientation is to not harm the interests of the masses, recognize that individual practices will never be a path to liberation, and not let one's sex life (whatever that looks like) be an impediment to one's revolutionary organizing. If this seems convoluted or confusing it's because it is; neither \"men should abstain from sex\" nor \"there's no ethical sex under capitalism so do whatever you want\" is a Marxist answer.\n\nE: Actually never mind, you don't seem to have engaged with Marxism, or even the broader ideas of \"socialism\" or \"communism\", outside of what it would mean for your sex life, and as another user pointed out, you have a deeply reactionary view of marriage. Regardless of what I said above, the world would be a better place if *you personally* abstained from sex forever (or at least until you learned how to treat women as human beings). You will not get sent to a gulag for desiring sex with women under communism, but you *would* for saying things like\n\n>It's crazy how even children are being inducted into this c\\*\\*ked postmodern ass mindset. Men saying men are inherently evil for being sexual is turning men into ball-less losers that can't turn a woman on to save their life. Women ask for impotent guys to challenge them, not so you can white knight for them on reddit.\n\nI think deep down you *know* that your concept of sexuality is inherently linked to misogyny, and you're here looking for either soothing from other users that this should be allowed, or for someone to say something that you think is ridiculous like \"women should be lesbians and men should be celibate\" so you can reject communism as just another \"cucked postmodern-ass mindset\".\n\nE^(2): Before the person I was responding to got banned, they started pretending that they'd been playing a character (for the last... six months?) so that people on r/communism could properly analyze them and respond to their hypothetical points, congratulating me on a good psychoanalysis and a thorough response to the misogynistic character that they'd been playing. One of the weirder manifestations of the internet-persona revealing too much about the real life person, I guess. Sometimes I wonder how hard it is for former reactionaries or trolls to either just say \"oh yeah I used to be shitty in the past but I'm learning\", or to make a new Reddit account. It's got to be embarrassing to see your own vile nature analyzed to clearly that you feel the need to pretend as though your real-life self was just a LARP of a bigot.",

            "body": "I\u2019m not sure what the point of this discussion is when it is not discussing any serious political force at all but an abstract of \u201conline communists.\u201d What political line does this group represent? What political setting are they come from? Most people online aren\u2019t communists, communism is not some belief system that one picks up after reading two books and finding it rad. Most people in these circles neither join communist parties nor put themselves in class struggle in any way. So I\u2019m not sure what purpose is served by discussing the political habits of this group. What is interesting is if communist parties have adopted post modern terminology (which is what your complaint seems to be about, not liberalism).\n\nAnd one definitely finds this to be the case. Revisionist parties are quick to adopt either identitarian terms or post modern intersectional ones when it comes to the question of women\u2019s liberation or the question of gender and sexuality. But even Maoists are guilty of allowing the invasion of post modernism into their framework. Usage of the word proletarian feminism as some sort of proletarian reclamation of an identitarian trend and using Anuradha Ghandy of all people to legitimise it is a historic sin that American Maoists have unleashed onto the entire world. Others, like K Murali, have chosen to give tacit support to it while downplaying its differences from the orthodox line of women\u2019s liberation in a bit of sophistry that really did not receive any criticism. Similarly, the Filipino Maoists allowed same sex marriages within their party and went further and declared the revolution has no gender in a pamphlet. The question of same sex marriages is settled within the realm of democratic rights itself and hardly requires much elaboration but the CPP\u2019s declaration contains no explanation of what they term as gender, why will the revolution have no gender, are they hinting at a gender less society, what is the basis of this oppression etc. It completely relies on postmodern sensibilities and definitions of these terms. I\u2019m contrast groups like MIM have attempted to separately define these terms and detach them from post modernism. \n\nAnother trend, the reverse of this, is over emphasis on patriarchy, something which you have also done in one of your comments here. Proletarian and peasant women aren\u2019t told that men from their classes are their allies, they know that they are. People from imperialist countries or those influenced by imperialist ideology are the fastest to ignore the real ramifications of Mao\u2019s Hunan Report or the experiences of Dandakaranya Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sanghathan or Nari Mukti Sangh, both organisations comprised solely of peasant and proletarian women. The struggle against patriarchy is one of the facets of class struggle, it is not something separate from it nor superior to it. When peasants encircle the houses of landlords, the women do not sit there and talk of how their husbands are abusive towards them when they know that it is the landlord who makes them work for free in his house, pays them hardly anything for their labour and also stakes a claim to their bodies per his desire. It is only after a period of advancement of class struggle that this issue of internal patriarchy within class comes up strongly, though organisations of peasant and proletarian women often engage in various efforts to diminish it through education campaigns from an earlier period.\n\nThe reason for why this trend comes up also has a class basis and that is the petite bourgeoisie. This class is the first to abandon struggle and sit on the sides ruminating about how it is going to fail and how there must be something wrong with itself and the class struggle from within. It is then quick to ignore class lines and find unity on lines of \u201cinnate differences\u201d such as sex, relying upon biological determinism to do so. Hence all the garbage about the Self. They will then stake the success of movements on these lines and split the people completely ignoring the principal contradiction. Best example of this is Dr. Ambedkar splitting the Bombay Mill Workers strike on lines of caste and finding solace among the British imperialists over the brahmanical CPI. Also, the 4B movement is a good example of this political trend\u2019s degeneracy in the present. Others have already gone into it so I\u2019ll not elaborate further but there is a good difference between the identitarian movements I\u2019m describing from the first half of the 20th century to stuff like 4B and that is the question of liberation. Radical feminism, Ambedkarite caste annihilation, gay liberation activism, all these identitarian groups focused on liberation and struggle for it, during which they allied with Marxism. But the petite bourgeoisie\u2019s politics has degenerated so much since then that the question of liberation is gone, choice and existence itself is enough. 4B is dubbed radical feminist but that is a disservice to radical feminism or the trend of lesbian feminism. The current upholders of post modern identitarianism like 4B or its American sympathisers post Donald Trump have nothing to say about liberation and will always end up in the camp of fascism unlike their predecessors who had a coherent ideological framework.\n\nI\u2019m sure this didn\u2019t answer your question, since I shifted the entire basis of your question away from the people you were discussing but I would rather that people discuss real movements and political formations here over the incoherent group of sympathisers who claim to be communists online.",

                            "body": "The American Maoists have popularised this term called proletarian feminism. Anuradha Ghandy wrote the pamphlet Philosophical Trends in the Feminist Movement where she traced the historic development of feminist movements. In the last two pages, she sums up the entire thing and makes an overall critique of why the feminist movement failed, only served the petite bourgeois in some cases and why the Marxist understanding on women\u2019s liberation should be focused on. In a classic case of Derridean deconstruction, the Maoists in America somehow interpreted this to mean that Com Ghandy was advocating for a feminist movement from the proletariat\u2019s end. The foundation of this crap is rooted in what Plekhanov in Fundamental Problems of Marxism had labelled \u201cattempts to supplement Marxism with one philosopher or the other\u201d in that the petite bourgeois intellectuals have a habit of trying to \u201ccomplete\u201d Marxism by using non-Marxist thought to fill in what they consider the blanks. Since the American left in general was mired first in identitarian liberation struggles since the 1920s which only intensified under Maoist influence during the GPCR period, it didn\u2019t shed these petite bourgeois tendencies and came up with this theory of proletarian feminism. In actuality, there is nothing to actually define this term. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m remembering correctly but MIM has some theoretical work on this though from my memory, it doesn\u2019t elaborate much on what this theory of proletarian feminism is either. The attempt is essentially to push back the identitarian movements from their current iteration within post modernist intersectional realm back to the days of identitarian liberation struggles. The difference between the two is that the first iteration saw the identities as stable social categories while the post modernist intersectional turn made all the identities fluid. If you read the write ups of groups like Revolutionary Maoist Coalition in the USA on proletarian feminism for example, they talk of situating women\u2019s liberation struggle within the Maoist struggle against abolition of private property (which has been the Marxist line on the women\u2019s question since Engels) but talk of \u201cactionable unity\u201d and forming women\u2019s organisations for self defence and actions. Who is this unity with, but pre-existing feminist groups which in the present stage are post modernists? How can you form these women\u2019s organisations without developing a class line on the question? And if the ideological basis of this question is what Engels laid out clearly then why the hell does Marxism need feminism to complete it? Practically, all of this ideological ineptness manifests in petite bourgeois women\u2019s organisations which are mired in post modernism claiming to practice a brand of Maoism devoid of \u201crevolutionary sexism\u201d or \u201csemi-feudal patriarchy\u201d (often becoming excuses to practice separatism) like Women Against Sexual Violence and State Repression in India or BASO. The organisations like Half the Sky and that social media influencer Esperanza in the US who unsurprisingly repopularized the term proletarian feminism during the COVID-19 period also seem to be an organisation of this type.\n\nK Murali in his interview with these people fanned the flames by equating women\u2019s liberation and proletarian feminism as the same thing and talked of how the participation of proletarian women in bourgeois feminist struggles showed the possibility of a proletarian feminism. Hence the victory lap for this trend.",
