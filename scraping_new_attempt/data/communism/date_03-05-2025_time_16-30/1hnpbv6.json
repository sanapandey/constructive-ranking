    "selftext": "Recently i was reading farm to factory a reinterpretation of the soviet industrial revolution bt Robert C Allen and so far it's a great read \n\nBut i stumbled in chapter 3 between bukharin vision for the economy who believed that the state should support all the agricultural sector (by providing them with cheap machines fertilizers) including the kulaks but at the same time encouraging collectivisation he believed that eventually kulaks would run out of money while at the same time the state enhanced both agriculture and industry \nOn the other hand preobrazhensky belived that the state should focus only in rapid industrialization by offering unfavorable trade deals to peasensts and kulaks and take their surplus enforcing most of them to go to urban areas which would enchance industry even more and destroy the kulaks stalin eventually adopted the later policies.\nPlease correct me if i got it wrong also which policy do you think was the better one ",

By empowering the poor and middle peasants to struggle against the kulaks through the process of collectivization, the USSR was simultaneously able to increase the living standards of the peasants and increase the rate of industrial development. That is because the relations of production are primary, not the forces of production. The issue with both options you've presented is they do not differentiate within the peasantry itself and treat it as a single class, either a single class that needs the leadership of the kulaks given the level of production or a single class to be repressed because of its backwardness under the leadership of the kulaks.\n\nAllen is unable to understand this in his bourgeois framework and it appears you've accepted it wholly.",

                            "body": "As you point out in the OP, Bukharin's plan was to allow the free development of capitalism among the peasants which would inevitably coalesce into collectives because of their efficiency. Remember that collectives are not in-themselves socialist, they still produce commodities for the market. \n\nHowever Stalin understood that the kulaks would prevent the development of collectives if not actively struggled against and this required the active participation of the peasant masses, something impossible if they are sacrificed to the \"necessity\" of capitalist exploitation. Further, even if collectives of some kind were encouraged under a market system (as in Yugoslavia) they would only reproduce the inefficiency of capitalism because they would be lead by kulaks and go to their accumulation rather than the social good. This is both an objective and subjective problem, since the enriching of the kulaks is a material incentive rather than a moral one. Again, what's missing from your framework is that when human beings are empowered to work for the collective good, they produce more. Top-down schemes of social necessity and objective stages are based on a fundamentally flawed ideological preconception. It is why Allen cannot distinguish the socialist and revisionist periods and has to come up with a technocratic explanation for events rather than taking the actual people at their word who explained in detail exactly what they were doing and why (including revisionists).",

Both plans were bad because they were based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of historical causality which removed human agency and fetishized social relations as given properties of nature.\n\n>i believe bukharin plan was better imagine if the state offered incentives to the collectives that would give them an edge against the kulaks who eventually would find no option but to join the collectives\n\nYou don't have to believe, this is exactly what happened in Yugoslavia and most of Eastern Europe. It didn't work because of the perverse incentive of producing for the market on your own plot vs. producing for the collective. Without abolishing private property no one would ever join a collective when being a kulak was still an option (or would join only long enough to accumulate capital and buy land). It's also not clear how land would even be acquired in the Russian case since the best land was already owned by kulaks, unlike Eastern Europe where the Nazis were kind enough to kill everyone and take land for themselves rather than just the absentee landlords. Finally, there is no social benefit to maintaining kulaks and a significant cost. Do you know what a Kulak is? They are a peasant who exploits the labor of other peasants. By allowing them to exist, you are also responsible for the peasants they exploit and become the enforcer of that exploitation in the last instance. Stalin believed that abolishing this class had to be put off until the dictatorship of the proletariat could win and he was right. But this came at a significant cost, the NEP created massive problems and the Kulaks violently resisted their abolition as a class, they did not join the collectives because they had \"no option.\"",

It's easy for you to tell peasants to accept their exploitation now because you're not the one being exploited. In fact, you're not even in power so you have no responsibility to anyone. I want you to tell a peasant in China to their face who is living in poverty because the government took their land and gave it to a developer that \"eventually\" it will pay off for society as a whole and maybe them if they don't die first.\n\nStalin argued with Trotsky against immediate collectivization. But he understood the costs of doing so. You're just fantasizing about \"pacifism.\" It's not worth taking seriously and, again, has little to do with the OP. Bukharin may have been a revisionist but his argument was practical, no one cared about the moral right of kulaks. If you want to say that you think the famine of the 1930s was caused by overly rapid collectivization just say so. You would be wrong but at least you're making an argument. Instead you refuse to even grasp the logic of Stalin's policies and have yet to acknowledge that the OP is factually wrong about Stalin's policies in relation to the alternatives (which it's hard to believe I have to explain -Stalin was actually there and argued with Bukharin and Preobrazhensky in real time. You really think he was unable to articulate the difference between his policies and theirs and only this random bourgeois academic knows?)",

My attitude towards liberal morality is the same as Malcolm X's towards white anti-racists. He was totally willing to accept any who lived up to their ideas as John Brown had done. He never met anyone who did but he did meet a lot of white liberals who were very concerned with looking anti-racist and seeing themselves as a good person.",

It has nothing to do with the nazis, the primary consideration was whether the dictatorship of the proletariat could win based on the political strength of the collectives, the level of food production, and state owned industry. These were practical concerns and the plan was always to build socialism as quickly as possible. Stalin's famous quote about industrializing in 10 years is from 1931, before the Nazis came to power. Internationally the primary concern was Poland and the Great depression more generally, the former made the NEP era national policy more dangerous and the latter shut the USSR from international trade. Already by the late 1920s total collectivization was the plan. Obviously fascism was a concern (though Japan was probably the greater concern until the late-1930s) but overemphasizing it is a liberal fantasy for the obvious reason that bourgeois liberalism was equally a threat to the USSR, as had been shown by the multinational invasion during the civil war.\n\nThe implication that the construction of socialism in the USSR was premature but necessary because of fascism and therefore regrettable in its excesses if understandable is revisionist garbage. The construction of socialism in the USSR was the active empowerment of the masses in mastering their own lives and constructing a democratic society which incentivized them to produce more and better for the social good. Regression to market \"necessity\" after the death of Stalin in the USSR and then China has only produced immense suffering and superexploitation to little gain. That is why the USSR was about to beat advanced capitalist Germany whereas revisionist China was embarrassed in Cambodia.",
