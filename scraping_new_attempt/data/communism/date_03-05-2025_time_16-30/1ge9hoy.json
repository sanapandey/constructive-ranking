You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The rest of Reddit would have you believe israel has destroyed Hamas and Hezbollah and its only a matter of time till either of them surrender. Just the other day Harris responded to someone at a rally that since Sinwar is dead the opportunity for \"peace\" on Zionist terms is soon.\n\nIsrael cant sustain long term warfare like this. They havent faced a war like this since the War of Attrition with Egypt. It is immensely more costly to wage an offensive war, and is immensely more costly to defend against cheaper missiles. \n\nIsrael is bogged down in Gaza, hasnt begun a full scale ground invasion of Lebanon, will not be able to counter the Houthis, and will not be able to counter Iran which will only increasingly target israel.\n\nIm not saying this to be hopeful and overzealous that israel will be destroyed tomorrow, we should always be critical.\n\nThis narrative needs to be demonstrated more, for too long the Palestinian resistance has been potrayed as just \"barely holding on\"",

Imperialism is a paper tiger, and does not have the same determination to win that the resistance naturally does and has demonstrated. \n\nIsraelis suffer much lower casualties but this depleets their moral much higher, causes social unrest and destroys the resolve of many to move into the settler colony (or move out of the colony to take their wealth and flee to safety). The security that the IDF aims to give is compromised. By the end of this war it is essentially guaranteed that Israel will have lost less people in the war. \n\nOne should not see that as a complete negative, but an advantage that it will take comparatively less to topple the top heavy zionist regime.",

The BNC would like one to believe that this is proof that [\"#BDS really works\"](https://bdsmovement.net/news/israels-genocide-against-palestinians-accelerating-its-economic-collapse) and ignores (or decries) those forces altogether. That marks a continuation of their function to erase the armed resistance (as was mentioned [earlier this year](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18jbhti/initial_investigations_into_the_u_propalestine/)) in order to try to legitimize their reformist strategy as leading the way. Its not just the work of the \"monopoly media\" as the article points out, but also is a mystification by the liberal left to prop up a facade of anti-imperialism while still furthering those illusions of imperialism.",

The level of violence in this conflict is higher and unignorable compared to before. Yet the Western left still manages to minimize Palestinian Resistance. There is no type of Solidarity movement similar to the openly Pro-ANC movements of the past.\n\nHalf of the Western left is still hesitant to adhere to the Singular Palestinian state. There was no one among the Left (not just the Western left) back in the day who would ever seek a 2 State Solution for South Africa, it would be political suicide. Nowadays, it's basically assumed unless an organization or movement makes it 100% clear that they support Partition/Segregation.",

At no point in the last year does it appear that the ability of the Resistance to fight the invaders has been diminished. They have no doubt lost fighters but others are stepping up. The tunnel system is intact and their production abilities appear to be maintained, this notion that the Resistance has been diminished much less nearly defeated is totally bunk.",
