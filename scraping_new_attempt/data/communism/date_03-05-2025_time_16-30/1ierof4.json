You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To be honest I haven't looked into them much further than this, but, though perhaps having room to grow, I would say it's obvious they aren't very advanced ideologically at the moment. I'm somewhat confident making this conclusion despite the low level of investigation because this is the case with most Marxist online study groups, online publications and content creators in the former Soviet countries with heavy social media presence I've encountered, whether Politsturm, Workers' Front of Ukraine, Red Yurt, Andrey Rudoy, etc. It seems like all these groups are at best stuck in the 1920s trying desperately to formally \"return\" to the Bolshevism of the time without the real essence and without any consideration for history and developments in capitalism and the communist movement and the science of Marxism since then. At least this specific group goes further and talks about analyzing up to the 1950s and tries to analyze the labor aristocracy in other articles of theirs but I'm still not particularly impressed. Overall though I wouldn't take an entirely dismissive attitude, if you're thinking of joining their study group and waging a struggle I can't tell you it'll be a waste of time for sure though you ought to beware of that possibility. In Russia there do also exist the \"Maoists\" but considering they're massive Zionists I can't tell you you'd be much better off joining and struggling among them than with these people.\n\n\nEdit: https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1f2uo15/comment/lkefi5b/\n\n\nYou've been familiar with them for about half a year at least so now you tell us what you think.",

Their main idea is of \"scientific centralism\" which believes that a potential communist party in Russia should not be democratic in structure but meritocratic where people are selected based off of their knowledge of Marxism - like a sort of church of Marxism.",

            "body": "The Lenin Crew is a pretty interesting group. They\u2019re keeping Marxist-Leninist ideas alive in Russia while trying to adapt them to modern conditions. Their articles are well-written and offer strong critiques of capitalism, imperialism, and even some of the mistakes of past socialist states. Using an English name seems like a deliberate choice to connect with international leftist movements, which is a good move given how global capitalism operates.\n\nThey\u2019re doing important work in a tough political environment, but no group is perfect. If you\u2019re reading their stuff, keep thinking about how their ideas fit into the bigger picture of socialist struggle. Solidarity with their efforts, though.  Rebuilding a revolutionary movement in Russia is no small task.",
