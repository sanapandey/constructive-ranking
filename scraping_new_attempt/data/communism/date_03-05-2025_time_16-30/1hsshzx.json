    "selftext": "I feel like maybe this is controversial (or maybe it\u2019s a cold take?), but it seems that essentially the aim of the New Deal was to create a wealthier, \u201csuperior\u201d white race. This is based on the systematic exclusion of Black people from the benefits of New Deal programs and the remnants we see today in the massive wealth disparity between white people and people of other races? \n\nI also recognize that it was specifically a response to increasing unrest, increasing class consciousness, and the rise of a socialist alternative in the Soviet Union.

TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

The general idea of the new deal economic policies was to revive the capitalist-imperialist system through Keynesian \u201cprime the pump\u201d public spending and state intervention. The result was the modern labor aristocracy and the destruction of anything resembling a progressive labor movement. It\u2019s not a 1 to 1 but in many ways this mirrors the economic projects undertaken in nazi germany and fascist Italy around the same time",

So did internal NRA studies. And the President himself expressed interest in bringing the programs of \"that admirable Italian gentleman\" to America.",

But their split is noteworthy and relevant since their disagreements centered around the New Deal itself.\n\nBut, for one, collective bargaining was completely banned under the Nazis and expanded via the AFL and CIO during the New Deal. The NLRA also wouldn't have passed without the AFL and something equivalent to that in Nazi Germany would have been the stuff of fantasy. The AFL was free to criticize the FDR administration while that was not tolerated whatsoever in the Arbeitsfront. Also, importantly, the AFL predated the New Deal as an independent organization while the Arbeitsfront was a sham labor organization completely invented by the Nazi party after they raided all of the independent unions, often killing their leaders.\n\nYou could definitely argue that FDR co-opted the AFL, but its relationship to the state seems dramatically different to me.",

A group of major capitalists, headed by Irenee DuPont (of DuPont Chemicals) and the J.P. Morgan banking interests, set the conspiracy in motion in 1934. The DuPont family put up $3 million to finance a fascist stormtrooper movement, with the Remington Firearms Co. to arm as many as 1 million fascists. Gen. Douglas MacArthur was recruited to ensure the passive support of the U.S. Army. The plan was to seize state power, with a captive President Roosevelt forced to officially turn over the reins of government to a hand-picked fascist \"strong-man.\n\n>As their would-be Amerikan Fuhrer the capitalists selected Gen. Smedley Butler, twice winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor and retired Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. But after being approached by J.P. Morgan representatives, Gen. Butler went to Congress and exposed the cabal. An ensuing Congressional investigation confirmed Gen. Butler's story. With the conspiracy shot down and keeping in mind the high position of the inept conspirators, the Roosevelt Administration let the matter just fade out of the headlines.\n\n[https://readsettlers.org/ch7.html#3](https://readsettlers.org/ch7.html#3)\n\nYou may have already read Settlers but he has a chapter that discusses The New Deal. I haven't taken the time to study fascism and it's origins enough to say if The New Deal is fascist itself; though how the New Deal became financially possible appears to have fascist elements (for example, the Mexican Repatriation).\n\nThe \"Business Plot\" is what the above passage refers to with the plan being to install a fascist dictatorship via coup d'\u00e9tat. The plan never materialized of course but it seems a section of the bourgeoisie looked to a fascist political movement as a legitimate solution to the political and economic turmoil at the time.",
