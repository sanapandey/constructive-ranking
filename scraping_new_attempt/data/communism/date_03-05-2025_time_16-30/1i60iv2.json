You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "This is amazing news. Peltier's poor health, the fact that his innocence (or at least his trial being stacked against him) is now being recognized even by bourgeois news sources, and his importance as a veteran of AIM mean that this is a small but not unsubstantial win. Of course, all the honor should go to Peltier, the fellow veterans of the AIM movement still protesting for him, and secondarily to the radical (though not revolutionary) lawyers fighting to defend him through the courts. This wasn't an act of kindness from Biden, it was an act of desperation, as his administration sees that losing parts of the radlib settler contingent over concerns about Palestine, policing and prisons, and transgender bourgeois-democratic rights is a significant blow to the Demokkkratic party. This move - the symbolic freeing of an elderly veteran - is an attempt to appease those very people who he lost for his genocidal tendencies.\n\nNevertheless, it should be remembered that Peltier had a significant case made for his innocence, and very little evidence substantiating his involvement in the (justified) killing of two occupying FBI agents. This is likely why he is having his sentence commuted (he's going *home,* not going *free*) while people like Mumia are still locked up in prison. Would the radical-liberals rallying behind his case have rallied as hard if he, like many political-prisoner Palestinians and BLA veterans, had actually murked those agents in order to defend AIM and the rez? I doubt it. But we, as communists, should. Too much of prisoner advocacy is centered around victims actually being innocent, being able to present the perfect victim. But sometimes those from oppressed nations *will* commit revolutionary violence, and that should be defended just as much.\n\nAbove all, may Leonard Peltier live out the rest of his life in peace, get treatment for his disabilities, and continue to inspire the oppressed people of the U$ to fight against it.",

PlayfulWeekend, you really should research each of these (but especially AIM and the BLA) beyond the Wikipedia pages too. I see you call yourself a Maoist; I don't know if you live in the U$ or not, but the national liberation movements of the late 20th century are perhaps the most important things that a Maoist in the states could possibly study after going through the basics of MLM.",
