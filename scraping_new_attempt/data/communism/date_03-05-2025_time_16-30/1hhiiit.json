    "selftext": "This might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe the approaches to the ethnic issue of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des \u00c9tats du Sahel are not good; in fact, I think it's something to criticize.\n\nTo begin with, the approach of Go\u00efta\u2019s government toward ethnic tensions in Mali is deeply problematic. Equating Azawadi rebels with terrorist groups is not only unjust but also undermines any chance of achieving a peaceful and negotiated solution. Additionally, the treatment of Tuareg, Arab, and Fulani communities leaves much to be desired, as it appears to prioritize repression over inclusion and respect for their rights. The decision to abandon the 2015 Peace Accords, originally designed to resolve these conflicts peacefully, and to launch a new offensive against Azawadi movements has further exacerbated the situation. This not only violates the promised autonomy of these regions but also jeopardizes any prospects for lasting reconciliation and stability. A path of dialogue that recognizes the legitimate demands of these communities and ensures fair treatment for all peoples in the country is essential. It is also worth emphasizing that the Azawadi people have a right to self-determination.\n\nAs for the government of Burkina Faso, I would prefer not to delve too deeply into the treatment of Fulanis under Traor\u00e9's government, but the gravity of their situation cannot be ignored. These communities face dire conditions and suffer widespread abuses by militias operating under the government\u2019s influence. One example of this is the indiscriminate attacks against the Fulanis. Fulanis endure systemic violence that undermines any claims of stability or justice by the state. The Nouna massacre stands as a stark example of this brutality.\n\nAlso I believe there is a troubling tendency among sectors of the Western left to fetishize the peoples of Africa (and others parts of the world) and some of their governments. While this often stems from good intentions, it oversimplifies the complexities of political and social struggles across the continent. From a Marxist perspective, it is crucial to approach these issues with critical and materialist analysis, taking into account class dynamics, economic structures, and internal contradictions that shape these societies.\n\nRomanticizing certain movements or governments, I'm speaking in generally not about the Sahel governments, not only obscures the struggles of working and peasant classes within these nations but also risks legitimizing power structures that often perpetuate oppression and exploitation. Instead of succumbing to idealizations, the left should practice concrete and rigorous solidarity, aligning itself with the working masses rather than ruling elites, who frequently operate within the constraints of global capitalism.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify, to avoid any misunderstandings, that I do not ignore the colonial legacy of France, especially in West Africa. This legacy continues to function as a structure of oppression that not only shaped artificial borders but also cemented inequalities and ethnic divisions that persist to this day. However, I chose to focus on the current policies of the governments, and perhaps it was a mistake not to mention this, as it was pointed out to me. Instead of addressing a historical overview, which I consider important but assume is generally known, I preferred to focus on the current issues.\n\nEdit 2: Another thing I should have to mention of the historical background is that since its independence, Mali has committed crimes against certain ethnic groups in the north, such as the borderline genocidal practices that took place in the early 1960s, just a few years after Mali's independence, which led to a rudimentary and improvised resistance in 1963 that was brutally crushed. These criminal practices by the Malian government, combined with the violence resulting from the insurgency, led to forced displacements and a wave of refugees. Many of them arrived in Algeria, which partly explains the sympathy for the Azawad rebels in that country.",

This is an essential point that I did not mention in my initial post. The legacy of colonialism is deeply ingrained in the political and ethnic tensions in the Sahel, and any materialist analysis would be incomplete if it doesn\u2019t address the historical and ongoing impact of French imperialism. I should have recognized this factor more explicitly, as it is key to understanding the structures of oppression that still affect these regions. Nonetheless, I chose to focus on the policies of the current governments, perhaps mistakenly, rather than providing a more general historical overview that I assumed most people would have relatively in mind.\n\nI understand that discussions on social media like this will not directly influence government decisions. My intention was to try to ground all the admiration I am seeing for the governments of the Sahel. I recognize that a more focused and analytical approach to the economic and political structures shaping these conflicts would have strengthened my argument. I will make sure to refine my analysis in the future.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that I have a critical perspective on the discourse of multipolarity, as well as the history of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, this was not my main objective in making this comment.\n\nI appreciate your feedback, as criticism is always welcome. it is necessary to strengthen what one thinks, holds, and practices.\n\nEdit: My position on the governments of the Sahel is that, far from being revolutionary governments, they are more expressions of militarized reformism. These governments, for better or for worse, do not seek to transform the existing relations of production; rather, they are content to manage the capitalist system under new conditions. I could even question their anti-colonial character, given their close ties with Russian and Chinese capital, which are no less imperialist in nature than Western capital. In fact, I believe these governments represent a continuity, in many ways, rather than a break, with the previous order, particularly regarding ethnic dynamics. In the case of Mali, these ethnic tensions are not only maintained, but have been amplified and used for political purposes. Additionally, the use of political violence by these regimes is highly questionable both in form and substance; there is an abuse of it.",

To me this is just the style of writing that students in the US have been conditioned to adopt for a long time.

Maybe it's a case where bad student writing has been used as a basis for training AI and then that AI is just spitting back out what it was trained on. AI certainly hasn't helped the situation, but this ties back into a greater structural crisis in American universities and education more broadly, predating AI.

The same with the usage of Vygotsky who has been watered down to just the zone of proximal development, yet his name shows up in educational government documents about scaffolding with everything interesting about him (like the fact that he was a communist) gone.\n\nSomething interesting I did get from that course was realizing just how much our educational system was modeled after the amerikkkans which has so far tied closely with the opening chapters of the Hundred Day War about Qinghua University. I can see a common thread between Qinghua and Sison's writings about his time in university (From On Culture, Arts, and Literature).\n\n\nI also like how Sison was able to draw out the contradiction immanent in the University such as the reactionary features:\n>\nThe University of the Philippines was established in 1908\nby a foreign power which had crushed the Philippine\nRevolution. The practical purpose of this new colonial power\nin founding this university was to brainwash and train a new\neducated elite to serve monopoly capitalist and local\nreactionary interests.\nAs the University of Sto. Tomas was to Spanish\ncolonialism, so has been the University of the Philippines to\nUS imperialism. As a medievalist religio-sectarianism has\nbeen the orientation of the UST, so has been an abstract\nliberalism\nthat\nof\nthe\nUP.\nThis\nabstract\nliberalism\ncamouflages the reality of US imperialism and promotes in\nparticular a coopted pro-imperialist type of liberalism that is\ndiametrically opposed to the revolutionary liberalism of the\nold democratic revolution of 1896.\n\n\nAnd the progressive features:\n\n>What is truly progressive now is that categorically anti-\nimperialist type of liberalism which appreciates the old\ndemocratic revolution, strives to continue and carry it\nforward and knows how to ally itself with proletarian\nrevolutionary thinking that informs the new democratic\nrevolution. This progressive type of liberalism has taken\nroots in the University of the Philippines among the students\nand faculty members. It is anti-imperialist and anti-feudal\nalthough it has no clear idea of the future beyond the new\ndemocratic revolution.\n\n\nAlso somewhat funny that this is literally happening again (originally published July 9, 1983):\n\n>The extreme oppressiveness and exploitativeness of the\nfascist dictatorship of the US-Marcos clique is coaxing the\nbroad masses of the Filipino people to wage armed\nrevolution. The struggle for national independence and\ndemocracy appears to be on the way of being completed\nbefore the end of this century.",

                                    "body": "I am not trying to lecture anyone, but rather to open up space to discuss issues that are often overlooked when we talk about the governments of the Sahel, such as ethnic violence. For instance, we cannot ignore the Nouna massacre, carried out by the VDP, a group allied with the government. While the government claimed it would investigate, two years have passed\u2014where are the results?\n\nLikewise, Mali's actions in the north, under the guise of its \"progressive nationalism\" and with Wagner's support, are deeply questionable. We cannot justify or ignore the suffering of so many people just because it goes against a common enemy. Take the events of August 25 this year, when Mali's government bombed a civilian marketplace, committing a war crime and killing innocent people. Once again, the government promised an investigation, but where are the perpetrators?\n\nI insist, the Azawadies have the right to self determination. They should have the possibility to choose their future. A comparison can be made with the situation that was in South Sudan, but this one is more complex.\n\nThe logic of showing apathy simply to avoid \"playing into the enemy's hands\" strikes me as ethically wrong and politically dangerous. We must criticize everything, including so-called progressive movements.\n\nIt's important to mention that the Syrian Communist Party supported Assad. What do I mean with this? While it is important to consider what parties in each country say, especially about their own countries, this should not be taken as gospel. It should be weighed carefully while maintaining an independent and critical perspective. I agree that the government of Mali is Bonapartist, but it has also continued its repressive policies in the north, which are a consequence of its nationalism.\n\nMy main goal was to address ethnic violence, which many leftist circles seem unwilling to acknowledge but is a significant part of the current reality in the Sahel.\n\nEdit: If everyone ignores me, well, at least I said what I wanted to say. Maybe I didn\u2019t express it in the best way, but I said it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to simply overlook an injustice just because it\u2019s committed by \"progressives.\" Just as when we talk about Stalin, we can\u2019t ignore his mistakes and horrors\u2014such as the forced sedentarization of certain peoples like the Tuvans or the ethnic cleansing policies against the Korean ethnic groups in the East. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I stand by Stalin, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to ignore or deny some of his worst actions. Even more so, we cannot ignore these issues specially when they are committed by progressives forces. We must not fall into campism.\n\nEdit 2: I would be more interested in knowing what the people of the north think and what their desires are regarding their situation. What future do they want? There has already been much suffering in the north, caused by a succession of governments both from the colonial era and after independence. The genocidal actions of the 1960s, which culminated in the 1963 rebellion, cannot be ignored. I didn\u2019t mention it earlier to avoid going into too much detail, but now I bring it up to highlight that there is a thread and continuity between the old policies of Mali and the current ones towards the north. A continuation of state violence.\n\nEdit 3: Another thing to mention about the parties is that in countries with strong ethnic conflicts, political parties often have a biased view in favour of one ethnic group over another. Take the case of the JVP in Sri Lanka, where this party, which defines itself as \"Marxist-Leninist,\" held positions, to say the least, questionable during the civil war. It favoured a Sinhalese nationalism and displayed some discrimination towards the Tamils. The JVP took a stance in favour of the repression of the Tamil Eelam Tigers, a group fighting for their national liberation, whose ideological character was quite progressive in contrast to the island's government. The Tamil people's struggle stemmed from the oppression they lived under, and the JVP failed to see it. Meanwhile, other sectors of the Sinhalese left did recognise it. The LTTE was also labelled as \"terrorist\" by the way.",

                    "body": ">They probably shouldn't fight alongside jihadists then.\n\nClaiming that the Azawad rebels, who are extremely heterogeneous and have failed to unify, are all allied with jihadists is misleading. There is no uniform stance on jihadists among them, and what they usually have, rather than alliances, are non-aggression agreements. In fact, these ties between some rebel factions and jihadists have caused internal discontent. It is true that the MNLA at one point reached an agreement and collaborated with Ansar Dine, but it also had clashes with them.\n\nThe government of Mali decided to terminate the 2015 peace agreements, opening a new front and worsening the situation in the north. It is true that some rebels had suspended their participation as early as 2022, but this was in response to the Malian government's repression of ethnic minorities. The government's decision to officially end the agreements only made matters worse. This is not to mention the atrocities committed by the FAMA and Wagner forces against civilians. A clear example of this occurred on August 25 of this year, when the FAMA used a drone to attack a market, killing civilians, including children, in retaliation for the popular support the rebels have in the north under the excuse that \"terrorist\" where hiding there. An excuse that cannot be distinguished from those used by the Israeli regime to justify the killings of Palestinians. When this event caused an international scandal, the government said it would investigate, but in practice, no effort was made to bring the perpetrators to justice, and this true war crime remained unpunished.\n\nThings are not as simple as they seem. The narrative of \"they made deals with the jihadists, so they deserve everything that happens to them\" is childish and reductionist.\n\nMoreover, we must consider the various Tuareg uprisings and how they all ended, and what caused them and why they happen. The first Tuareg uprising occurred in what is now Niger in 1916 during French colonization. Subsequent Tuareg uprisings took place in northern Mali except for the one of 2007 who was in Mali and Niger. In the 1960s, these uprisings were a response to the genocidal practices of the Malian government, leading to the forced displacement of many people. This created waves of refugees who were forced to flee to countries like Algeria. In fact, the musical group Tinariwen is made up of Tuareg refugees in Algeria. Another uprising occurred in the 1990s, this time with external support from Gaddafi's Libya, as a response to the abuses of Malian authorities against these groups. It was one of the most significant uprisings. A smaller-scale uprising happened in 2007, followed by the current one that began in 2012. All these uprisings have resulted in atrocious suffering for the minorities in the north. Losing again could lead to increased ethnic oppression, which they are already enduring. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are seeking alliances wherever they can.\n\nA parallel can be drawn between the situation in northern Mali and the Malian state, and that of Sudan and South Sudan, except that here the alliances are much more complex, and the ethnic issues are as well.\n\nEdit: Moreover, the tactics of the Tuareg and Arab rebels, as there are also Arab independence movements, have not followed a terrorist tactic. Therefore, they cannot be reduced to the same category. Not to mention that ideologically, most separatist groups advocate for respect for the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity of the region, something that jihadists do not do. Additionally, most, though not all, of the rebel groups have \"secular\" tendencies.\n\nEdit 2: I put secular in quotations because it's more complex. But the point is that they are far from being jihadist.",
