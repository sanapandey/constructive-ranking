You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The recent political events have shown us very clearly that any \"vision\" will be adopted by the working class as \"a possibility\" even if it's deranged, racist, economically stupid, etc. People want something to save them from this fucking mess we're in. We also want to be saved from the mess we're in? I think a book like \"Inventing the Future\" by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams at least maps possibilities for taking platform capitalism (Neo-feudalism, whatever you wanna call it) and using these technological conditions as the basis for a transitional socialism (I'm sure there's better newer books on the subject, but this is just the one I've read most recently). I think we have to at least give people hints of what we're trying to get at in a long term sense otherwise we're just saying \"we got this, trust us.\"",

Marxism will help you understand how and why things are the way that they are, and by understanding that you can understand the necessary steps to progress. There is always an objective answer and truth and Marxism is the tool you use to reach that. If you study the principles of Marxism and understand them well then you will be able to determine what the transition to socialism would look like and what it will require in your current conditions, but there is no book written out there that is transhistorical and applies to every situation because things are constantly changing.",
