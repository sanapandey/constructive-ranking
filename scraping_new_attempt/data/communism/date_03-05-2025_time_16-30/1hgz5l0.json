You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "This document has been posted here before, but without any comments, and I think it\u2019s a very interesting piece. Specifically, this document makes a lot of claims about the class structure of Canada, and various assertions that I would really like to start a conversation about. \n\nSpecifically, the following section of the document;\n\nWe must differentiate the non-exploited strata of the working-class (the worker elite) from the exploited and super-exploited strata of the proletariat, as well as Indigenous semi-proletarians who still have some access to independent production (hunting, fishing, land rights). We must analyze the methods and means by which the worker elite is won over to support imperialist policies, wars, colonialism and generalized Canadian chauvinism, and why and how or if these methods equally apply to or exercise hegemony over the rest of the working class. What proportion of the working-class is covered by pension funds, and to what extent? What proportion of the working-class is invested in the inflated real estate markets in and around Canada\u2019s major urban centers? What are the demographics and geographical spread of the growing non-unionized proletariat, which is more exploited, has fewer benefits, and is living far more precariously? Just a few questions among many more that we will have to answer in trying to sketch out the stratification of the working-class in Canada. If we are to prioritize the organization of the proletariat, then Revolutionary Initiative and the Party form that will follow from it must be able to define it.\n\nThis notion of dividing the working class into three categories, the worker elite, the proletariat and the super exploited proletariat is very interesting, since the forces us to not think of the working class as a monolith, which is a common error made by communists in the imperial core. I guess that because the worker elite has been bought off by Canadian imperialism, so their interests are aligned with the Canadian state, this puts them in a position of seeing the bourgeois electoral system as a viable political vehicle for their interests. Could this explain why we have seen decades of revisionism across the imperial core, that because a large section of the working class is not proletarianised, that they then do not have any class interest in making revolution?\n\nIs this distinction between the working class and proletariat useful, or can it lead to errors that I\u2019m not able to foresee? Any other comments about this document would be massively appreciated too.",

                    "body": "despite kicking up a storm about how not differentiating the \"worker elite\" and the labor aristocracy is \"dangerous and politically juvenile\", they fail to make a good argument for this case. the way they define \"worker elite\" is the exact same way most people in this subreddit would define the labor aristocracy: non-exploited and benefitting from imperialist superprofits. it reads as a complete confusion where they agree with Lenin that the imperialists buy off a certain amount of the working class in the imperialist country and they agree that this applies to a large amount of workers in klanada but, for some reason, they insist that the word \"labor aristocracy\" cannot extend outside union leadership. in defining the labor aristocracy as a narrow group of petty-bourgeois pencil pushers, you have to wonder why even keep this term around anyway? the distinction between the worker elite and the labor aristocracy is supposedly necessary because of the contradiction between them. but even this org says they aren't worried about the worker elite as a class at the moment so why does this contradiction matter? they also say the so-called \"worker elite\" is vacillating but this leads me to my second problem with this article which is that they aren't really talking about these classes in terms of *nationality* despite recognizing that klanada is a prisonhouse of nations. they write off the petite bourgeoisie as not a vacillating class. if they were speaking of the oppressor nation petite-bourgeoisie, I would agree with this change. however, I would caution this change when it comes to oppressed nation petite-bourgeoisie because Maoists are often so eager to throw away any semblance of New Democratic tactics in favor of the \"multinational party\" dogma. neither this change nor the original mention nation in relation to the petite-bourgeoisie at all and the same question comes up with the worker elite. at one part, they contrapose the worker elite with \"younger workers, women, and industries occupied by people from oppressed nations and national minorities\" which would imply that there is no oppressed nation worker elite or it is a small minority. so what exactly makes this class \"vacillating\" within imperialist settler-colonialist terrain? \n\nI also disagree with this article in getting rid of the class category of lumpen. I guess it wasn't enough to get rid of one Marxist term with a flimsy justification. all the arguments are pretty bad and are only in conversation with strawmen. \"lumpen\" as a category is only moralistic if you make it so. was J. Sakai being moralistic when he wrote *The \"Dangerous Class\" and Revolutionary Theory*? is MIM(Prisons) moralistic for their [theorization of the lumpen](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/article/defining-and-measuring-the-lumpen-class-in-the-united-states-a-preliminary-analysis/)(use Tor for this link)? these works are trying to understand the lumpen as an important stratum for making revolution in imperialist countries, not with the intent of exclusion. this group uses the myth of the prison-industrial complex as one reason to justify the change. MIM(Prisons) has shown that prisons are overall unprofitable and the majority of prisoner labor is for internal maintenance to offset part of the costs. this hasn't stopped them from organizing prisoners. so the word \"lumpenproletariat\" wasn't stopping this group from organizing prisoners if they wanted to. like they say in the beginning, they haven't even officially *talked* about the lumpen until now so it's not like this is even correcting some previously erroneous line that proved incorrect in practice. they don't have a firm strategy on organizing this group yet so why are they pre-emptively ditching this term?",
