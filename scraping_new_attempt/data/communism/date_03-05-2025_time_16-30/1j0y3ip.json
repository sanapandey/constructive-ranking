You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "I wouldn't bother. The function of these kinds of books is one I find extremely helpful: they allow you to read more detailed books with an idea of the arc of the history some event may be a part of. For example, when I read any book over modern Chinese peasant history I almost always relate it back to William Hinton's works, as they are what have created my view of the arc of this history. It makes me feel less like I am memorizing facts for a test and more like I am learning about an actual society with real people.\u00a0\n\n\nThe problem is that any liberal is going to have a poor understanding of this arc; for example, was the the transition to the Khruschev period an end to an unnecessarily brutal and directionless form of socialism and to \"real socialism\" where everyone gets a car, a TV, and freedom of speech, or a revisionist turn that empowered the bourgeoisie? Was the collapse of the USSR the result of Gorbachev's mismanagement of problems that permeate all societies, or the result of the laws of motion of capitalism? It's very difficult to try to construct an understanding of the latter from a book that argues the former if you don't know anything about the topic in question.\u00a0",
