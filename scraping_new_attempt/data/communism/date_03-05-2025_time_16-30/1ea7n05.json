You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I doubt this means the resistance is accepting a two-state solution (no reason to at this point) but I wonder what this unity is supposed to accomplish if Fatah is not all in and what details are inaccurate.",

The push for a temporary \u201eunited government\u201c under the terms of the armed national liberation movement (i.e. to immediately stop the extermination by the settler colony, complete withdrawal of the settler butchers from Gaza etc.) [given the preparation by the settler colony, Amerika, and the UAE](https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/us---israel---uae-held-secret-meeting-on-gaza--day-after--pl) to occupy Gaza with an \u201einternational force\u201c and destroy the national liberation movements through using the PA as lackeys, could therefore might be a successful maneuver to thwart exactly that. \n\nI\u2018am also doubtful that they would immediately take up the position of capitulation (\u201etwo-state solution\u201c) under the present conditions. Nevertheless it\u2018s interesting to see that since a considerable time a fraction of Hamas appears to be playing with the idea to being content with the imperialist \u201etwo-state solution\u201c. Back in April there was an interview with the high official Khalil al-Hayya where he expressed the following: \n\n>Speaking to the AP in Istanbul, Al-Hayya said Hamas wants to join the Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by the rival Fatah faction, to form a unified government for Gaza and the West Bank. He said Hamas would accept \u201ca fully sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the return of Palestinian refugees in accordance with the international resolutions,\u201d along Israel\u2019s pre-1967 borders.\n\n>If that happens, he said, the group\u2019s military wing would dissolve.\n\n>\u201cAll the experiences of people who fought against occupiers, when they became independent and obtained their rights and their state, what have these forces done? They have turned into political parties and their defending fighting forces have turned into the national army,\u201d he said.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/hamas-khalil-alhayya-qatar-ceasefire-1967-borders-4912532b11a9cec29464eab234045438\n\nIt\u2019s of course not the first time where similar things in this direction were stated. But now with this allegedly commitment in the final declaration it\u2018s more concerning.",
