            "body": "It's a good attempt and I always appreciate interrogating specific examples. But the fundamental concept is flawed:\n\n>Very rarely is there simply a question of 'effective' and 'ineffective' tactics. One tactic might accomplish a short-term goal, while hampering the long-term political development of the workers. Another might help develop one worker's intermediate political consciousness while isolating them from the mass of backwards workers. For example, it was suggested to me at various points by outsiders that I should raise the worker's problems with local media, or with celebrities associated with the brand of liquor. It is possible that this strategy would have been 'effective' in improving our situation, but it would have been devastating for the political development of the workers as individuals and as a possible proletarian nucleus. What sort of lessons are we trying to impart here? That when proletarians have a grievance, the best response is to link ourselves with some 'friendly' section of the bourgeoisie and meekly solicit their leadership? As communist sympathizers, we want to win every struggle into which we intervene, of course. But this can never come at the expense of our long-term orientation towards the construction of a proletarian class party fit to wage and win a war against the bourgeoisie. \n\nYou can't trick workers into going further than the struggle they are participating in. The communist solution must come from the situation itself, it cannot be imposed from the outside. If the goal is an increase in wages, then workers who are looking for that will use any means at their disposal to achieve it. You really think no one else thought to go to the media and that, if we don't talk about it, it'll go away? If you push for an unrealistic increase in wages because you think it is better for agitational purposes, you will simply be isolated by reformists and union bureaucrats who will point to you as an agitator, utopian, etc. \n\nThe writer understands this in some capacity:\n\n>I have watched many people try to forcefully argue (often bourgeois or postmodern, to be fair) political points in a work environment, and it quite often ends with the alienation of the person who was supposed to be convinced, and the implicit or explicit labeling of the 'educator' as haughty or annoying. I wanted to avoid this, and simply be a regular worker who pushed in the right direction at the right time, but it is possible that I over-corrected and missed opportunities for further advancement of the struggle. \n\nThis is correct, using a simple wage dispute to advocate for the revolutionary takeover of society and its restructuring is not the correct path. But being a \"regular worker\" achieved exactly what was expected:\n\n>By resisting the temptation to alienate him at the very beginning, we left open the possibility of drawing him into our camp, and at the very least discouraged him from swinging towards the bourgeoisie. Had the struggle escalated to a higher level, having the site manager be sympathetic to our cause, or even simply wavering, could prove to be valuable. For those reasons, I chose to discard my initial line, and push in conjunction with the two other workers for a calm approach to the site manager. \n\n...\n\n>A good chunk of the workers viewed the outcome of this sequence as a stunning victory, but I am inclined to view it as a tactical victory with indecisive, or arguably even negative strategic implications.\n\nCommunist never entered the picture and on every strategic question, the reformist line was accepted. At least the writer is aware of this but, instead of political agitation alien to economistic struggle, they look for gimmicks. \n\n>My choice to push for a petition was initially undertheorized, but, in retrospect, I believe it was the correct decision. It bound us together as a group of signatories in a way that, for example, the airing of grievances by individuals at a meeting would not have. Furthermore, the actual text of the document allowed me (and you) to take a read on the political level of the group. It also initiated a process in which we, the workers, acted collectively, after which then management responded, and so on. Finally, it circumvented the normal, bourgeois methods of escalating workplace problems.\n\nA petition may or may not have been the correct tactic but let's not pretend it's some great strategic innovation. It's a pathetic shadow of forming a union which at least one other worker was already advocating for:\n\n>We also learned that a second worker had gone through significant labor unrest, including a sick-out strike, and a unionization process at a previous facility. This worker asked to speak with the Bottling team, and advised us to discuss next steps and know how far we were willing to advance the struggle.\n\nThere were even initial steps towards this\n\n>A discussion was held among the Bottling line as a group, where the prospect of a sick-out strike was raised and received significant vocal support. In subsequent individual discussions, I introduced the idea of slowdowns.\n\nInstead none of these happened, so it's pretty likely the petition was a mistake which will now cause radical workers to be isolated/fired and the rate of exploitation to increase, which the writer admits is the most likely result. To be clear, other than a few conversations, communism never came up and was not involved in any way in what was a simple dispute over wages that was resolved amicably:\n\n>Both before and after this sequence, I attempted to develop this point in individual conversations with my coworkers. These efforts were relatively well-received, and advanced us towards a more complete discussion of the appropriation of surplus-value by the bourgeoisie, and therefore the kernel of the whole capitalist-imperialist system. \n\nThis article is at best premature and at worst completely detached from the actual substance of what happened compared to its supposed theoretical importance. The thing about communists is that they can choose any situation to intervene and look for places where the demands of workers at least somewhat correspond to revolutionary solutions. Why are we wasting time in a place where supposedly unionization is beyond the consciousness of the workers? The simple answer is that is where this person was already working. But a party needs the discipline to send people where they are needed, not where they have friends or whatever.",
