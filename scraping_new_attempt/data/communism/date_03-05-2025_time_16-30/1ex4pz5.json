You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Instead you lambasted them for being white and daring to criticize foreign revisionism. For all the talk of chauvinism you utter thus is just Noble Savage orientalism on your part.\n\nYou should be ashamed that you are a Dengist and supportive of the counter revolitionaries who destroyed and murdered the Socialist progress in China. Dooming hundreds of millions to live under Comprador capitalism.\n\nTheory of productive forces is like the addict friend who promises they are just 1 week away then they are sober.\n\nThey are always one \"5 year NEP plan away and then real socialism comes\" decades and decades over. There is not some mythical light at the end of the tunnel they will wake up and not be revisionist.\n\n>Also, sorry honey but you can't apply theory verbatim,\n\nThis is not about applying theory verbatim, which in your case is just not applying any theory and choosing to uphold \"aes\". the Chinese understood very well the dire situation they were in advancing a Semi Feudal Peasant majority nation forward. They had a relatively small Proletariat, and STILL chose to proceed they path they did under worse conditions than Russia. Absolutely cowardly of you",

I noticed a comment from someone under one of their posts on Instagram arguing that Venezuela is a settler colony similar to i$rael and therefore shouldn't exist.

In great detail. Im thrilled to see how you conclude this\n\n\nYou have really shown you have nothing to say. This is just liberal virtue signalling but apparently its supposed to impress us.\n\nI hold the Chinese Revolution to the highest standard because it is the farthest our entire species has gone towards the path of Communism. It is the most politically and theoretically advanced our species has ever been organized. That revolution was overthrown violently, and in its place an new bourgeoisie took over and allowed western capital to plunder its resources and people. Ending the advances of the Cultural Revolution and violently destroying all of the advances of the socialist period.\n\nYou do not support the former but the latter. A revisionist and openly capotalist clique of all of Chinas industrialists, capitalists comprador bourgeoisie and literal billionaires. Nobody here supports the oppression of the Global South and chinese social imperialism more than you. You should be absolutely ashamed.\n\nThese are not my opionions im advancing. Since you are so stuck on the concept of me being white that it clouds you with hatred. These are the opinions of the actual Revolutionary Communists parties in India the Phillipines and Turkey. If anything i have been way to kind to the Chinese bourgeoisie so far. I would love to see you accuse them of chauvinism for criticizing Chinese Social Imperialism that empowers and funds indian and Filipino fascism and counter revolution.\n\nIf you have something more to say that isnt just \"i cant be wrong, you are white\" then please do. Because this is just generic liberalism, i expected better from a self professed communist. \n\nHopefully this conversation doesnt degenerate into looking into eachothers post history to find something to insult, im sure i could find a load of material to dig up on you. \n\nHave some humility and consider reading theory from the Global South you claim to care about",

I am currently reading through Suniti Ghosh's the himalayan adventure (available on marxist.org) and from the general scheme of things it seems that india from even before it inception has been the us' and the erstwhile social imperialist ussr's lapdog trying to confront china along the Himalayan region (which of course ended badly for it during the so-called indo-chinese \"war\" of 1962 where chinese troops reached Asom in response to indian agression in just one day, and could've arrived in delhi in less than a week if they wanted). \n\nI am especially interested in this as the Indian big bourgeoisie have nothing to gain from the Himalayan regions which it claims as its own (there are no natural resources of interest in ladakh, aksai chin and arunachal pradesh) and the nehrus on several occasions claimed that the war was totally ideological. The us and other imperialists want india to be their local base from where they can gain more hold over the rest of south asia - especially sri lanka, bangladesh, nepal and such. \n\nEven now, it feels like the indian big bourgeoisie favours the us more as the economic survey (govt report) of this year recommended that india should be more open to chinese FDI but it was summarily rejected, at least on the face of it. \n\nAnd regarding the weapons supply, it seems the us + israel have been the main suppliers, especially for counter-insurgency measures and the defence sector in general:\n\nhttps://rupe-india.org/old-site/61/rising.html\n\nYou could tell obviously that i haven't read the maoists on the issue which i should. So, i was wondering if they have analysed this facet in their work.\n\nTagging u/CoconutCrab115 as reddit's notifications sometimes do not work.",

India does not reveal anything publicly about its defence sector. This year the govt did not even reveal the staff shortage numbers which was not an issue previously:\n\n[https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/citing-national-security-defence-ministry-declines-to-share-details-of-staff-shortage-in-armed-forces/article68493621.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/citing-national-security-defence-ministry-declines-to-share-details-of-staff-shortage-in-armed-forces/article68493621.ece)\n\nBut from other reports, again, it seems that China does not supply arms to India (at least on a scale that is impactful):\n\n>India accounted for 31 percent of Russia\u2019s exports, 30 percent of France\u2019s, 13 percent of South Korea\u2019s, 37 percent of Israel\u2019s, and 15 percent of South Africa\u2019s. During 2019-23, India was receiving arms from seven major exporters: France (with India at 29 percent of France\u2019s total exports), Russia (34 percent), Israel (37 percent), South Korea (15 percent), Ukraine (11 percent), South Africa (13 percent), and Poland (0.6 percent). India\u2019s 4.7 percent surge in arms import saw the entries of Ukraine and Poland as emerging options.\n\n[https://thediplomat.com/2024/05/indias-puzzled-military-industrial-complex/](https://thediplomat.com/2024/05/indias-puzzled-military-industrial-complex/)\n\n>China as a social imperialist power is devastating the lives of indians\n\nHow so? Like how does this convert into concrete reality? The policy decisions are driven by us and other western imperialists - right from agriculture to counter-insurgency. Also, it would seem that India, while dependent on China's goods (the figure is somewhere around 108 billion USD per year iirc), it only allows a little FDI from the country. Although, again, Chinese FDI seldom comes through non-shell-companies route:\n\n>But in 2015 the Louvre Group itself was acquired by the Shanghai-based Jin Jiang International Holdings, a State-owned tourism enterprise of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Or in other words, in the name of privatisation, a guest facility of a public Institute in India is being run by the Chinese State\n\n[https://rupeindia.wordpress.com/2018/06/18/what-does-privatisation-really-do-a-case-from-a-publicly-funded-academic-institution/](https://rupeindia.wordpress.com/2018/06/18/what-does-privatisation-really-do-a-case-from-a-publicly-funded-academic-institution/)\n\n>I do need to study more about the supposed cooperation China and India have in BRICS+ together though\n\nRight, but again it would seem India does not have as much bite in the BRICS as China does. The PM even skipped the BRICS meeting:\n\n[https://theprint.in/diplomacy/modi-skips-brics-plus-meet-on-israel-hamas-jaishankar-attends-says-no-compromise-on-terrorism/1853697/](https://theprint.in/diplomacy/modi-skips-brics-plus-meet-on-israel-hamas-jaishankar-attends-says-no-compromise-on-terrorism/1853697/)\n\nOne of the most interesting aspect of the Indian big bourgeoisie is its capability to latch on to any form of imperialism it can find to survive. Again, the mention of Chinese FDI in the economic survey is just a start but who knows. Saying anything else would amount to speculation especially given India's enthusiasm over going to war with China on behalf of the western imperialists.\n\n>This is the only link i can give, and it only briefly talks about China in 1 sentence.\n\nI am aware of the interview. I was referring more to the maoist document on bannedthought. I leafed through it. It does not specifically talk of Chinese social imperialism in India but it does mention the BRICS which you find interesting:\n\n>China wishes to dominate the New Development Bank in the manner in which the US dominates IMF and WB. According to the initial plan BRICS countries must arrange equal share of money reserve of ten billion dollars for this bank. But China wishes to contribute large amount of money right in the beginning. Anyway, only China can arrange the heavy additional capital the bank inevitably needs later.\n\n[https://bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Books/China-Social-Imperialism-CPI-Maoist-2021-Eng-view.pdf](https://bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Books/China-Social-Imperialism-CPI-Maoist-2021-Eng-view.pdf)\n\nNeedless to say, India's interest in the BRICS does not seem to be its own interests only. But that needs further study.",
