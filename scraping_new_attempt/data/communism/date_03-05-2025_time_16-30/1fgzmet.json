Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

            "body": "I've been thinking a lot lately about how modern imperial core mass media reflects the anxieties and contradictions inherent in petty-bourgeois existence. This manifests itself especially clearly in \"pop\" music, the lyrics of which are predominantly about love, sexual desire, relationships, breakups, etc. This is something that definitely deserves investigation, especially since this has been a core feature of imperial core \"pop\" music since its very beginnings. It seems to be a result of the alienation caused by petty-bourgeois existence, in which nearly all social relations are tinged with and morphed by commodification. There is simply no space, within a class ideology deriving from a material base of parasitism, for any genuinely collective consciousness to develop. For the petty-bourgeois subject there is no society, leaving in its wake just an endless torrent of commodities to consume; as a result, petty-bourgeois social consciousness can only be constructed along the basis of desire for commodified objects standing in for society, and the art that they consume (and produce) reflects this. Petty-bourgeois art is fundamentally a celebration of the petty-bourgeois subject's endless chase for an end to their alienation through commodity consumption; at the same time, though, the realization of the object of desire in such art as an *actual* commodity ([an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LfJnj66HVQ)) reveals far too clearly the actual scale of petty-bourgeois alienation from anything resembling humanity. Thus, bourgeois art requires a subject that is both an object of individual desire and consumption, like a commodity,  *and yet* can also be conceived of as existing above and beyond social reality, away from the \"materialistic\" world of commodity consumption. The subject of much imperial core art, and at least 80% of imperial core \"pop\" music, is therefore the idealized person with the contradictory aspects of  both being commodified and yet being beyond commodification, in the idealized role of the lover, a person whose unconditional bond to the petty-bourgeois subject is imagined to be able to fill the gaping absence of purpose in their consciousness produced by capitalist alienation and (to quote a Justin Bieber song) \"make \\[their\\] life complete\". Of course, these songs are themselves commodities, and thus the petty-bourgeois attempt to escape alienation only reinforces it. I suspect that the above phenomenon also manifests itself in actual imperial core romantic/sexual relationships as well.\n\nThese are just my initial thoughts on the subject. I invite ruthless criticism of them: I fear that my analysis is overly mechanical, and that there is liberalism lurking within it. Also, if you have any books or articles about this or similar topics, I would be grateful.",

Second, the usual claim is that they're funded by RT (as you see per the comment OP), which their somewhat related predecessor Redfish definitely was, but which the newer Red claims was never true for itself. And I remember specifically that Redfish (i.e. the predecessor) made an anti-invasion post when it happened and covered anti-war protests in Russia favorably. Which I would say might actually be a rightist error since I'm not convinced there was anything progressive in those protests. But I don't think it's possible for any honest person to say they are overly biased towards the RF and Russian imperialism when they favorably covered protests that were likely largely made up of people from the western-funded NGO complex, Navalny's \"movement\", and other liberals. As for the CPRF: first time I'm hearing that claim. I personally think their political line is far too different from that of the CPRF on fundamental issues for that to make sense. They aren't of the \"WAP\" tendency when it comes to the question of imperialism which the \"C\"PRF is a prime global stronghold of, they seem to lean more towards Maoist analyses of the conflict as inter-imperialist as the person you're replying to probably was referring to. For example they published a piece interviewing the CPI (Maoist) where China is criticized as an imperialist country https://thered.stream/on-the-frontlines-of-revolution-an-exclusive-interview-with-the-communist-party-of-india-maoist/.\n\n\nOf course I don't want to be overly enthusiastic in defending them; I would rather err on the side of caution in that regard as with any leftist publication and \"content creator\" (since they also do work with and in essence promote actual individual \"content creators\" who have their own brands, like Lady Izdihar). But as I said I really think they've shown themselves to be fairly principled, serious and dare I say radical as journalists and a news outlet, at least moreso than any nonsense made by Second Thought, Hakim, or the like. If anyone thinks I am overestimating them or making any other mistake then feel free to criticize me.",

Hopefully this comment is enough to spark any necessary discussion.\n\nThe RMS published some truly awful \u201cthink\u201dpiece the other day that seems to only lay bare how bankrupt the Amerikan \u201cMaoist\u201d movement is.\n\nhttps://the-masses.org/2024/09/25/against-sloganeering-revisionism-and-gonzaloism-with-a-note-from-the-editorial-board-of-the-masses/\n\n>OBRSG confuses our concerns about the operation\u2019s strategic implications and outcome for questioning whether or not Palestinians are justified in using force to resist. This is a ridiculous conflation. This simplistic analysis of the Al-Aqsa flood amounts to sloganeering without advancing any discussion, reducing the debate down to a black-and-white \u2018Is it justified?\u2019. Of course Palestinians are justified in using force to resist! But do we think the Al-Aqsa flood has served the world proletarian revolution? The Al-Aqsa flood was not a proletarian uprising \u2013 it was an attack by HAMAS, a group OBRSG itself calls opportunist6, and is not a party of nor led by the proletariat. Events preceding October 7th and the situation in Gaza today materially show the Al-Aqsa flood has not served the proletariat. Due to the lack of strong organization amongst the proletariat and other oppressed classes in Palestine and the superior strength of Israel, largely due to US backing, the Al-Aqsa flood sparked a wave of unspeakable terror from Israel against the Palestinian people. HAMAS and the armed resistance have been unable to stop this genocidal attack on the people, with well over 100,000 Palestinians killed.7 \n\nTypical genocidal denial of Palestinian self-determination and the victories within Gaza in favor of viewing Palestinians as a statistic to cry over. If Hamas is opportunist for engaging in armed revolution against the fascist regime that occupies its land, then what does that make the RMC who waxes poetic on its military situation from the comfort of their seat in the engine of repression?\n\nBut what purpose does this serve? Well the RMC is quick to clarify.\n\n>The tasks required of communists today are much more extensive than simply differentiating between good or bad violence. Regardless of how \u2018revolutionary\u2019 OBRSG portrays their unconditional sloganeering for people\u2019s war to be, this mere differentiation between violence and the recognition of the right to resistance does not even break with bourgeois right.9 Obviously, the violence of the ruling classes and violence of the toiling masses differ by the purpose they serve, but the struggle of the working class cannot be reduced to this violence. It is essential for communists to move way beyond the mere recognition of resistance, towards strategizing and evaluating our tactics, and to understand that the way forward for Palestine is much more complicated than calling for deceptively simple \u2018people\u2019s war!\u2019 \n\nHow childish to demand the revolutionary overthrow of all that exists. It might be confusing why such an organization even calls itself Maoist but I think the angle of cooption becomes clear in the following passage.\n\n>We call for one secular-democratic state across all of historic Palestine because this demand deals with both aspects of the problem: *the need to overthrow the Israeli state, and the fact that there are people living in Israel who are not the enemy and who shouldn\u2019t be expelled from historic Palestine.*\n\nMost Amerikans describe Israel in more stark terms than they do their own settler state so it\u2019s rare to see someone so brazenly use Israel to euphemistically describe Euro-Amerika. I\u2019ve unfortunately had run-ins with the RMS and felt they were pretty chauvinist so I\u2019m glad their white supremacism has come to the forefront, even if it means another \u201crevolutionary\u201d \u201ccommunist\u201d org collapses under its own ineptitude. Better fewer, but better.\n\nEdit: RMS*, not RMC.",

            "body": "The Indian state in the guidance of imperial capital has made another major step towards antagonizing the peasantry and the working class in India - this could have irreversible impacts on a mass scale:\n\nhttps://countercurrents.org/2024/09/waltzing-with-bayer-makes-icar-blind-ditches-mandate-to-farmers-and-uses-mutagenesis-to-drive-herbicide-tolerant-crops-into-india/\n\nThe rice-wheat system (itself a nutrient lacking diet popularised by the imperial green revolution in the 60s) is prevalent throughout the nation which puts the majority of population at risk. And this seems to be by design or at least partly by design (quoting from the article):\n\n>Dr Casey Means says:\n\n>\u201cThe largest merger ever done in Germany was Bayer Monsanto, where Bayer, which is a pharmaceutical company merged with Monsanto, which is an agrochemical company in the United States. If you look at what Bayer makes, they make cancer drugs for things like non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. If you look at what Monsanto makes, which is Roundup, which is the most widely used pesticide in America, the cancer that it causes is non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. (There are over 100,000 court cases winding their way through US courts \u2014 added by A R). They paid out USD 11 billion in the past couple years for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma cases. So, the companies are merging that are directly known to cause the disease, with a medical company that has a treatment for the disease. This is very dark.\u201d \n\nhttps://x.com/newstart_2024/status/1828064283604791425\n\nWhat is the historical role of Monsanto-Bayer in India? Monsanto-Bayer introduced bt cotton (a gm crop - the only one allowed till now) to India which immediately upon introduction overtook the market, made it difficult for small and marginal farmers (who constitute 47% of India's workforce - this could be a larger figure given the sketchy methodology of data collection and shadow employment by women which is not counted as employment in the field - and of which 86% are small and marginal, that is, they own 0-2 ha of farmland) to obtain seeds because the average income of farmers in the country (again seems a bit inflated as big farmers are also accounted for in the list) is around \u20b910,000 a month and according to RUPE's calculation the expenditure stands at \u20b914,000 around. The farmers cannot sustain themselves. Bt cotton seeds constitute almost 95% of the cotton in india now. There are also concerns of black market seeds the quality of which will be inferior. Having contributed to farmer suicides, bt cotton is now encountering the problem of pink bullworm, another variant of bullworm because of which bt cotton was supposedly introduced in the first place:\n\nhttps://www.downtoearth.org.in/agriculture/cotton-curse-how-pink-bollworm-evolved-to-be-the-biggest-threat-for-bt-cotton-92458\n\nWhat is the cost of these ht rice seeds?\n\n>Explaining benefits of the technology, Shirish Barwale, Managing Director of Mahyco said that field studies show that the cost of seven kilograms of the hybrid rice seeds through this technology plus the herbicide \u2018imazethapyr\u2019 will be around Rs 5150 per acre, while six kilograms of any other rice seed along with a complex mix of herbicides will cost anywhere around Rs 4000 per acre.\n\n>But, this extra cost in using the old conventional seeds does not include tractor rentals, cost of puddling and labor for transplanting of rice which varies between Rs 6500-7000 per acres depending upon the area in which the rice is being grown,\u201d Barwale said.\n\nhttps://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/seeds-major-mahyco-enters-into-jv-with-us-based-ricetec-for-ht-rice-wheat-124073101330_1.html\n\nThis is well above what small and marginal farmers can afford. Add to the fact, this will require huge amounts of water. But the majority of the country's farmers are dependent on monsoons and do not have access to irrigation. \n\nWhat is really insidious here is that the article markets ht rice as a non-gmo crop, whereas mutagenesis does modify the genetic makeup of the crop which makes it a gmo.\n\n(1/2)",

No. (Quoting again from the main article):\n\n>An HT crop is an HT crop whether produced by GE techniques or GMOs using chemical mutagenesis techniques. The Supreme Court-appointed TEC (Technical Expert Committee), in 2012-13, recommended a double bar on HT crops: (a) for being an HT crop per se because of their empirically proven, serious egregious impacts, (evidence after more than 40 years of growing these crops in the US/Argentina/Brazil) and (b) if in a centre of diversity or origin.\n\nWho are the players? \n\n>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations\u201d\n\nThe most interesting aspect is that the bill and melinda gates foundation already has its hands in practically every nerve of the indian suppy chain network, and haven't been afraid of getting their hands dirty:\n\n>It was in India, however, that the implications of BMGF\u2019s collaboration with Big Pharma first rose to widespread public attention.  In 2010 seven adolescent tribal girls in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh died after receiving injections of HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccines as part of a large-scale \u201cdemonstrational study\u201d funded by the Gates Foundation and administered by PATH.\n\nhttps://rupe-india.org/old-site/57/foundation.html\n\nWhat are the health concerns? \n\n>Combined with antibiotic use in medicine, veterinary medicine, and crop protection, co-exposures to herbicide (and agrochemicals in general) and antibiotics are common. Co-exposures alter the response of bacteria, notably those that can cause diseases in people, companion animals, or livestock, to antibiotics. In time, the co-exposure increases resistance to antibiotics.\n\nIndia is home to a huge population of extremely resistant antibiotic patients. This is due to the mismanagement or rather the strangling of the health sector, which has made India a safe haven for tuberculosis. The shortage of tb medicine leads to irregular doses leading back to continual development of antibiotic resistant TB:\n\n>Doctors were left with the impossible task of rationing drugs among patients, who were, in turn, skipping doses to make their precious allotments last longer. When patients miss doses, it boosts antibiotic resistance in the community, turning a treatable disease into a nastier, drug-resistant version. India has the world\u2019s highest burden of people with drug-resistant tuberculosis: nearly a hundred and twenty thousand, as of 2021. \n\nhttps://caravanmagazine.in/health/modi-government-failure-tuberculosis\n\nPdf available here:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/temp8279330240435878921\n\nThe article has also noted how imperial capital through the ICAR has already penetrated the education sector. This will be further exaggerated with the opening up of foreign universities campuses under the new education policy.\n\n(2/2)",

There is only one fundamental contradiction in any single entity or process that permeates it from beginning to end. As soon as the fundamental contradiction ceases, so does the entity.\n\n>There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions.\n\n>Hence, if in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction.\n\n- Also from On Contradiction\n\nThe principal contradiction is the most important contradiction at a given stage of a process. The principal contradiction is that which must be solved in order to continue progress in the development and of an entity towards its resolution, and is subject to change in the process of a thing.\n\nThe principal contradiction in the world today is that between the oppressed and oppressor nations. The fundamental contradiction of capitalism, as analyzed by Marx, is between the social character of production and the private appropriation of that which is produced. The fundamental contradiction stays the same throughout the existence of capitalism, whereas the principal contradiction has changed throughout capitalist development.",

The cult dictated how members dressed, where we lived, and who we dated. It punished us with sleep deprivation, humiliation, \u201cstruggle sessions,\u201d and beatings.

This is not something i'd found before, this is Very Gross behavior for 'Maoists.' i knew they fought on occasions Against the P$L and D$A Rapists but they themselves developed them in their ranks and did not correct. There's most certainly a tie with Petty Bourgeois Settler influence to cause this as that's the Ruling ideology and majority Class in the US.\n\n\ni mainly found them/have been interested in their \"Sunbelt thesis\" though i think it needs a re-evaluation given this and me Reading Settlers.",

(Even the Filipino Maoists, who have been at the forefront of championing a non-reformist answer to the \"LGBT question\", require among their people's army (not among the mass orgs or communist party proper) six months of abstinent \"courtship\", permission from the head of their detachment, and the prospective partner to pledge unity to the CPP before they allow soldiers to be married to or sexually active with someone, gay or straight).\n\nUltimately, like I said, take the site with a grain of salt; a lot of the stuff they're saying about the abuses is true and has been corroborated; a lot of the stuff is overexaggeration of stuff that's actually fine (for example, having very high standards for the amount of work people need to put in at the expense of sleep or bourgeois \"personal lives\") if not overdone; some of the stuff on there might be lies from wreckers, I couldn't say. Obviously rape, persecution of trans members, and beatings as a punishment for revisionism shouldn't be tolerated; still, the fact that the people behind MCE seem to have abandoned communism (and complain about things like mandatory daily study groups) does not inspire the greatest confidence in the way they present the story of the \"cult\".\n\n(I giggled at your use of dollar signs both in the MIM lingo way and as censorship. Certainly let's call out the bourgeois, money-grubbing mentality behind shit.)",

I decided to go to this person's post history and I found several posts of him asking for females to do incest role play with him over the internet, as well as several other posts describing his masturbation process that I refuse to utter. These people are comically depraved. I do wonder what they genuinely think they are achieving when they post in these subreddits trying to \"debunk\" Communism; perhaps they think that they will win over one or two people to Liberalism. The posts are always comically terrible nonetheless, you can tell that the points they are trying to \"debunk\" are usual first/second world petty bourgeois Reddit \"socialist\" talking points as opposed to points of real substance. One example of this is how their \"debunking\" post featured as a central point the topic of whether or not the USSR was wholly responsible for the victory of the Allies in WW2. How is that relevant?",
