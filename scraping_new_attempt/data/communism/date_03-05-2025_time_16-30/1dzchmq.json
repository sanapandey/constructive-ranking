Something like *The People\u2019s History of the United States* (I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s 100% objective and unbiased, but you get what I mean). Let me know if you have any recommendations!\n\nThank you to the previous post for the reminder! :D",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've never actually read Zinn, and his work may have some merits, but it's not proletarian in character; I'd recommend J Sakai's *Settlers* instead for the history of the Amerikan settler-colony.\n\nIn terms of other topics, I'm currently ploughing through Perry Anderson's *Lineages of the Absolutist State*; while (unfortunately) not really covering the rise of capitalism, it does a very good job of documenting the transformations of European feudalism in the critical centuries of the continent's rise to global hegemony.\n\nWhile not strictly history (for the most part), I would also recommend *Divided World Divided Class* as a rundown on the actual nature of modern global political economy, and especially the imperial core labor aristocratic class.",

Marx, Engels, and Lenin did, others of their Time did so why shouldn't we?\n\n\nThough of course never take Bourgeois science at face value:\n\n\n> Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke the utmost hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of \u201cpernicious sect\u201d. And no other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no \u201cimpartial\u201d social science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another, all official and liberal science defends wage-slavery, whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly na\u00efve as to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether workers\u2019 wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of capital.\n- Lenin, 3 sources and 3 components of Marxism\u00a0\n\n\n> Science has become subject to the dictates of the capitalist monopolies in their scramble for Profits and drive to war.\n- Cornforth, Dialectical Materialism and Science",

This is doubly true for those covering events prior to capitalist modernity. Even with this in mind, though, I don't see why one would want to read bourgeois history when there are good communist alternatives available; obviously you can always read between the idealist lines, but this ought to be a matter of necessity and not choice.",
