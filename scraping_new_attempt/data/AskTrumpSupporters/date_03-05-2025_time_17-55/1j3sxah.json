I work in \"criminal justice\" and his Trial was fair.  I also am fortunate enough to be engaged to a Physician who works with/administers fentanyl every day.  He literally could not have died from a fentanyl overdose because:\n\nHis respiratory rate was 22 breaths per min up to the moment he died ( He died of Lack of Oxygen as a result of shallow breaths, not a reduced breathing rate) \n\nA fentanyl overdose would see his resp rate cut by 40%.\n\nYou'd have to believe that George Floyd just happen to die at the exact same moment....just by chance.\n\nI have no love for George Floyd, but he died because Chauvin killed him.",

They (rightfully so) refused to comment on possible pre-existing medical conditions.    He died of a stroke.  So yes, until medical evidence is presented to the contrary, it was a coincidence.",

Does it matter that the same medical examiner later clarified that, \"all that transpired played a role in his condition\"?\n\nSo you believe that the Capitol Police were *wrong* for classifying his death as \"due to the attack\"?\n\nIf I cut your leg open and you bleed out, are you okay with the medical examiner classifying your death as \"natural causes\" because of \"low blood pressure\"?",

And fentanyl use with concomitant methamphetamine use along with extreme agitation from the arrest can explain a heightened respiratory rate with shallow depth. The question of reasonable doubt is more than answered here. The restraint technique was in the mpd handbook and was widely used at the time. The best argument for conviction seems to be that chauvin applied a routine restraint for too long And it became negligent at some point and it absolutely caused his death. This is quite the leap of faith given floyds condition that day.\n\nConflicting medical examiner reports both reached reasonable conclusions but even the states better report wasn\u2019t particularly clear as to the actual manner of death as it followed the cause of death.",

My fianc\u00e9e is also a physician. Not a pulmonologist, but someone who works with Fentanyl on a daily basis.  My view is nuanced and is a combination of my own observation and her take on the whole thing.\n\nHer view is that is was in no way a Fentanyl overdose, a meth overdose, an enlarged heart, the result of being placed too close to the exhaust of the car:  She believes the knee on the neck as well as the way the rest of his body was restrained was (and I will try to paraphrase as close to her original explanation) \"what killed the man who had a perfect storm of issues that were aggravated by the knee on the neck\"\n\nSince you have taken pleasure in saying my profession explains my lack of wits,   I will dumb it down.\n\nI believe it is the equivalent of a driver ignoring a red light and T-boning a car that had airbags and side impact absorption bars removed and killing them instantly upon impact and the debate that would ensue as to the family surviving had the equipment not being removed.\n\nI personally believe there is a possibility that he could have died had he been restrained less aggressively.  However, what I personally believe and what my better half personally believes doesn't matter.  The defense had the ability to raise all these issues. They had a very well-known pathologist.\n\n  \nSorry for spelling and grammar. Out and trying to respond.",

As a physician, i think it\u2019s easy to mix up a belief in the probably with a definitive assertion but i don\u2019t care to parse it all again. \n\nYour assumption that i was denigrating your intelligence is incorrect. My implication there was that it\u2019s easy to see why you take the side of the black criminal over law enforcement. There\u2019s a certain type of person who tends towards plaintiff side law and criminal defense. Career Public defense is probably the niche i would associate most with this type. \n\n. The defense made a very good case to show reasonable doubt re the states medical witnesses and raised basically all the points i did today and quite a few more. \n\n My then-gf and i took a strong interest in the trial and she was able to watch almost all of it and i watched a good deal. Her opinion was that the defense did more than enough but she assumed a guilty verdict due to the context of the trial. I agreed and we were correct. You can defer to the jury of lay people but i trust my own knowledge and that of my wife when confronted with the same set of facts that they were dealing with.\n\nAnd of course I\u2019ve been reasonable and thoughtful throughout as i corrected you",

For example [this chart](https://tee.fm/wp-content/gallery/other-charts/WelfareSingleMothers.jpg) showing the correlation of welfare and single mothers.\n\nAs soon as gov welfare took over from localized charity, a large number of societal problems were fostered.  There's a direct relationship between the amount of welfare received in a community and the decay of that community.  Take a look at the Indian reservations (the greatest recipients of welfare) for what that looks like.  Chronic alcoholism, drug use and violence.  Hell holes.\n\nI'm not saying people should be left to die in the streets of starvation and exposure.  But gov welfare creates more problems than it solves.",

It\u2019s about schools, hospitals, infrastructure, etc. Anything that improve the general populace quality of life.

If the Federal sentence sticks, he would likely be released in 2038.\n\nSo, in other words, if Trump were to do this, he would, effectively, reduce a sentence by all of three years, while simultaneously agitating a lot of people.

I can vouch that as a liberal I think all the time about Daniel Shaver's murder - that is one of the most fucked up things I've ever seen in my entire life, and I feel deep outrage about it. It makes me sick to my stomach that that officer is walking around freely. I feel outrage when anyone's rights are violated by the police. I'm currently following the case of the innocent white man being killed in kentucky when the wrong house was raided.\n\nDo you think that there is too much or too little prosecution of police for excessive force? Do you think that because some black (and white) cops aside from Chauvin got away with worse things, it invalidates this particular prosecution? (I recognize you are actually not in favor of a pardon, so credit to you there - I'm addressing the false equivalency that because there wasn't enough outrage about other instances, it partially discredits this one). Having watched a fuckton of police videos (from both sides, cops doing bad things and having things done to them), I will also argue that the Floyd video is pretty fucking egregious. Not as bad as Daniel Shaver, but it's up there.",

It's an unfortunate reality, I wish it weren't that way, but it's true and it's *to be expected*. Violent criminals exist, they have guns, cops try to arrest them and get hurt. The media covers it, usually locally, but it doesn't make a huge splash because \"it is what it is.\" People say \"aww, that sucks, fucking criminals\" and it doesn't get a ton of clicks on the national level because it's sad, but not sensational. I'm not saying that's right - but we live in a for-profit, capitalist media environment, and sensationalism is what sells.\n\nI would also argue that entirely obviously justified police killings of criminals don't cause a lot of media coverage either! Those happen all the time, I watch videos of them all the time on youtube, and they barely make the national news, or don't make it at all. What is your opinion of that? Do you think \\*justified\\* police killings are under-covered?\n\nThe scenario that reliably causes a big stir are times when cops vastly overstep their boundaries, violate someone's rights, and kill them on video - why? because there is a power imbalance, it's not \"expected,\" and it's sensational. But I would argue that police killings are not covered *enough* \\- what do you think about that? Police killed an innocent man in Kentucky and there is almost no national coverage of that - I think there should be way more! There is a ton of violence committed against american citizens that is not adequately covered.",

Because I would argue that every single killing of a cop, justified shooting of a person by a cop, or potentially unjustified killing of a person by a cop are *all* covered by local news. And at least the first two scenarios happen often *somewhere* in the US - a cop is killed every 3 days, and 3-4 people are shot every day by cops. The local news coverage is usually actually very matter of fact, and not too sensationalized. Do you think the national media should cover every single one of those? If you ran the national media, how would you decide which of those rose to the level of covering them? If you ran Fox for example, how would you pick which officer involved shootings to cover? Would you have reporters tackle each and every one to try and build a \"story,\" or would you just re-air segments from local media or repeat info from police department press releases?\n\nI agree that the national media picks and chooses stories to cover based on how much they rise above the \"noise\" - that is, are sensational and yes, have some kind of narrative. I personally do not watch any of the main national media, I consume zero Fox, CNN, NBC, whatever else and if your entire point is just that they are biased, then I'll grant you that. They obviously are, and I'm going to guess that \"left leaning\" media is more likely to report on potentially unjustified police killings. I agree with that, but as I said I think that's actually *a good thing. They should do it more.* But when the \"expected\" happens - that is, a cop gets killed in the line of duty or a violent criminal shoots at police and gets killed in return, what would *your* criteria be for the national media picking up that story? Would you cover every one of them and have your whole evening news just be listing off police stories from around the country?\n\nFor the record, my sources of media on this are all youtube channels - Law & Crime network, the Civil Rights Lawyer, Midwest Safety, etc. When a video piques my interest, I google the local news reporting on them and read more.",

The state was able to produce 5 medical experts... including a world renowned Pulmonologist and Toxicologist taht testified his level of meth was not medically significant in term of potential of death.  Dr Daniel Isenschmid testified that out of 150 cases of toxicological reports he's done where a dead person had similar amounts of meth in their system, of the same age, height and weight as George Floyd AND taking into account his enlarged account, 0 of those dead people died form the meth.    \n\nHe was convicted because the defense could not produce a single medical expert that would perjure themselves by saying \" I believe Mr Floyd died of an overdose\"     Not a single defense expert stated that.   They offered alternative theories ( which is what the defense is supposed to do, so good for them) but they were all rubbish.    For example, the theory of \"  Carbon Monoxide could have been as high as 11% in his blood\"    was  rebutted during Dr Tobin's second testimony to the jury/  \" his arterial blood gas was measured and his level were between 3-4% , which is normal. Everyone in the room here has those levels\" \n\nAll the defense had to do was produce a single medical expert that could say \" He died of XYZ\"\n\nThe lead prosecutor closed his cross-examination of the defense witness Dr Fowler with two amazing questions.\n\n\" Did Mr floyd just happen to die at the same time as the knee being placed on the neck?\"\n\n\" Did Mr Chauvin play any role at all in the death of Mr. Floyd\"\n\nI am a Trump supporter. I personally hate George Floyd and everything he stood for and don't care that he died.  But he did not die from anything other than his police encounter that day.\n\nAll these old death certificates that are being floated around are nothing more than old info being presented as something new.   The cause of death was/is still certified as \n\n\"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual and restraint and neck compressions\"",

I think it's crystal clear his rights were violated and excessive force was used, and a jury determined that the actions of a police officer caused his death.\n\nDo you think all similar instances, regardless of the race or background of everyone involved, should lead to pardons?

Clearly in this case you feel that they got it wrong based on the publicly available evidence that you'd seen. But the jury decided that there was not reasonable doubt. When do you think a pardon should be given based on the jury getting it \"wrong\" and convicting someone? Clearly the president can do it unilaterally - but they don't have the time to review every single case and determine whether they agree or disagree, clearly this case would be for some kind of political convenience - right?\n\nBasically what I'm getting at is - why THIS case? Should the president go and second-guess all jury verdicts and say \"well I know they found there was no reasonable doubt in this case, but I feel there was - so I'm going to pardon this guy?\"\n\nI don't think this is a hot take, but I think a pardon of Chauvin would be a \"troll\" pardon, in that it would obviously cause a lot of outrage that would be used for political purposes, rather than being a case in which the jury conducted a gross miscarriage of justice (which I obviously don't think they did, nor do I think we should get in the habit of frequently second-guessing juries, since that is the main tool we have to determine reasonable doubt -that's the ENTIRE POINT of having them sit through the trial and hear the evidence...)",

That's fine, I understand TSs aren't a monolith. Your answer, however, was basically: \"he was found guilty, but you can never REALLY know, so he should be pardoned.\" Is that accurate?\n\n\nLike, yeah bud, everything is uncertain and we all get that.
