Are you telling me during the 4 years of Trump 1, all US AID funding was fine and on the up and up? Because I can't find anything from DOGE highlighting waste fraud and abuse during Trump's term.\n\nWhy no uproar about $50 million in US AID funding to \"empower women worldwide\", which was a program heavily endorsed and promoted by Ivanka Trump? February 7, 2019. **Mr. Trump's** administration pledged $50 million to W-GDP \u2014 to be allocated by USAID.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-usaid-cut-threat-ivanka-womens-development-program/\n\nAre we really supposed to believe DOGE is being non biased in what it reveals and promotes as \"waste, fraud and abuse\"?",

The House Budget Committee instructs seven committees to come up with no less than $1.502 trillion in mandatory cuts over 10 years. Notably, for health care, the bill instructs the House Energy and Commerce Committee to cut mandatory spending by a minimum of $880 billion. The Energy and Commerce Committee has primary jurisdiction over numerous health care programs, including Medicaid, and some proposals have been circulating that would enact significant cuts to Medicaid.

                                                    "body": "Well, Trump's plan from his last attempt to run the country (the TCJA) lowered the highest individual tax rate from 39.6 to 37% (if you earned more than $500,000, you get a 2.6 tax decrease -- that's $26,000 tax savings per million over $500,000.  So just randomly, the CEO of Kroger made $15.5 million last year. This Trump45-era tax cut saved him $390,000 in 2023. I guarantee this saved you $0.\n\nHe also lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. It was said that this tax rate lowering would \\*spur businesses to make more money and hire more people\\*. It did not. What it did do was increase profits for shareholders, and encourage stock buybacks. This increased stock prices and made each shareholder own a larger stake of the company. If a corporation's buyback raises the stock price from $35/share to $45/share, someone who owns 10,000 shares of the company will now be $100,000 richer. Add that to an increased \"earnings per share\" because the company pays less taxes and every owner benefits.\n\nThe TCJA also ushered in a brand new deduction for executives paid by S-Corporation, LLC, Sole Proprietorships, structured partnerships (collectively, \"pass through companies\"). These are the sorts of companies lawyers make for real-estate investors, among lots of other beneficiaries. For the past 6 years or so, if you owned one of these types of companies, you got 20% off your income IN ADDITION to any taxes you might pay. So, for every million you made from your pass-through corp, where you used to be taxed at corporate rates, you now get to pretend you only made $800,000 before you get taxed. 20% off the top.\n\nThese things (and others in the TCJA) are up for being changed or renewed in just a month or so -- and you can bet they will remain. Also, it's cost the federal government trillions each year to keep these taxes which only benefit the rich in place. It will continue to cost us....\n\nAre you ok with DOGE savings going to offset the continuation (and perhaps expansion) of these sorts of tax cuts for the wealthy?",

If they sunset the tax rates, reverting back to 2019 rates and keep in place (or expand) the tax breaks for the richest 1%, how will they pay for that? The DOGE savings isn't going to offset that. Certainly, they will get some income from those with $0-$500,000/year incomes since their taxes will go up to what they were in 2019. But they will not be relying on taxes on income from corporations or executive taxes for pass-throughs. \n\nYou said that you'd like the DOGE savings to go to paying down the deficit; but we are incurring deficit at such a high rate, no amount of DOGE savings will effectively pay it down. It will simply slow the bleeding. So, if they leave the tax breaks for the rich in place and pay the deficit down using DOGE-saved funds, we will STILL have a growing deficit.\n\nHowever, if we reversed the tax breaks for the rich (like they will most certainly reverse the tax breaks for the $0-$500,000 earners), we would be able to use the DOGE savings AND the additional tax income to pay the deficit.\n\nIs that the best situation we can hope for??

You cut backroom deals and make dark donations\n\nWhat rule says that 100% of all elites must constrain themselves to the norm of \"backroom deals\" and \"dark donations\"?  I'd argue that while this may be the norm and easier way to achieve financial success for elites, making more money than your contemporaries demands that you push the limits and find new vectors of exploitation.  And there is nothing that says being out in the open in the eye of the public is a non-starter.\n\n>making half the country hate you might be the worst possible strategy if your goal was enrich yourself.\n\nFirst off I'd say that if we are going to agree that half the country hates Elon we must also agree that half the country loves Elon.  If people's opinions are to sway the scales, for every ounce of public opinion you put on one side of the scale there is a second ounce on the other side.  And if you put perspective and lenses in which Elon could be interacting with the world you may find that public opinion means very little.  If 99% of the world hates him yet he only interacts with the 1% that loves him, his world view is going to be drastically askew.",

Nobody is buying it and everyone knows democrats are full of shit on this and are just pretending to be upset because the orange man is behind it.

He was appointed by Trump to his job. There's nothing wrong with political appointments; the government has to get staffed *somehow*.\n\nThe deep state is not political appointees per se. The deep state is the network of unelected bureaucrats who have inordinate, unaccountable power in the government. I gave specific examples. The FEMA staff who pushed funding to hotels for housing migrants in spite of the president's agenda are the deep state. The staff who pushed billions of dollars to a bank in order to disburse it to other programs and agencies to counter Trump policies are the deep state. The FBI staff that leaked ICE raid information to help criminal migrants avoid law enforcement are the deep state.\n\nMusk ran with Donald Trump to do what he is currently doing. People voted on that. DOGE activities and findings are posted daily on X. Musk has more right to claim that he was elected or has popular support for his tasks than, say, Miles Taylor who wrote a NY Times op Ed in 2018 wherein he claimed he and his colleagues were resisting Trump policies from inside the administration.\n\nEdit: to be double clear, so you cannot feign ignorance.\n\nPolitical appointments are not bad. That is not what the deep state is. The deep state is people positioned in the administrative aspects of the government who use their positioning to influence or resist policy or push their own policy regardless of what the American people voted in. It's the office manager inside some personnel department who still practices DEI policies in their hiring. It's the office drone who sees paperwork cross their desk and anonymously leaks it to the press to stir controversy. It's the people like Miles Taylor who have a job they are hired to do and use it as a springboard to run their own agenda and impact US politics from behind the scene with no accountability.",

If someone in a bureaucratic post decides to slow walk a policy, or flags something for additional review to slow its progress, or leaks information to the press in order to generate public outcry they aren't in a position to be held accountable to the American people.\n\nMiles Taylor was purposefully working to resist Trump policies from his position within the Trump administration. No voter got a say as to whether or not they wanted that, no one had any oversight over his actions and he was abusing his official capacity to oppose the elected government and hasn't seen a day inside a jail cell.\n\nNot only is it unethical but it's downright authoritarian for these people to undermine an elected government.\n\nOn the flipside you have the administration staff was quietly running the country while Joe Biden was not cognitively able to do so, including his son Hunter and his wife Jill who were sitting in on everything from cabinet meetings to national security briefs. No one voted for the appointees in the white house to be running the country and there are mechanisms for the president to be removed from office if he is incapable that were not exercised. There is no way for voters to hold those people accountable, and none of those people has faced any consequences for essentially deceiving the American people. \n\nIn some cases the power of these bureaucrats is quite literally unable to be accounted. The CFPB doesn't have its funding authorized by Congress nor does it have Congressional oversight. The CFPB requests funding directly from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve authorizes it. Trump's acting CFPB director canceled a request for nearly a billion dollars in funding from the Fed to the CFPB. That level of unaccountability essentially allows the agency to operate in any manner it pleases with no need to justify or report on its doings.",

He stated there were discussions amongst certain Trump administration officials about invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office. While still part of the Trump administration he anonymously penned an article where he claimed there were multiple officials in the Trump administration working behind the scenes to resist his policies, and also anonymously wrote a book where he divulged information about the Trump administration and disparaged Trump's leadership and decision-making.\n\n> What kind of consequence should he face?\n\nHe should have been fired, and potentially sued or prosecuted for violating non-disclosure agreements. In my ideal world there would be criminal liability for undermining the agenda of the elected leadership through subversion. If he truly felt that strongly about it he should have done the honorable thing and resigned and raised his concerns publicly and transparently.\n\n> How is anyone of that government position supposed to accountable to the people when they\u2019re already accountable to the government?\n\nI don't think you understand what I am saying.\n\nI'm not saying that these positions *should* be accountable to the electorate. I'm saying they are not, as a matter of course. Miles Taylor specifically was appointed to his position but the deep state is primarily the career bureaucrats who sometimes serve for multiple presidential administrations, ostensibly to do a job in a government department but have the ability to influence policy by using the available systems to slow walk, block or resist policies. A government employee who marks paperwork for increased review, knowing that it will slow the implementation of the process, is an example.\n\nThese people should be fired from government and in the most egregious cases be criminally prosecuted. The problem is they often are never even identified. Miles Taylor didn't even reveal his malfeasance until 2020. There are numerous other such subversive actors in government, many of them occupying bureaucratic \"office jobs\" that use their positions and the normal systems of government processes to resist policy.",

The Trump platform was to put Musk in charge of DOGE and for DOGE to make massive cuts. Elon Musk campaigned for Trump on the basis he would be willing to make massive spending cuts for Trump. People voted for the Trump agenda which included DOGE. People voted for RFK Jr, too, who was running on the Trump agenda.

The information they're selectively releasing is such a red flag. They're telling you verbally - through Twitter, the WH press sec, and right wing media - when they could provide verifiable information such as contract numbers, which when looked up on SAM or FPDS, will have statements of work that show you the workload, fixed prices for government furnished property, what materials/software/etc. the contractor will need to furnish, basically everything the contract/program is doing and will do. \n\nThe framing of \"taxpayer money was stolen!\" gets people's attention and they did the same with inflation leading up to the election.

And those are the ones we know about.  There will be more than those and further more those who get payment via a circuitous route.\n\nWhat soft power did Obama get for air dropping a cargo plane load of cash?\n\nNope.
