This is also the single largest line item in the entire 2025 procurement forecast for the State Department.\n\nTrump previously railed against Biden's plan to modernize the US Postal Service fleet with electric vehicles. How do you feel about this planned purchase order? Does this appear to be a reward to Musk for his support?",

Tesla was the only company who responded. Someone put their name in a spreadsheet row. No contract was awarded, the Trump administration was not involved. It\u2019s just\u2026a complete non-story. \n\nThe U.S. government has not awarded Tesla a contract to produce \u201carmored\u201d electric cars, a State Department spokesperson said Thursday, clarifying a budget document that appeared to detail the agency\u2019s plan to spend $400 million on vehicles from Elon Musk\u2019s automotive giant.\n\nThe spokesperson told MSNBC that the Biden administration asked the State Department to \u201cexplore interest from private companies to produce electric vehicles.\u201d In response to the request last year, the agency asked for information to \u201csolicit interest.\u201d\n\nThe department got interest from only one company at the time, and, as a \u201cnext step in that process,\u201d an official solicitation would have been sent out to vehicle manufacturers to bid, the spokesperson said. \u201cHowever,\u201d the spokesperson added, \u201cthe solicitation is on hold and there are no current plans to issue it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe budget document cited in various news reports was a procurement forecast for 2025 \u2014 essentially a list of prospective purchases. The spreadsheet entry, labeled \u201cArmored Tesla (Production Units)\u201d and last modified on Dec. 13, before Trump took office, noted that the potential purchase was still in the \u201cPLANNING\u201d phase. It did not specify the model of car from Tesla, which does not manufacture an \u201carmored\u201d vehicle.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna192034",

Our mailmen don't deliver packages to potentially hostile foreign territories or dicey diplomatic missions. \n\nIf they did then I'd be all for giving them whichever armoured vehicle platform the Post Office staff chose, regardless my thought's on the CEO's politics. \n\nAnd if an Elon hating admin chose the cars the *last* assumption I'd have is the choice was \"a reward to Musk for his support\", lol. \n\nIt's strange that this is either the first or only explanation NS have for virtually everything. \n\n***\n\n>Not only do I think using a Tesla or really any other electric vehicle is a bad idea, I think what they are charging is ridiculous and Elon\u2019s doge group probably needs to take a look at it.\n\nIf you truly believe Biden era State Department employees are fleecing the taxpayer for Elon then why stop at the cars? Let's let DOGE clean out the irresponsible staff as well. I'll agree to that. Do you?",

Honestly, the Cybertruck seems like a steaming piece of crap (check out r\\/Cyberstuck for lulz).  The other models seem small.   I could imagine the Rivian R1S being a modestly smaller swap for the traditional Suburban used in US security details,  but Rivian is not Tesla.   And armoring it would bring the weight *way* up.\n\nI'm all for electric vehicles (I own an earlier model, bought used), but it's still a bit of niche.   Specially designed postal trucks might be one, because the required range is short, and regenerative braking, smooth low speed power, and lack of idle wastage are *fantastic* for stop-and-go, but, again, that's not a Tesla.",

You need a car that has all of the qualities for a VIP car, like being roomy.  \n\nThe standard security vehicles  (SUV class) are the Suburban (0-60 mph in 6s), Escalade (4.4s), Denali (6.1s).    The armored version is heavier but apparently not higher powered (INKAS armored suburban has the same 420HP engine).  So existing armored cars don't prioritize 0-60.\n\nThe Rivian has about 3s so it will beat current armored SUVs (*without* their armor) even if you double the weight by adding armor.   The Plaid Model X is just a tad better (2.5s) and much smaller.    Are you going to fold a VIP like Trump or RFKJr into a soccer-mom car like the Model X?   Then stuff in an assistant next to him? \n\nHeck, the GMC electric Hummer is pretty good too (0-60 in 3.3s, damned close to Tesla plaid), and is much more of traditional security SUV.   And it will stomp over obstacles, compared to any Tesla (oh, forget the Cybertruck - that thing goes out of warranty if you put it into a carwash wrong, or you off-road it, or take it over a pothole).",

Therefore the best security cars should be used i3s.\n\nHeck, I'll take it a step up: I sold a beater for $900 and it could do 0-60 in 12 sec.    This is about 10x cheaper than your Tesla using your favored metric.   Therefore security convoys should consist of used beater cars.\n\nSo, again, why is acceleration per dollar the best measure of car quality, with respect to security vehicles?

At the very least you can't deny that it causes a feeling of corruption, a general distrust of our institutions (you may not feel that, if I take your response as good faith, but the person you responded to you clearly does).  That in itself is bad.  What happened to demanding people who ran for office to make sacrifices? Jimmy Carter's peanut farm and all that?  I mean if we demand NO sacrifice and demand no scrutiny or suspicion, what kind of people are we attracting to the office? Why not attract the best, the ones who are the most willing to sacrifice their material success for the country?",

Is that a correct interpretation of this data?\n\nAlso, I have to ask, where is Tesla mentioned at all in this document?  And what are these vehicles being used for, exactly?\n\nFrom a quick Google search, I'm seeing that (some) post carriers drive over 500 miles each day, which would make EVs less than desirable.  I'm sure many do not drive nearly that far, however.",
