I\u2019m interested in hearing about the role you believe Trump plays in relation to faith and divine authority. Below are a few questions to consider, but feel free to share your thoughts more broadly if you have a perspective on this topic.\n\n* Do you believe someone can oppose Trump\u2019s agenda and still be a good Christian?\n* Should religious leaders who question or disagree with Trump\u2019s policies be considered unqualified, morally or spiritually, for their roles?\n* Would you consider switching to another denomination of Christianity if the leaders of your denomination suddenly dencounced Trump?\n* Do you think Trump embodies Christian virtues or principles? Do you see him as a man of faith?\n* Do you see Trump\u2019s mission as ridding the world of evil, creating a paradise, or saving humanity (or some favored subset of humanity) from the problems that have hitherto defined humanity\u2019s condition on Earth?\n* Do you believe Trump has a unique connection to God that sets him apart from most people? For example, do you think he has experienced divine revelations, acts through divine inspiration, is a vessel for God\u2019s will, or receives direct instruction from God?",

In the Roman Catholic Church priests/bishops generally go out of their way to avoid endorsing specific politicians.  If they did, it would be a huge turnoff.  \n\nThere are priests that preach about the evils of abortion, and priests that talk about being welcoming to immigrants and the poor.  For me being a good Christian has always been about doing personal acts of kindness and charity, prayer, not worshiping material things, focusing on love for God and our neighbors.\n\nIf I steal from my neighbor to take their stuff and help the homeless, it might help the homeless be more comfortable during their short stint on earth, but that doesn't necessarily make me or my neighbor a better person.  If I personally donate to charities that help the homeless giving up my own comfort and convince others to voluntarily do the same, that is a kindness.\n\n* Do you think Trump embodies Christian virtues or principles?\n\nGod, no.\n\n* Do you see him as a man of faith?\n\nNo.\n\n* Do you see Trump\u2019s mission as ridding the world of evil, creating a paradise, or saving humanity (or some favored subset of humanity) from the problems that have hitherto defined humanity\u2019s condition on Earth?\n\nSure.

That said, certain policies or operations Trump proposed does put it up for debate whether or not these leaders have been corrupted by woke ideology or are at least inconsistent. \n\n3. No, Trump isn't the litmus test for my religion, God is. \n\n4. Certain parts of him, yes. Him as a whole, no. Then again most Christians aren't perfect or even a great representation of what a Christian should be. \n\n5. No, I'm pretty sure he's not even a Christian. I do think him almost dying has brought him closer to God. \n\n6. No, Trump is doing his best to fix our countries problem and bring us into a new Golden Age. Christ's mission for us is to change the world. \n\n7. No. I think God is using Trump to do what he's currently doing. I'd say every person is a vessel for God's will when he needs us to be. The political landscape and the country itself changed so much since Trump came into the game. Whatever the reason God put him there, he's done some definite good for the country.",

I don't think Bishop Marian Edgar Budde was in anyway in the wrong with her prayer/sermon/whatever you want to call it.  That said, there are some Christian ministers/preachers/etc. that should be disqualified due to, well, you know.\n* Not a Christian, so not applicable.  My little Temple is pretty apolitical except for a few things, which you can probably guess.\n* I do not view President Trump as a particularly faithful man, in both the secular and religious sense.\n* I view Trump's \"mission\" to be doing the best he can for America, with the added benefit of being able to do some good things for the world.  I would not be surprised if the assassination attempt gave him a bit of a new outlook on things, but I view him more as wanting his legacy to be a shining, golden tower, if that makes sense.\n* According to my beliefs, all are equally connected to the Divine, so long as they acknowledge that.  We can all hear YHWH's will if we listen, but some people choose to listen to the voices in their heads instead.  You can take from that what you will.",

But the one thing idk that Trump supporters necessarily think about is that it naturally gives us influence over those countries by default. Sure, they may not be hitting their targets for NATO spending or UN spending, but if we are, that inherently gives us influence and power over the entire world. Allies and enemies combined. I personally feel like that's worth it. Sure, we have a deficit that's growing, but there's gotta be other things we can cut that don't harm our soft power on the world. \n\nThe problem I'm seeing from the right is that they enjoy the standard of living globalization provides, but they also hate it. I'd be willing to bet most of them wouldn't be willing to make concessions in their standard of living to end globalization. \n\n>I'm okay with that.  I'm also okay with making deals from a position of power rather than a \"reset button\" or anything that has been offered in the past.\n\nWell, then we certainly can't judge Russia and China for doing similar things. Which actually makes sense now. Republicans didn't seem to want to denounce Russia, because they wanted to act like Russia. \n\nI'm still not sure how this benefits anyone except the US, can you explain?",

So that man who got killed while protecting his family is in essence close to God, and the fact that man fired so many shots into a crowd of people but only managed to kill one man is itself a miracle, and the fact that a man who was by all means excellent in his life and in how he carried himself was the man to die was, in my opinion, a huge wake up call to all those who subtly encouraged this act of violence. \n\nUnfortunate that it seems to have only lasted 2 months for many, and we have gone back to \"Trump is literally Hitler\" again, the felon label didn't seem to stick all too well. I can't pretend to know the will of God, but if that was the best outcome to a bad situation I can understand it, but I'm not omniscient. \n\nI think you surviving a surgery is not a good comparison. A surgery is something you voluntarily undergo knowing the risks, presumably because you think the benefits are worth it. If someone instead had a sudden accident and managed to survive and recover despite a low probability, I think they do would feel as though they were saved by some higher power.",

Have nothing to do with such people.\u201d*\n\nI'm sure we won't see eye to eye on all of those things so I've bolded a few which specifically describe people like Trump\n\nI think it's hard to deny the first few when he has literally said things like:\n\n\"The point is, you can never be too greedy.\" from  \u201cTrump: The Art of the Deal\u201d, p.48, Ballantine Books (lover of money)\n\n[Calling himself \"The Chosen One\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JsAQj36gCU) and claiming \"I alone can fix it\" (boastful and proud)\n\nMocking disabled people on live TV and calling places i \"shithole countries\". Kids in cages. Literally bragging about not paying contractors. (abusive, slanderous and without self control)\n\nGoing after those involved in cases against him (unforgiving)\n\nRemoving birthright citizenship (without love, unforgiving)\n\nHis firing and attacks on those who've worked for him and refused to do what he said when it's illegal or not something they can do e.g. Pence  or Tillerson/Sessions who were loyal. (Ungrateful, treacherous)\n\nCalling for violence towards protestors at rallies \"knock the crap out of them\" (brutal and abusive)\n\nAs for \"without self control, unholy, abusive, conceited and lovers of pleasure\" - do we need to talk about all the evidence in the Access Holywood takes between bragging about affairs, \"grab em by the pussy\" etc?\n\nWhile I would agree individually it would not be fair to claim this refers specifically to people like Trump, I believe that the frequency and quantity of examples is relevant. Especially as they span decades and are his own words that are either written by him in Tweets, official documents and his books; are on video; and are corroborated and added to by numerous people from family members to former employees.\n\nIf you would disagree, can you explain how you reconcile this? I will concede it obviously does not name him but it seems very clear that it is warning people about people like Trump in no uncertain terms and I would like to know your rationale for disputing - can you share it?",

            "body": ">Do you believe someone can oppose Trump\u2019s agenda and still be a good Christian?\n\nOf course.\n\n>Should religious leaders who question or disagree with Trump\u2019s policies be considered unqualified, morally or spiritually, for their roles?\n\nIt depends on why they are opposed to Trump's policies and which policies they are opposed to. \n\n>Would you consider switching to another denomination of Christianity if the leaders of your denomination suddenly dencounced Trump?\n\nI'm a low church Protestant Christian, so it's not really as relevant question to me as some others. We don't have strong denominations. I currently attend a Southern Baptist church. Our pastor doesn't discuss politics outside of where it intersects with normal evangelical theology, such as religious liberty, gay marriage, or abortion. I would find it weird if he specifically endorsed or denounced a President by name. The only time I can recall any pastor mentioning a President by name is in prayer that the President would be guided by God. That said, I wouldn't leave if he did denounce Trump for a specific reason on occasion. If bashing a politician became a normal part of the church identity, I would go to a different church.\n\n>Do you think Trump embodies Christian virtues or principles? Do you see him as a man of faith?\n\nI think Trump has always been a Christian, if you define Christian as someone who believes in God and practices the Christian religion. I do think his time in politics has made him more religious and a man of faith. Obviously, Trump's life has not embodied Christian virtues or principles in many cases, and he's often paid a price for his sins.\n\n>Do you see Trump\u2019s mission as ridding the world of evil, creating a paradise, or saving humanity (or some favored subset of humanity) from the problems that have hitherto defined humanity\u2019s condition on Earth?\n\nNormal Christian teaching is that it's not possible to rid the world of evil, create a paradise on earth, or save humanity from it's current condition. That said, normal Christians do believe that it's possible for God to work through Earthly leaders to accomplish good for a subset of people. Trump says he believes God placed him as President to save America. I can't know whether that's true of not, so I'm not going to take a position on this belief.\n\n>Do you believe Trump has a unique connection to God that sets him apart from most people? For example, do you think he has experienced divine revelations, acts through divine inspiration, is a vessel for God\u2019s will, or receives direct instruction from God?\n\nI doubt Trump has a unique connection to God, has divine revelations, or receives direct instruction from God. I don't think he has ever claimed such things. Whether he acts through divine inspiration or is a vessel for God's will is impossible to know, though most Christians do believe that God does act through people in this way.",

Its unclear whether Hitler was simply a man who disliked Christianity but used it rhetorically or if he was more antagonistic towards Christian institutions at the time and was a Christian himself. But I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole historical argument to be had there and, as with anything Hitler, Getting to the truth of it is very difficult because of his elevation as the chief civilizations antagonist of the West since the war. \n\nBut really, I\u2019m not sure what it means to have any special connection with God. Obviously, though, the context of my thought there as a Trump supporter and not detractor is that he\u2019s a positive world historical figure. I didn\u2019t mean to imply that every world historical figure is an instrument of God.",

Or are you thinking that's something that's still counting as sinners gonna sin? He used Christianity as a tool to satisfy his means, just like he used anything else. Prominent nazis were more into occult stuff,  then Christianity. \n\nI think my opinion would just be, that if you start counting one political figure as a special thing send from God or with a special connection to God, because he became a political figure, you kinda have to assume all of them were this way, I guess, no matter if they did somethingpositive or negative. Or do you think it could be, that just some are special to God?",
