(From England, 1 of the 4 constituent countries in the country that makes up the United Kingdom. England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland in addition to other territorial lands like British Virgin Islands)\n\n\n\nHis religion is CHRISTIAN because idk he chose to believe in that. \n\nI hope this has made it more clear so you can have more impactful conversations?

Now, actually, Biden threatened the same thing regarding gun laws and took Missouri to court over a similar issue so this is one of those times that partisan politics cannot have the moral high ground. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that Ronald Reagan threatened to pull federal highway funding over the alcohol age limit unless they all raised it to 21+, so this absolutely isn\u2019t anything new and other presidents have done it. Do I like it? Eh not especially, but it is legal and it is effective. Now, I would prefer to see this power exercised to force the states to respect constitutional rights. For instance I fully believe that blue states that have laid waste to the second amendment should lose every dime of federal funding until they quit acting like tin pot dictators (actually I believe those lawmakers and governors who so egregiously violated the people\u2019s constitutional rights should be exiled to a deserted island but federal funding should bring them to heel just as well).\n\nLargely I think government has very few legitimate powers and they should be used to protect rights and property, BUT I also believe that if a state is failing to perform those tasks then they should be corrected. The issue is that too much federal authority causes misery for us all, but too little and it will cause misery for some of us, because state governments that end up with too much power will be just as authoritarian.",

We read that case (South Dakota v. Dole) in law school, but we also read Sebelius (the affordable care act case), which distinguished Dole and clarified that there are limits to which the federal government can coerce states by withholding funds. Under Sebelius, your proposal for punishing second amendment violations would not pass muster. It is also worth pointing out that Congress, not the president, has the power of the purse, and it was Congress\u2019s authority at issue in Dole. Have you read Robert\u2019s opinion in Sebelius?\n\nAnd states are \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d They are more responsive to their citizens than the fed, and if the citizens of a state don\u2019t like it, they can either vote out their state politicians or move. I hear what you\u2019re saying about the oversight role of the federal government, but that\u2019s an extremely slippery slope, and I personally don\u2019t think this rises even close to the level of justifying federal intervention.

So here are my thoughts on this as a lawyer. \n\nOn the one hand, by specifying \u201cillegal protests,\u201d Trump has really limited how far this policy will reach. Public universities are subject to the Constitution and, among other things, the Tinker test (aka substantial disruption test) created by the Supreme Court establishing when schools can limit a student\u2019s free speech. So a fair number of \u201cprotests\u201d won\u2019t be \u201cillegal.\u201d \n\nOther the other hand, if protests are \u201cillegal,\u201d the universities may just be unable to stop them without serious safety risks, and punishing them by withholding funds that could go to security only worsens the problem. And given that the Constitution doesn\u2019t apply to private universities, it\u2019s hard to say just how many protests at those schools will be \u201cillegal.\u201d In any event, the Constitution is more concerned with regulating the restrictions on protesting rather than the protests themselves, and as far as I know, there are no federal statues governing protests at state or private universities. It would be strange indeed to punish a state university by withholding federal funds based on the violation of state law (which itself could just be changed to allow for such protests and, absent federal legislation/preemption of police powers typically reserved for the states, there\u2019s nothing Trump could do about it). It just seems unworkable and ill conceived. Also, the selective enforcement of immigration policies based on political speech is worrisome. \n\nMy broader concern, though, is that this sets a dangerous precedent for free speech. It makes me think of the \u201cFirst They Came For\u201d piece written by Martin Niem\u00f6ller. Or, like my constitutional law professor once said, you may agree with a particular abuse of power because it is targeted at behavior you don\u2019t like, but that is shortsighted because one day the precedent set by that may be used against you. For example, if Democrats win the next election, what if the next president uses similar measures to silence Republican viewpoints? The second someone objects, the Democrats will cite the precedent set by Trump, which will be hard to argue with. In my mind, even though I largely agree with the sentiment, I think the precedent being set is more dangerous for free speech than it\u2019s worth.",

Another way would be to read the words: \"illegal protests\". There is no first amendment protection for unlawful protests. If protesters are trespassing, vandalizing, or ignoring lawful orders to disperse, they've already lost 1A protection. No change here except specific, enhanced punishments for illegal activity.\n\n>Would you support an Executive Order issued that does this?\n\nThat does *what?* Curtails protected speech? No, I wouldn't support that. Would I support an EO that expels/deports/arrests students who fight cops, vandalize statues, and harass students for their ethnicity or nationality? Absolutely.\n\nHell, I'd support an EO that makes it illegal to wear masks at a protest, and that actually *does* curtail 1A rights.\n\nThe benefit of concealing your identity doesn't outweigh the risk to public safety, and face coverings have allowed agitators to escalate peaceful protests into violent brawls way too many times over the past decade. I've seen it from black bloc, I've seen it from Proud Boys.\n\nAnarchist or Klan, face coverings need to go.",

Any law created to define \u201cillegal protest\u201d is, by definition, a first amendment violation, as the amendment clearly states no law can be made abridging the freedom of speech.

There are many reasons (laws) that prohibit you from protesting.  You cannot just protest anywhere, anytime, anyway.   The purpose of the EO would be to enforce those laws such as the university protests from last year.  The protesters were impeding students from going to class and trespassing after the school said they must leave yet some schools just allowed it for weeks.   This just ensures that it is clear there will be consequences for those actions.",

I didn't like his handling of Libya (among other things), so I didn't vote for him in 2012.\n\nI voted for Trump in 2016. I was *very* disappointed in his weak handling of the summer 2020 riots, so I didn't vote for him in 2020.\n\nBut I look back on any of those initial votes as \"mistakes\". Bush's mistake in Iraq could have been made by Gore. Obama was a better option than McCain. Trump was a better option than Hillary, and it's unlikely she would have been stronger on the riots. All appeared to be the best options at the time - and that's what you vote for.\n\nWe can only guess at the future.\n\nIn 2020, Trump was a better option than Kamala. And more importantly, Trump was an important rejection of identity politics and fringe-left lunacy that has been unchecked in American culture for too long.\n\nTrump was the best option at the time. Will he do something that makes me wish he wasn't president? Sure - I wish he wasn't president now. I wish we'd had a perfect candidate. But we didn't. We had Trump and we had Kamala. Will he do something that makes him lose my support?\n\nHe certainly *could* - he has in the past. His handling of the 2020 loss was pathetic and I was frankly embarrassed for him.\n\nBut the Dems overplayed the Jan 6 riot, they made it the lynchpin of their campaigning, they doubled-down on hysteria about \"saving Our Democracy\", and ultimately they ran someone who was worse than Trump.",

The *election* of Trump was an important shift in the cultural zeitgeist of America. A wakeup call to media & business that the majority of Americans (or, more specifically, a majority of the electorate) were tired of \"woke\" ideology being shoehorned into daily life & culture.\n\nIt's not about government policy - it's about the message. And based on media policy changes post-election, the message was received.\n\n>Do you have an approximate period of time in which you believe this \"lunacy\" has been left unchecked?\n\nPockets of dumb shit started spilling into mainline culture around 2015-2016, but it really became mainstream and normalized in 2020.",

What about if some people act badly, in an otherwise peaceful protest, but more than just the bad actors are detained? If you think this scenario is unfair or \"bait,\" how do you think it's implausible?\n\nI'm raising this hypothetical b/c I see it as a fairly likely scenario: economic situation gets bad, people lose their patience and freak out, trump points to a few violent protestors and says the leftists are out of control, army is mobilized + mass detentions occur, republicans support it on the surface b/c the protestors are breaking the law, but in reality most protestors are peaceful and really they just want to seize more power and squash civil disobedience.",

This is certainly a\u00a0legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, it is rather strange and\nparadoxical to find us consciously breaking laws. One may well ask, \u201cHow can you\nadvocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\u201d The answer is found in the fact that\nthere are two types of laws: There are just laws and there are unjust laws. I would be\nthe first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral\nresponsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey\nunjust laws...\n\n> ...Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality\u00a0is unjust...\n\n>...There are some instances when a law is just on its face but unjust in its application. For\u00a0instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now there is\u00a0nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when the\u00a0ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the first amendment\u00a0privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust. I hope you\u00a0can see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or\u00a0defying the law as the rabid segregationist would do. This would lead to anarchy.\u00a0\n\n> One\u00a0who breaks an unjust law must do it openly, lovingly . . . and with a willingness to accept\u00a0the penalty.\n\nBut what is happening is not just the government arresting people once they have broken a law. Protesting students are willing to go to jail.\n\nTrump is declaring a\u00a0vague pre-emptive punishment for an institution in the public discourse. And this includes punishments that have nothing to do with the law.\n\nIn theory- a student could get arrested for trespassing but the school decide this is not grounds for expulsion. This would mean they would be financially blackmailed to make the decision Trump wants.\u00a0\n\nThis is why this is very wrong to me. This is authoritarianism. Squashing the ability for citizens in a free society to make their voices heard in the face of injustice.",

Trump trashing our allies and making worldwide conflicts more likely can have an impact on me and my family. Firing all these federal workers (my sister and one of my close friends work in the government and they work their asses off - definitely not a leeches) impacts people I care about.\n\nSo those hearings? Meh.  What's going on right now? Yeah I'm paying very close attention and I'm not liking anything I'm seeing.\n\nSince I'm here to learn: what's your favorite part about the DOGE cuts?
