Even if the federal government just prints SS out of insolvency, it won\u2019t matter because the payment would be made worthless via inflation. \n\nThat\u2019s where I say make it credit or a deduction on your taxes. The federal government loses some revenue, but SS remains solvent longer which means the federal government doesn\u2019t have to fund it via deficit spending. \n\nAlso I like to point out the the poorest cohort (millennials) is subsidizing the wealthiest cohort (boomers).

I don't interact with Trump Supporters much in my life, so I come to this subreddit to gain insight and it's hard to know how representative this subreddit is of the general population. It's kinda rare to see an opinion like yours (even asking and debating other TS) so I too don't know how much of these are bots, foreign actors, or even trolls (those who don't care about Trump, and those who do support Trump but would rather get a rise out of a interlocutor than thoughtful discussion).\n\n>Do I trust?

I would no longer trust that doctor for ANYTHING. I wouldn't tell people, \"well the rash is gone, so...\" The solutions suggested by Trump weren't to investigate, improve, reduce, and solve our governmental problems. They were just cut, close, fire and dismantle large government institutions; has there been any reassurance of the implications of all this? Tariffs on your Canadian allies? Leaving NATO and calling Zelensky a dictator and praising Putin? Voting with Russia and North Korea? This is America now? Is the chaos and uncertainty here really worth the end-result?\n\n> If you see the videos of town halls, THOSE are real TS. They voted and supported him. I was one of those people in the town hall. We yelled \"we voted for you, we voted for Trump!\" when our congressman tried to washed our concerns over and called us paid Democrats. What the actual fuck? He lost my respect. (Not dropping names as not to dox myself).\n\nThank you for going to meet your politicians and attempting to hold them responsible. I don't see that often and no matter what side you're on, that's absolutely commendable. Unfortunately, I just don't see this as being effective anymore. I don't see the Republican party doing ANYTHING is constituents want if it's not aligned with Trump. Just listen to Lindsey Graham's comments on Zelensky from last week, to this week. No backbone at all.\n\n>The Republican party is no longer the same after Trump. He does have a strong personality which make things happen. That part is good.

They were supposed to keep things in check.\n\n>Trump and Vance hasn't done that, and I still feel they are respectful to their voters. \n\nPardon me for being blunt here, but are you saying you are frustrated with the politicians who aren't keeping things in check, but aren't mad at Trump for being the one who is actually performing these actions? You can be mad at both though (I know I am). And in fact I'm mad at the Democrats who are barely doing anything at all: voting to approve cabinet positions and then immediately saying they regret the decision because they thought Rubio would stand up to Trump? Like, Rubio? Standing up to Trump? Delusional.\n\nIf you had to take the best of Democrats and the best of Republicans, what would that party look like?",

So yes, the others should be there to help. \n\nBy what metric would you say Trump isn't a politician? Trump was President for 4 years, won the presidency a second time, won the Republican primary 3 times, has had his family involved in government during his presidency, his daughter-in-law was the co-chair of the RNC, has written executive orders, meets with world leaders, and sets the policy for the Republican party seeing as no one gives him any push back whatsoever. He full-time job is not a media personality, TV host, or real estate business man. It's President of the United States. Why does Trump always get, not the benefit of the doubt, but is given absolute zero accountability.\n\n>I mean if you guys want to try to impeach him again, why don't you now? It's a good a time as any. But you can't cuz Trump is skating that line, and he's in the clear. \n\nYou may disagree with me here, but would you allow for the possible interpretation that the reason Trump wasn't impeached isn't because he's in the clear, but due to the mismanagement and dereliction of duty by our congress people? McConnell himself has said he didn't vote to impeach not because he didn't think Trump was wrong, but because \"I didn't get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference.\" And as you yourself has said, Republicans are just falling in line, rather than giving any push back at all.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. It's not often on here I see a Trump Support actively espouse their issues with Trump, and to other Trump Supporters at that. I don't meant to be arrogant or expect you to say \"Oh you're right. I hate Trump now.\" And I apologize if I'm coming off that way. But I'm curious if someone like you who is starting to see cracks, take this as a one-off, or indicative or potentially larger issues down the road?\n\n>Some do stupid shit like Biden on the pickup truck. Whatever, both sides do stupid things to undermine their own cause. \n\nYea, it's all stupid shit. I try to separate my issues with Trump from the online discourse of those who support him, but whether you know this or not, it's very unlikely the true reasons we're upset or concerned about Trump is the political jokes other people make.",

Others don't, but the national social safety net exists and at least allows them to retire, albeit often uncomfortably due to low payouts. \n\n2. There's no social security - everyone is responsible for investing their own money themselves. Some folks do great, and we end up with a mess of old people living and dying in the streets. \n\nI'm personally okay with option 1, despite knowing that the money I contribute to social security isn't going to make as much as I might in the market, because I don't want to live in a society that just casts off old folk to fend for themselves. I also recognize that not everyone feels the same. My questions to you are:\n\nDo you view the above as the only options here, or is there a third option that the right is pushing for? If you're in favor of option 2, why are you in favor of it?",

They could be the most impactful human alive, yet still not have a group that wants to financially care for them. Emotional support and financial support are two very different things.

Completely dismisses the actualy litegitmate complaints and concerns we have. It's not fair for either side to do it. But they do.\n\nI need to ask a question here, so I'll rephrase my original one. I think there are certainly city folk who are living it up in high-rises. And in my experience, they are absolutely not representative of city-folk. They just happen to live there.

This creates business continuity risks. \n\nIn regard to the $106k number, I would expect a contractor in an equivalent role to make $120k+, as they purchase their own insurance.

It is much cheaper to buy a poor person\u2019s vote, as the money has a more meaningful impact on their life. \n\nWe have observed our government doing exactly that.

The nefarious thing about that?\n\nIt equates to taking tax dollars from one taxpayer to buy votes for policies that harm them. I do not believe anyone is deserving of help at the harm of another individual. How that harm is measured varies, of course, but redistribution of wealth always harms the sources of that wealth. \n\nThe lower class DOES have more power in the electorate because there are more of them and there is one vote per person as it stands today. \n\nWhy should someone work 3-4 months of the year for free to support people who have much more free time to spend as they wish? That\u2019s what penalizing the \u201crich\u201d who make over $120k/year accomplishes. I feel obligated to point out once again that $120k/year isn\u2019t \u201crich\u201d in most major metropolitan areas in the U.S..\n\nTo answer your last question: no. I believe we should take the money out of politics and ban lobbying with prison time as punishment for the politicians *and* lobbyists who break that rule. Political Action Committees (PACs) should also be banned and candidates should only be allowed to spend money they raised from contributions to their campaign in this cycle. Campaign contributions should be capped to something like $100, so all Americans can reasonably donate the max amount to a candidate if they so choose. Finally, I think all unspent campaign funds should be divvied up equally and returned to contributors after the election in question. \n\nI do not think it is correct to have policies designed to benefit the rich *or* poor exclusively. I believe in economic equality.",

This connection does already exist through dual credit enrollment at community and technical colleges, but it needs to be strengthened greatly, and connections to employers need to be fostered for more work-based learning opportunities so that we can bridge skill gaps between what employers need and what workers can do.\n\nHowever, I think those things should be done with *more* funding and resources, not less (and yes, improved from what we have now).

Federal funding is braided into a vast number of activities, helps match many programs and activities that help students.\n\nI don't want to dox myself, and I'm not a fed, but I'm literally working on a federally funded program \\*right now\\* to build a new biotechnology program from a high school into a local community college, and I think it's going quite well, with ever increasing student enrollment. Federal funds were used to pay for partnership between high school and a community college, to pay for a new biotech instrument and lab space that the college couldn't afford, and to pay for staff time to teach biotech engagement programs at the local high school. You aren't going to hear about this shit in the national media, but it's happening all the time and is helping students and it\u00a0*will*\u00a0be missed if its cut.\n\nOn top of that, as a policy researcher the DOE's data sources are the data sources I use more than any other, by far, to understand the costs of college, the success of students, and how to make decisions about WORKFORCE pathways (including things like construction and welding). I'm literally using DOE data today, for my job, on infrastructure career pathways.\n\nI guess I'd flip back at you - why do you think education affects poverty? Why are students so unsuccessful in West Virginia for example? I have my ideas but I'd be curious to hear yours.",

States can make up for that. \n\nThat\u2019s neat. I\u2019m sure the state government could fund it, if the state had political appetite for it. \n\nCool. That doesn\u2019t mean the DOE is improving education in any way. \n\nWhy do I think poverty affects education? (I think this is the question you meant to ask, please correct me if not). I think it\u2019s primarily a parenting issue. Children who aren\u2019t being raised right, or not given enough attention, or not being encouraged to do well in school simply won\u2019t do well. The best way to fix this is to localize the solution. The federal government isn\u2019t going to find ways to engage these students all across the country. Students in different areas, with different upbringings are going to find different things interesting, and are going to engage with different curriculums. \n\nFor example, poor students in West Virginia may relate more to welding classes. Whereas poor students in Detroit might relate more to auto body classes.",

I promise some states would suck at it.\n\n\u00a0as of now students can enroll in dual credit classes at a local community college. They could localize that more at high schools but it\u2019s EXPENSIVE to do that. I would also argue that 10-20% of funding (West Virginia is close to 20%) is not something the state just makes up for\u2026 that\u2019s substantial. It\u2019s also more likely to be made up for in wealthy counties with bigger tax revenues. I would argue that funding is currently improving schools from what they would be in the absence of the funding. Also I don\u2019t think states just have extra money sitting around for this without higher taxes.\n\nYou say parenting is the problem but that having classes like welding would fix that issue by giving kids something to relate to. How do you figure that would work? If poor kids are behind by the time they even make it to 1st grade (which is often true), how are welding classes gonna help that? For the record, I think the cultural issues that you refer to do exist for SOME people, for sure, but usually those issues can be traced back to more poverty for the parent - a general lack of wealth and poverty begets more poverty. Parents are bad often because their parents or their schools were bad before. These issues have been building for a lonnnnnng time. And I think an ongoing lack of resources is still the number one issue for most families - in 2018 I visited a number of Mississippi community colleges and one of the biggest issues for them was students not having computers and internet at home.\n\nEdit: god I also forgot about Pell grants which are run by the DOE and I can tell you from firsthand experience is how many students with low incomes pay for community colleges\u00a0",
