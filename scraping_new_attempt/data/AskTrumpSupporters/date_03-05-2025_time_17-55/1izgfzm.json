Our front line workers didn't write bad job descriptions or organization charters. If we're going after people, fire management first. People with enough authority to be held responsible. The people that obligated government funds to these terrible contracts. Vet and promote the front line employees that are just taking the best job they qualified for at the time. \n\nAnd pretty please, go easy on those close to retirement. These are the people that could be eligible for suicide watch if fired.",

I would say the area that is most overdue for audit/cuts is the Pentagon/Department of Defense. I believe it\u2019s been lamented for years that this area of our government has been unable to pass an audit. Why have agencies such as USAID, the CFPB, the Department of Education, etc. been so heavily focused on in light of this? Or do you not agree that the Department of Defense would presumably have been low hanging fruit?  \n\nAnd finally - I read today that 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts are to be terminated.  \n\n[AP News Article](https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16). \n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem audit-like to me.

                            "body": "As far as low-hanging fruit, the Department of Education is easily number one. Multiple teachers in the family, none of which felt the $1700 or so per child in their classroom that the DoE budgets divides into. I believe most would say $0 felt, as they were funding classroom supplies from their own salaries, which were entirely paid by state taxes. Education is incredibly important, which is probably the shield the grifters hide behind with their bloat and corruption. \n\nRegarding the Department of Defense, the low-hanging fruit is the contractors and the federal employees funneling money to them. I have people on my street with stories about multi-million dollar contracts they object to, to which the budgeting office (G-8?) dismissing as \"POM dust\". One acquaintance had a project he didn't know how to fund, but he knew an O-6 in an unrelated unit with $5m they had no idea how to spend. I can't imagine how many failures went with the F-35 program that still isn't terminated. Big or small, the overspending isn't getting examined properly.\n\nConversely, during my time with a line unit in the military, we had a severe underspending problem. No money for ammunition, fuel, printer cartridges, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. Piddly shit, but damaging to morale. Senior NCOs arranging exercises that force enlisted to give up their BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistence) due to training, and then diverting those funds into post-wide senior-enlisted projects. \n\nThe Department of Defense desperately needs an honest audit, not only for stealing from the taxpayers, but also for stealing from active duty military service members. I wouldn't be pointing the finger at anyone with less than 20 years of service.\n\nThe Department of Defense critically lacks fiscal competency, but it cuts both ways. Perhaps if we simply delegated fiscal responsibility to lower levels more often, they might be fiscally competent when they reach senior levels? It seems no one with less than 20 years of experience has anywhere near enough authority to be held responsible for what appear to be massive failures.\n\nRegarding USAID, I love the spirit of USAID and fully believe it'll rebound after the Musk Effect. However, when you look at [terrorists leveraging USAID property](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bzr5DXbCQAA-5Z5.png) or perhaps [these examples](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/at-usaid-waste-and-abuse-runs-deep/), perhaps USAID needs a reality check? I personally know a very good-hearted USAID worker that is quite distraught with USAID being targeted. I do feel for the good USAID workers, likely most of them, who have served in good faith for so long.",

Amazing.\n\n\nLastly, all humans, companies, departments and even governments make mistakes, even courts make mistakes. How is this any different? Also, to kinda answer the question I'm not concerned about these mistakes during cuts and to any leftists who are concerned about the mistakes I would simply say this: maybe you shouldn't have voted for the people who created all this government bloat and waste to begin with and we wouldn't have to tear it all down.",

The Left dehumanizes the Right as a matter of standard operating procedure.  Their preferred attack is the man and not the issue.  (Because they'd lose on the merits of the issue.)\n\nBut to your specific question, I think to say NPC is dehumanizing term would be to beg the question which came first?  The label or the behavior that spawned the label.  I submit the label wouldn't have stuck and struck such a chord if it wasn't mirrored in reality.  If that's true then the Left have already dehumanized themselves by acting in such a way, have they not?\n\nThat's nothing compared to how the Left characterizes their own.  I can think of no greater insult that has stood the test of time than \"useful idiots\".\n\nAnswer B:\n\nIn a population of millions, it's easy to find some examples to support almost any random narrative.  Stereotypes typically perpetuate only if there's a common enough observable occurrence to reinforce it.\n\nThe level of homogeny among the Left is extremely notable and observable.  A good number of people outsource their thinking to the media and a greater proportion of the Left do this than the Right.  This is to be expected since there are two Rights and one Left in the political spectrum, since it is most accurately defined as a political trichotomy.",

                                    "body": "I take your point\u2026 given people who lean left feel what you just described to the right. \n\nI would like to debate however, your statement of \u201cnot a single one of them can answer why.\u201d I\u2019d be happy to discuss my \u201cwhy.\u201d Here are just a few examples of my concerns.\n\n- He prefers \u201cloyalists\u201d as opposed to actually qualified people for incredibly crucial jobs in terms of our national security. With little to no vetting.\n\n- He actually claimed Haitians in Ohio, eat their neighbors cats & dogs. When pointed out there was no evidence to that, he actually doubled down saying it was fact because he \u201cheard it\u201d \u201csomewhere.\u201d\n\n- He\u2019s called for journalists that \u201cquestion him\u201d or \u201cmake him look bad\u201d to be jailed.\n\n- Suddenly he has the audacity to say that Ukraine invaded Russia? Like we\u2019re all stupid & haven\u2019t been paying attention the last 3 years? Most people on either side of the isle support Ukraine (even if you personally don\u2019t.) That statement was embarrassing. I think even you can agree, that both sides of the isle don\u2019t like to be treated like we\u2019re freakin stupid - no matter what side is in the White House.\n\n- For those who voted for Trump, for the first time in history\u2026.. does it bother any of you that Musk has essentially taken over AND EVEN TALKS OVER TRUMP during press conferences & interviews - even straight from the Oval Office? Last I checked, y\u2019all voted for Trump, not Musk. This makes Trump look weak. The left certainly doesn\u2019t like Trump\u2026. But you can see why the left feels unsettled that someone who was not elected in any capacity by the people at all, seems to be running almost the whole government now? Most of us accept Trump won, despite our personal feelings. But would you agree that mostly nobody on either side signed up for Musk, & his nonsense? \n\n- During the interview where he said he\u2019d be \u201cdictator for a day\u201d his FRIEND Hannity all but begged him to retract that statement\u2026. & he still doubled down. You have to see why that may be alarming at the least, not even to the left\u2026. But undecided voters too.\n\n- His Covid handling was tragic\u2026. Frankly, I think that\u2019s the ONLY reason he lost the 2020 election. If he just kept his mouth shut, instead of spewing insane stuff on a daily basis - he would have had that election in a nutshell. The only reason why he won again this time around, is because democrats are weak cowards & everyone was reminded of that again. Dems made some progress while in office, but for every progress they made - they did 10 things severely off putting to Americans. \n\n- You may not agree or believe it (most of us saw it unravel LIVE on television as it was happening) before right wing media spun it into some antifa BS\u2026. but Trump is largely responsible for the disaster of January 6th. Democrats or antifa DID NOT storm the capital\u2026 it was HIS supporters. Still don\u2019t think so? Why did he pardon basically anyone who was convicted? If he thought what happened was wrong, why did he pardon those convicted based on actual evidence? Why did he pardon people who actually CONFESSED\u2026.. other than that they were what? Loyal to him? That\u2019s not on the left. That\u2019s a CHOICE trump MADE.\n\n- He praises dictators & is making enemies of our closest friends & allies. You may not want to admit it, but America & democracy has only been as strong as it is\u2026. Because of our allies. We didn\u2019t get here all by ourselves. It\u2019s devastating to see how he\u2019s treating Canada, Greenland, Denmark (even said he\u2019d be willing to use military force for his agenda) AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE ALWAYS HAD OUR BACK, FOUGHT WITH US IN EVERY WAR, COMES TO OUR AID DURING ANY MAJOR NATURAL DISASTER (despite his stance on Mexico\u2026.. hundreds even came over to help with the most recent devastating fire in California.) \n\n- To the last point, it truly feels like he has no regard for anyone but himself. I know his supporters think his words & actions that affect not just Americans, but nations worldwide make him a \u201cstrong man.\u201d But anyone who doesn\u2019t support him just sees an utter lack of awareness & straight up greed.\n\nI don\u2019t think Trump is a Nazi, I just think he\u2019s an idiot.\n\nTo wrap this up, even if you don\u2019t agree with some or all of my points\u2026.. a lot of us aren\u2019t just \u201cnazi racist barf barf fascist dictator blah blah.\u201d Our concerns are valid. & I hope you are smart enough to at least admit that it can\u2019t possibly be true that EVERY POINT I MADE is just FAKE news. 90% of what I said, is stuff we heard him say from his own mouth or witnessed him do. Happy to link actual videos of all of this straight from him (not edited clips, but full speeches, rally\u2019s, interviews etc.)\n\nSo yeah. I take your point that the left does say this dumb stuff that\u2019s regurgitated. But some of us are paying attention too, we just think differently from you - & have very valid concerns. Just like the right regurgitates dumb maga stuff - but those paying attention on the right don\u2019t spread all the nonsense either.\n\nHave you considered that people who lean left are not your enemies? Do you believe that both sides practically want the same thing such as boarder security, lower taxes, seeing what we pay in taxes actually come back to the people, less government waste, better education, cleaner environment, a fix of our messed up justice system, freedom, fair wages, gun rights, the social security we paid into already, & that everyone deserves a FAIR shot at a comfortable life? \n\nBecause believe it or not, the left wants these things as badly as the right for the most part. \n\nDo you think the reason the country is so divided, is because our media & politicians on BOTH sides would rather cultivate culture wars about things that don\u2019t really matter, to keep us divided & stay in power?",

The estimate for FY2023 was $236B, and it included other sources besides Medicare, Medicaid, and SNAP (though they were part of it). As you said, these improper payments were identified last year in [a memo](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-107482.pdf) from the US Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency that has been making cost-saving recommendations and identifying wasteful spending for many years. It's a part of the executive branch and the Comptroller is appointed by the president.\n\nThe report is dry as hell, but it actually does a good job drilling down on the reasons for the improper payments and recommendations for remedying. (Most are not fraud, but rather missing information in databases or validation errors.)\n\nWith this in mind, what is the point of DOGE? Why is it necessary to have a new department that is duplicating these efforts, but making more mistakes and not offering solutions, but rather (attempting to) shut down entire departments because of purported \"fraud?\" Why not put resources toward remedying the issues that USGAO already identified with their several-months-long audit? \n\nI would posit that it's because the goal is not really about eliminating \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\" That might be a happy side effect, but the real goal is to create chaos, drive the narrative that the government is largely corrupt/fraudulent with the American people, and then centralize power.

                                                    "body": "I appreciate your forward answer. I don\u2019t want to assume - but based on your stance\u2026. Would it be safe to assume you are (or at least lean) towards libertarian?\n\nI\u2019m not sold on abolishing taxes, but I understand the sentiment for a lot of Americans - considering how much we\u2019ve seen our tax dollars go to waste over the last several decades, & how much so many Americans suffer as a result of that waste.\n\nWaste & abuse aside - while I don\u2019t agree to my taxes funding needless wars for agendas that don\u2019t represent most Americans, I don\u2019t agree with how (while low, but some) taxes are funded for illegals (& to be clear my problem isn\u2019t with most immigrants\u2026. The system in place to allow immigrants to be here is corrupt & needs hella fixing), I don\u2019t like that my taxes go to subsidies for corporations that make millions already if not billions, bailing out banks who only needed bailing out to begin with because of their own greed etc you get the point\u2026..\n\nOur taxes also fund our fire departments, military, our national parks, cancer/disease prevention/vaccines/ other medical research, technology research, NASA, education in general (although the corruption there definitely needs to be looked into, education for Americans is still very important) & so many other things such as:\n\nSometimes life happens & we all hit a down point\u2026 & may need government assistance such as food stamps, or rental assistance\u2026.. (side note, I know a lot of people on the right claim they hate that their tax dollars are used to fund \u201cfreeloaders\u201d or whatever\u2026.. but they forget that the majority of these people using these programs, have worked! They have paid a ton in taxes!! It\u2019s not \u201cyou\u2019re money going to them. It\u2019s THEIR money coming back to them\u2026. & the point of paying those taxes on your check is so that they do come back to you, if you are in a bind!! The government is supposed to have your back, because you paid into the system!) \n\nTo touch up on that, our taxes also fund relief for natural disasters & to also be ready & prepared for when pandemics could hit - such as Covid. No matter what kind of society we move to, things will still cost money, or some form of it. If your house burned down in a fire today, or got struck by a tornado\u2026.. isn\u2019t it nice to know the system you paid into will have your back? Not to sound pretentious, but if these emergencies were left to society (especially one as big as ours) we\u2019d likely see a lot more greed & suffering. The organization of government & problem solving here, is important. Frankly I don\u2019t trust an enormous nation & it\u2019s society to not go ape shit & into chaos, without something in place regulating it. I don\u2019t know what form of government would be the \u201cmost efficient.\u201d But it\u2019s important to have leaders in place for emergencies such as this when they hit least expected.\n\nOur taxes also fund police (yes there is corruption there too, but if trained better & corruption weeded out, to have more resources for police in place to handle things situationally, instead of treating every single situation the same reactively\u2026. - I think police are crucial to society) \n\nI personally believe that if my tax dollars are going to protecting Americans\u2026 if the old man down the road gets his leukemia treatment because I paid taxes, if research is funded because of my taxes, of my parks & city is clean because of taxes, if I have a security net in case of an emergency or disaster because I pay taxes so fourth\u2026. I love that my tax dollars are going towards that. & believe it or not\u2026. Both your taxes AND my taxes are going towards that! However, because of the suffering & struggle & the obvious & abhorrent waste - we sometimes forget the good & benefit taxes do too.\n\nIt currently breaks my heart to see so much of the good our taxes do, being gutted. The things I\u2019m proud to pay taxes for, under this administration is being gutted left & right on the daily. & a lot of people support it\u2026\u2026 simply because they are only paying attention to the \u201cwaste\u201d & not the \u201cgood.\u201d So people who lean right see this all as a good thing. I personally don\u2019t see it as a good thing. I think our priorities are a mess because people on both sides of the isle have been mislead, lied to, have been betrayed & have hurt as some point as a result. Both sides feel that pain, it\u2019s just also that both sides are reacting differently. Which is my case & point. Everyone is being reactive, instead of proactive\u2026. & I think both republicans & democrats rely on that.\n\nSo I get the sentiment of no taxes. I get the \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda. I also think the right is lying as much as the left, because both parties think \u201cthem first\u201d - & not \u201cAmericans first\u201d.\n\nIf you saw your taxes going as originally intended to the full extent, would you change your stance on taxes? \n\nCan you acknowledge that taxes at least despite all the negative, also has its place & benefits in society if appropriated reasonably - or do you think everyone should be in a \u201cfree for all whatever happens happens\u201d\n\n& lastly I\u2019m curious your take on social security. I assume you work or HAVE worked - so you\u2019ve already paid into it\u2026. I imagine you want that money you paid back. Is there  comfort knowing that when you retire/are unable to work that you know you have that safety net you paid into? Like you know NO MATTER WHAT, you have at least some financial security when that time comes? \n\nRepublicans have made it more openly clear in the last decade they have no problem gutting SS. I\u2019m 33 & have worked for 14 years. My generation is terrified at this rate, that all that money we paid not only will we not have that security - we\u2019ll be robbed of it - for what will be sold to us as \u201cthe greater good.\u201d I don\u2019t know your age, but I sincerely hope the money you paid into it gets back to you. I hope you hope the same for me.\n\nIs the problem really taxes\u2026 or is it government negligence, abuse, waste & greed - at the expense of the American people? \n\nI get why Americans are fed up, frankly I am too. I just wish we could get to a point where we stop blaming each other, hold our government accountable, & rebuild a better society together. I do think government is incredibly important to make that happen\u2026.. but not like this. Not like how we are, & have been. What\u2019s happening now is not supposed to be our definition of \u201cgovernment.\u201d\n\nBut here we are. \n\nWhat points do you agree/disagree with? \n\nIgnoring for a moment the negatives our taxes go to\u2026. For the systems in place that positively affect what our taxes contribute to - what would you put IN PLACE of those important societal structures - based on your personal beliefs?",

I\u2019m a conservative and I value the Bill of Rights dearly. But for you to understand my perspective I think it\u2019s very important to understand American history with taxes and how we got here. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have income taxes until the Civil War when in 1862 Lincoln signed a law that created our first income tax. \n\nIn 1872 income tax was repealed \n\nIn 1894 the Wilson Tariff Act lowered tariffs but introduced a 2% income tax on Americans and created the first income tax division in US government. \n\nIn 1895 the Supreme Court ruled that income tax was unconstitutional. \n\nUntil 1913 , 90 percent of all govt revenue came from liquor beer wine and tobacco tax. \n\nIn 1913 the 16th amendment was ratified and allowed congress the authority to issue an income tax. A 1%-6% income tax was introduced. \n\nIn 1918 the Revenue Act imposed an income tax structure of up to 77%.\n\nIn 1942 Roosevelt\u2019s Revenue Act passed which raised tax rate to up to 88%. \n\nIn 1943 Congress passed the Current Tax Payment Act which required employers to withhold money from employees paychecks for taxes.\n\nIn 1944 Congress passed the Income Tax Act which raised maximum tax rate to 94%. \n\n\n\u2026 and here we are now. The maximum income tax rate is 37%. Which is thankfully back down to earth from 94% but far above what it *should* be. \n\nIn a few decades we went from income tax being unconstitutional to having a tax rate of over 90%. \n\nWe went from having to go and make payments to the government for taxes to having it automatically deducted before we can ever see it. \n\nPersonally, I think that\u2019s the greatest disservice to Americans ever committed by our government. Imagine if we had to write these tax checks ourselves, filling out the memos with the crap they waste tax dollars on ourselves? There would be riots in the streets. Revolution. \n\nBut instead it all gets taken from us without a say long before we ever have a chance to do anything with that money. We can\u2019t even invest it or let it grow interest until tax time comes. We can\u2019t spend it on food and diapers to get our family by in the meantime. Because that\u2019s how bad the government wants to secure ASAP the money we have earned. \n\nAnd all these tax hikes often happen during times of great unrest, typically being in war times. They take from the American people when we\u2019re most vulnerable. Send us off to war for our sons to die and minimize our paychecks to increase government revenue and power.",

Look at the Hawaiians who lost their homes and got $700. Look at the North Carolinians who lost everything and got a few hundred dollars and delayed emergency relief. It isn\u2019t a funding fault, it\u2019s the fault of a bloated administration eating all the funding with bureaucratic administrative nonsense. So a majority of money ends up in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of the government and rarely makes it back to the actual taxpayer. \n\nI\u2019ve recently experienced natural disaster first hand & it wasn\u2019t government out here helping people. It was our neighbors and local businesses doing all the work to help. Where were our decades of community tax dollars then? \n\nI truly believe taxes help the government far more than they help the American citizen. \n\nAs far as social security goes- I\u2019ve done the math. If I would have taken that and invested myself my returns would have been FARR better than whatever the government may be able to give me. I\u2019m talking 100x better at the least. \n\nThe government takes it from us because they think they know how to invest it better than we do. And they\u2019ve never once shown me a reason to believe that to be true. \n\nThey just don\u2019t want to lose out on their money. And they want it so bad they made it so they get your money even before you do! \n\nI am the only conservative in my family. I love them dearly and they\u2019re the most selfless loving people I know. \n\nBut they also carry a naivety that the govt is looking out for them when all I\u2019ve ever seen is the opposite. I have family on Medicare, Medicaid, on state care in MN, we have dealt with medical emergencies, natural disasters, you name it.. and the govt has done nothing but made their problems worse.\n\n\nAs far as replacing support services for Americans, I don\u2019t believe income tax is the answer. I ultimately want it eliminated. I could see a consumer/sales tax being a solution. But first we need to clean up the overspending and excess of bureaucratic government so that resources can actually make it to those in need.",

I feel like if you had people that understood how to complete this task it would not be harder.  As far as time, we established we have it\n\n\"If its really necessary then they can hire them back. Looks good to me.\"\n\nDo you think this is the right way to treat people?  Fire them, have them panic about how they will support their family, start to look for new work, claim unemployment benefits, figure out health insurance and then what....a week later? a month later? say \"sorry our bad, we actually need you, so now you have to come back\"\n\nThe name of the department is \"Department of Government Efficiency\"  what part of all of that is efficient?",

But on the other, this is ripping of the band aid.\n\nThe thing is, in politics, no one is ever going to be 100% happy with what you do. And this admin is under a microscope in ways none ever have been before. The media penetration into the inner workings of this executive branch is unprecedented. Some of that is because of the polarization of Trump in general, but a large portion of it is because of the nature of media and the amount of access the average person has.\n\n50 years ago, no one has a fucking clue how many people work for any cabinet group.\n\nThis is the first time, also, that we have had anyone in the oval office who is legitimately concerned with reducing the cumbersome, gigantic nature of the fed. There are SO FUCKING MANY cush government jobs out there.\n\nIt's a known quantity. People know that, once you get hired on the fed some, you will have a cush life and job with great benes. Like... It's a running joke. Always has been.\n\nNow I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be that way there ARE a ton of jobs that are needed, and great, within the fed. And yes, there is gonna be some bloat. But at the same time, wev NEVER really dug into cutting these programs and actually reducing the bloat. We just don't. These positions get created, and then linger forever.\n\nThis deep dive IS a good thing. The rhetoric surrounding it being evil is simply that, rhetoric. People on both sides, for years and years, have lamented the bloated bureaucracy that is the Fed. But then you chuckle and say \"oh well, what are ya gonna do?\" cause it's too fucking big and entrenched to handle.\n\nYes, there are going to be some broken eggs. \n\nWhen should we start to worry? THAT is a hard question. Worst case, do we think he can completely ruin the US government in for years? Nope. All of this is executive action that can be turned right back on by the next guy, if they want. So why not give it a go and really shock the system?",

The control of money is power, so how is consolidating that power into the executive branch not expanding their power base?\n\nAnd to your other point, what corruption are you talking about and could you point to specific examples?",

While they are sometimes used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings:\n\n\n\nDeep State\n\nThe deep state refers to a supposed network of unelected government officials, intelligence agencies, military personnel, and bureaucrats who allegedly wield power behind the scenes, independent of elected officials. The idea suggests that these entities influence policy decisions, slow down reforms, or undermine elected leaders to maintain the status quo. The term is often associated with conspiracy theories but can also be used more generally to describe entrenched institutional power.\n\n\n\nThe Swamp\n\n\"The swamp\" is a derogatory term for Washington, D.C.'s political establishment, including career politicians, lobbyists, and bureaucrats, who are perceived as corrupt, self-serving, or resistant to change. The phrase gained popularity through political rhetoric, especially in calls to reform government and reduce insider influence. The idea is that the swamp is filled with individuals more interested in maintaining power and personal gain than serving the public.\n\n\n\nBoth terms are often used in populist or anti-establishment narratives to criticize government inefficiency, corruption, or resistance to change.",

A Couple hundred? A thousand?\n\nEDIT: \nI just did the very rough math on how much you would save. It would average about $1,600 saved per worker. Not counting any illegal immigrant workers. \n\nAgain, not exact math\u2026 I might\u2019ve not even done the proper formula.  But I took 6.6% (amount of taxes that go to fed employee compensation) of the total federal tax collection for the year 2024 (4.9 trillion) then Divided that number by tax paying workers ( 161,000,000 American workers in 2024. Not counting illegal immigrants) \nAnd came up with that number. I did fail high school math so please be nice.",

Unless you want to live in poverty you don't want most manufacturing jobs to come back to the us. We currently only mess with manufacturing more expensive items here because then the labor can be justified. Back when manufacturing was bigger here we also had much worse working conditions and a lot less buying power. \n\nWhy, when talking about jobs, is manufacturing the only job brought up? What about construction? Biden put billions in to infrastructure, what about those jobs? Our bridges and roads are in terrible shape, what is Trump wanting to do about that? \n\nHow about making college more affordable by having the government negotiate prices with colleges like some countries do and many on the left argue for? \n\nI have worked in manufacturing and I can tell you one of the biggest challenges that American manufacturing faces is that nobody has the training they need. Most places need more than a high school diploma for a lot of their jobs and most people looking for jobs don't have any access to the training needed. Cost and time being the biggest factors.\n\nSo the left tries to help people get that access by putting forth bills to help get people financial aid for the schooling. It gets shot down by the right for being communism. \n\nThe right says to pick yourself up by your bootstraps and nothing happens then they blame the left for not helping. \n\nDid I help you understand where we are coming from?",

If you want to save money, just cut contracts. Don\u2019t touch staffing. Staff is a TINY part of the budget, maybe 2%, the rest are contracts..\n\nA single submarine is more than the entire civilian payroll\u2026 think about that\u2026\n\nThese are people with families, contributing to the economy, and doing it for less than they could on the outside. The people working for the govt truly are the best of the best already - because thousands apply for one opening.\n\nThink about it this way: it\u2019s easier to get into Harvard (by A LOT) than it is to get a fed job\u2026.
