And DEI should cancel that out, make black people as likely to get a job interview as white people.\n\nBut yeah l, equally if it ever was taken too far and actively promoted one ethic group over another that would be DEI gone too far, and I'd be against it. And this is an example of that DEI.\n\nThanks for this. \n\nDo you think most DEI is the difference cancelling kind, or the gone too far promoting a specific group kind?",

Whether it be unrealized bias, or it be straight up racism. \n\nAnd lastly I believe there are systemic issues that are disproportionally affecting certain groups. \n\nBut with all of that. I just cannot get myself to support policies that take things such as race into account. I think it\u2019s inherently immoral so I cannot support it. \n\nESPECIALLY when it\u2019s the government doing it. I think it is completely inappropriate. The government and the law should operate as if race is not a thing. \n\nContext: I\u2019m Asian. I believe me and people I know have been negatively affected by affirmative action. So that\u2019s my bias.\n\nSome other common things that tend to pop up for this topic \n\n- Veterans shouldn\u2019t get priority treatment\n- the way to combat systemic issues without involving race is to address the systemic issues. Give low income families the help they need. If this help goes to 90% minorities, that\u2019s completely okay because the help is not based on race\n- no. Republicans won\u2019t do any of this",

That\u2019s quite literally racism. \n\nI just can\u2019t support that. It fundamentally opposes my view that all races are equal. \n\n> Specifically as it pertains to the government? Just curious.\n\nBecause I can accept that there are racists in the world. Accept as in accept that it is reality. Not only can I not change that (at least from a nation wide scale. Like I can maybe convince a couple of racists in my life). \n\nBut I cannot tolerate that the government is racist. Like I don\u2019t know how else to explain it. The law being racist is so wrong that like I don\u2019t want to be rude but I\u2019m aghast that this is even a question. \n\n> I see that you say you have a bias because you\u2019re Asian.

Or at least get a better grasp. \n\n> Could you see a world where DEI is attempting to combat racism\n\nYeah. It\u2019s why I said nearly 100% of people are doing it for good intentions. \n\n>  as opposed to promoting it by attempting to correct historical injustices and systemic disadvantages (as opposed to just hiring a race because they\u2019re aren\u2019t many of said race)?\n\nSo I think the problem is that promoters of dei is combating racism\u2026. By promoting racism. That\u2019s the problem. \n\n> You don\u2019t believe racism doesn\u2019t exist, but I think one of the discrepancies may be how we view it to currently shape our current society and how deeply engrained it is?

I think. \n\n> So IF there\u2019s a discrepancy there, is there a world where you may see or may be able to understand from a utilitarian view, or some other ethical lens (that I\u2019m not that versed in, excuse me), that DEI is moral? Instead of immoral?\n\nIs there a world? Perhaps. This world, where dei is moral, would need to be completely void of methods in which we can address racism without being racist ourselves. \n\nAnd like I mentioned in my first post. There\u2019s at least one method. Provide help to the ones who do, a criteria of income. Im certain there are more. \n\nIf there\u2019s no way to provide help without being racist. Then yes, I believe I can be convinced that dei is more moral than immoral. \n\nBut in our world, that is not T he case. \n\n> Or is that not something you could see? I\u2019m obviously not asking whether you subscribe to it, I\u2019m just asking can you see it?\n\nAnswered above. Should have included in above. Oh well too lazy to copy and paste it. XD \n\n> Let me know!\n\nThe biggest issue, outside of ethics, is that you are breeding a generation of people (evident of \u201chow blatant the Republican Party is about racism\u201d) who feel that they are actively being discriminated against. \n\nPeople, especially young people, who are at the short end of the stick for dei are not going to embrace equality. Th opposite is going to be happen. \n\nIf you demonstrate that it is okay to be racist. Don\u2019t be surprised that people take that message.",

Walk with me here?\n\nBy *definition*, racism is: \n\na person who is prejudiced *against* or antagonistic *toward* people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.\n\n^ based on definition, and you understanding that racism exists systemically AND individualistically now (and then), can we not conclude that DEI initiatives aren\u2019t there to be AGAINST a group of people, but to then INCLUDE a group of people who were outcasted BECAUSE of the same racism that you agree is currently present? Therefore deeming it not racist, but the exact opposite of racism? Which is in anti-racist? \n\nDefinition 2:\ncharacterized by or showing prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism *against* a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.\n\nAgain, DEI initiatives being racist wouldn\u2019t fall under this category by definition either. Highlighting a group of people to.. let\u2019s say even attempt to properly represent the percentage of the American demographic in the work place would then also be the opposite of racist. It would be inclusion or anti-racist, by definition. \n\nBased on this, can you see where Im coming from if im seeing a contradiction? \n\nThe idea that something can combat injustices (that you agree are there) by *including* those people who have no had justice historically, then cannot be racist by definition, but rather the opposite? \n\nIf that\u2019s something you cannot see, could you present a possible alternative to combatting racism without \u201cbeing racist\u201d?

At least that\u2019s what I think?\n\nI disagree. Language is fluid. People use words differently. Definitions of words change, sometimes people catch on fast, sometimes people adjust slowly. \n\nA very good example is the word gender. \n\n50 years ago gender is man and woman. And many people would have considered a trans woman a woman. \n\nAnd because words are fluid, the definition is now that trans women are women. \n\nThat\u2019s not even my point though. The point is that when we are discussing an idea. The definition doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a distraction from discussing ideas. \n\n> Regardless, I understand your rationale. I think we are at an impasse then?\n\nI Agree. \n\n> I would agree that hiring solely off of race is immoral, though I\u2019m comfortable saying we both agree that\u2019s not the case with DEI due to our previous understandings?\n\n> I would agree that the government making decisions on race solely would be immoral, though we both believe it isn\u2019t the case.\n\nDisagree. That\u2019s like saying if a white power group starts recruiting gang members by these two criteria \n\n- white people\n- people who like rock music\n\nIs this suddenly an acceptable recruiting practice because it\u2019s not solely based on race?\n\nOf course not. And I think would agree that there is absolutely no combination of hiring practices that would be acceptable if one of the criteria is to only accept white people.\n\nThis is what I think about dei practices. It doesn\u2019t matter what hiring criteria you use on top of dei practices. You are being immoral. \n\n> What makes something immoral or not requires definition, and potential nuance that may not be explored here due to your lack of care of intention. Which I now understand.\n\nIt\u2019s true that we need to agree on definitions. I just didn\u2019t feel like arguing about definitions. That\u2019s why I changed it to a definition that I believe we both already agree on. \n\n> I appreciate the conversation. If you\u2019re willing to dive a bit deeper on this, just let me know? If not, please take care.\n\nAlways. I am always open to discussion.",

Things do change, the definition of racism has not.\n\nBut it has changed. There are people out there who think only white people can be racist. \n\nThey\u2019re wrong. But the definition is definitely not as specific as you are explaining. \n\n> Unless you\u2019re implying that the word racism is defined one way right now, but people are slow to understand it the way you do? Surely you cant mean that?\n\nI mean that I think it\u2019s used one way. And you think it\u2019s used one way. And some other people (such as the aforementioned \u201conly white people can be racist\u201d crowd). \n\nThe point is that there\u2019s no logical reason why any word needs to be defined any way. \n\n> Next, a white power group is based in racism by DEFINITION, instituted TO push racial segregation, opposed multiculturalism (racist), and use violence often times to push their agenda. It wouldn\u2019t matter what their criteria is, because they are racist by definition.\n\nThe government is not based in racism by definition either. At least todays government don\u2019t. With this criteria you are saying either:\n\n1. There is no institutional racism \n2. There\u2019s institutional racism but it\u2019s fine because the government wasn\u2019t by definition based on racism. \n\n> Alternatively, it would be okay to have an all Asian coalition, or all black fraternity or sorority, etc (these things also exist).\n\nI think all of these things are racist lmao. Although it\u2019s true that the harm is minimal. Because none of these things are value judgements. Like in the ones I mentioned in my original (or maybe second I can\u2019t remember) post.\n\nIt\u2019s way worse for things such as hiring because they are value judgements. \n\nThe best way to understand my point is this.  \n\nYou know those stories where people go to car mechanics and if they see a woman they refuse the work and ask for a man? BUT there is not an issue when a person is only friends with men or only friends a with woman. \n\nThe former is super sexist but the latter is just kinda \u201cwhatever\u201d right? \n\nWhy the difference? Because things like hiring a person is a value judgement. While who you pick your friends is mostly taste. \n\nAsian only frats or black only frats are racist. But it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d the same reason why dating people of a specific race is \u201cokay\u201d. \n\nHiring people is about how much their work is valued. It\u2019s a value judgement. \n\n> The ONLY reason \u201call white\u201d things are looked down upon is because when that is the motive, it is rooted in racism historically, just like a white power group which is why THEY can\u2019t hire \u201cby race\u201d. Whereas an all Asian business or black owned business could. We have to consider the nuance on why these things exist anyways. They are only immoral when you consider (or don\u2019t consider) the nuance.\n\n> Do you disagree?\n\nI do disagree. I think that Asians only hiring Asians is racist. It\u2019s extremely racist. I know because I\u2019m from sea. People openly mock and put down other races. It is disgusting. And is probably why my views on this is so set in stone. I cannot tolerate it one bit. \n\nIt\u2019s part of why I immigrated here. Because some of my family (and some in laws) are just\u2026. Terrible people. \n\n> Ultimately, I\u2019m curious as to whether or not you CAN see where I\u2019m coming from? Regardless if it\u2019s by choice or not, and IF not, why can\u2019t you?\n\nI can see it.  Like I said in my op. All of y\u2019all are coming from a good place. And I do see the angle. I just disagree. \n\n> If possible, I\u2019m still curious to know what ways there are to combat racism by using initiatives other than the ones in place (I don\u2019t remember if that was answered)?\n\nYup. My idea was just the one from before. Which is to support and give help to people who need it. \n\nWe are needlessly emphasizing that people of different races are different. And should be treated differently. And we are surprised that the country is so divided. \n\n> Oh! I\u2019ll add! If you CAN see where I\u2019m coming from but just disagree, that\u2019s fine too. I say this because I feel like you don\u2019t necessarily see it.\n\nYup. I agree with this whole heartily. There\u2019s not much you can talk with me about that I will straight up not be okay with. \n\nI want to make sure that I mean that I have no problem with your stance. It\u2019s very reasonable.",

My opinion on DEI is that some of the concepts an be applied on a case-by-case basis, I'll give an example:\n\n\nOne of the arguments for DEI in university admissions is that black kids tend to go to worse schools which has a negative impact on their grades. However, since university admissions are always done on a case-by-case basis, they could just look at what school the person went to (and if it was a worse school, add something to the SAT score) instead of just assuming they went to a worse school because if their race, it doesnt make sense.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSimilarily, with refugees we need to look on a case by case basis: are they actually refugees, are they actually in danger?\n\u00a0\nTurns out a lot of them aren't (I saw a study that said 80% of \"refugees\" went back on vacation to their Homeland, if they we're actually in danger they couldn't do that)\n\n\nIt doesn't make sense to prioritize an entire group, the purpose of the refugee program should be to help people whose human rights are genuinely jeopardized.",

It\u2019s a unique situation. If they can\u2019t go other places safely I support taking them in. They are both victims and people who can assimilate easily into our culture.",

While it was right to end that form of government, the end of apartheid directly led to this sort of situation in South Africa as many of the black population still feel animosity to the white population there. I also have a great real of respect for South Africans as their history is pretty similar to ours, both being former British colonies with a significant native population only we basically killed off most of ours so we avoided the problems South Africa has now. If we did not have the Columbian exchange, we would likely have been in the same boat as South Africa",

It\u2019s not their own country committing the persecution against them. And as we all know, given the circumstances it\u2019s very complicated. \n\nIt is up to those with much more experience and qualification than me to determine who or who not is qualified. This is just based on my understanding of US asylum laws. \n\nRwanda and DRC are recent examples of obvious and clear ethnic cleansing that would be eligible for US asylum. \n\nI think a key difference and point to mention is the difference between refugee classes. Asylum seeking refugees whom are actively being persecuted against by their govt clearly meets the US standard for asylum. \n\nEconomic refugees on the other hand, do not meet the criteria the US requires to meet asylum. Just because your home country is poor and lacks resources, doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to asylum. This is because you\u2019re not actively being persecuted against by your government.\n\nThe bulk of international refugees (and illegal immigrants) are not qualified for asylum by US law. \n\nI believe asylum should be granted according to US law. For any qualified asylum seeker. Simple as that. \n\nYes, we should always put America and Americans first. \n\nIt\u2019s not an exception as the persecution clearly meets the legal requirements for asylum in the USA.",

People who illegally entered the country should be deported; end of. They are not *from* that country, nor were they born there, nor did they enter legally.

I would recommend you read up on South African history, it's actually more complicated than you may think",

The Zulu were incredibly brutal killing any boy over 8 and raping the women of the tribes they took over. They pushed the other tribes into South Africa. \n\nAlso I don't understand why leftists seem to be using the term colonizer as a pejorative. Not all white people are actually colonizers (really only British, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese with a couple relatively small colonies with Belgium and Germany). Being able to successfully colonize a country is no small feat and many of the people complaining about colonizers would have done it themselves if they had the power to do so.",

In 1652, Jan van Riebeeck established a small colony on the Cape of Good Hope as a refreshment station for the Dutch East India Company.\"\n\nThere were people there but not Zulu who are the largest ethnic group in South Africa today. They may have lived there before the Europeans arrived but they left by the time the Dutch came only to come back in the 19th century. Before the Dutch came and introduced irrigation, South Africa was much more arid and unable to sustain a large population. \n\n>Do you think that natives were treated better under race-based apartheid than they were under Zulu reign?\n\nYes, because the Zulu genocided them whereas the black population actually increased during apartheid",

My question requires context:\n\n\u201cNo. Zulus are not indigenous to South Africa. However, they are part of a Bantu migration down from East Africa thousands of years ago.\u201d That\u2019s from your source which seems to have conflicting stories. \n\nThe main points as far as I understand are: (1) the Bantu/Zulu did not interact with the Dutch colonies but with the British colonies. (2) Shaka Zulu had a brutal rise to power and killed anyone who challenged his rule including and especially adversarial nations. This is a common thread in many ethnic histories. (3) The Zulu identity includes people who were formerly victims of the Zulu so I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re universally hated. [Source](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-world-history-of-genocide/zulu-kingdom-as-a-genocidal-and-postgenocidal-society-c1810-to-the-present/D706B9ED5CFB7F81057D250ED9333FCC). (4) the Dutch also engaged in [genocide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20941880/). (5) the British engaged in [ethnic cleansing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20941880/) against Dutch and black Africans.\n\nDoes any of this information feel relevant to adjusting your viewpoint, or do you still feel that black Africans generally and Zulu specifically are the only genocidal force in South African history?\n\nFinally, do you have a source for the population growth? Rape is endemic in South Africa, but as far as I\u2019m aware that directly contradicts the assertion that population growth was hampered until the miracle of apartheid? Especially because it seems like rape may have gotten worse under British colonial rule and under apartheid, where black women were ignored?

Roman behavior was remarkably parallel to Zulu behavior, wasn\u2019t it? Both were ruthlessly expansionist, both sacked entire civilizations and murdered the men/raped the women. Both had peoples that joined peacefully and were treated well without being murdered or raped. Zulu genocide has much more in common with Roman genocide (expansion, conquest, empire) than the Holocaust (scapegoating, forced labor, eugenics). What is different between the Romans and the Zulu?\n\nYou are correct that the genocided population doesn\u2019t grow. The point of conquest fueled genocide is to expand the conquering population, which was done very successfully in both the Roman and Zulu cases. In both cases didn\u2019t that happen?",

It's not just the Holocaust that is the only example of ethnic cleansing, but it is one of the few pretty much universally agreed upon examples with a decently tracked ethnic group. You could also probably use the Armenian genocide, but that is harder to track as that is more of a religious group than solely ethnic. \n\nAnother problem with the Roman genocide is that statistics were not necessarily reliably kept during that time period and/or it's harder to track the integrity of the data over thousands of years. Compare that to the Holocaust where the data was actually kept in a meticulous and bureaucratic fashion with tons of people spending their whole lives researching, tracking the Holocaust, which is why I say that is a better example. As can be shown in the Holocaust example, the population shrank significantly, but this is not the case in South Africa which saw massive growth during the time of the \"genocide\", which is why I would say South Africa did not actually suffer a genocide. You can have a bad time without having a genocide",
