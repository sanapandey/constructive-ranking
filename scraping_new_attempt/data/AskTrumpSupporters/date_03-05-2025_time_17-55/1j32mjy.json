            "body": "It's complicated. The unspoken secret is that everyone knows tariffs will probably reduce long term GDP by some ~0.5% and will probably reduce both output and employment in the short term.\n\nBut we also know that the best way to raise the GDP is to close a factory in the US, open a bank and a Walmart instead, and send the factory to Mexico or China. That's what we've been doing since the NAFTA years. Tariffs reverse the process over time: more jobs in factories, less in Walmart. \n\nThey definitely raise funds for the federal government, but not that much considering our spending levels. On the other hand, the impact to households is also largely over-estimated, most households will see <$1000/year in price increases.\n\nIf you just care about GDP growth, want to see more Walmart and Wall street, tariffs are bad. If you want more factory jobs and domestic manufacturing, tariffs might work. Frankly, we don't know, tariffs haven't been essentially non-zero since 1970 and haven't been this high since WWII.",

Thanks for the thoughtful response.\n\nI actually agree with you on the idea that the free trade the US has had since the 70s is great for GDP but doesn\u2019t necessarily help with ensuring labor is valued. Put it another way, GDP is kinda a garbage metric for the overall quality of life in a country, and the US (+ rest of the western world) have been over-prioritizing it at the expense of other aspects of life being undervalued in policy.\n\nI wanted to ask your thoughts on the way the tariffs have been implemented though. If the goal is just to improve US manufacturing base, why cant that be done in a way that isn\u2019t interpreted as an act of war by other countries? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to implement tariffs more gradually and to work with allies so companies have time to adjust? Why are specific trading partners being targeted (most notably IMO Canada or the EU) that don\u2019t have particularly low wages for manufacturing jobs anyways?\n\nEdit: EU isn\u2019t a country",

Biden kept the relatively small China tariffs but Trump didn't get the trade concessions he wanted out of them. All the counterparties know he's out in 4 years, so whatever deals and impacts he hopes to make have to happen quickly.\n\nXi is going to be there for life so he can just wait it out. With Canada it's similar, they've had one party rule for a very long time, and maybe into the future as well. The EU is just totally intractable generally, it can't make any movements under the weight of its crippling bureaucracy unless they have super strong motivation. So everyone needs a shock to light a fire under their administration or they'll just wait Trump out again. This is his last term, so he's on a clock.\n\nCanada is a particularly bad deal for America because you can literally drive from Buffalo or Detroit to Toronto and see all the heavy industry that's left the midwest and just sits right at the Canada-US border. There's only like two bridges that allow trucks, and you can watch the trucks full of processed material roll back into America basically all day, with barely anything going the other way. Just 20 years ago it was totally the opposite. I remember when Toronto was basically a mid-tier US city, now it's arguably the largest metro area in North America. That's all US dollars flowing back north.",

            "body": "Let's start with a functioning system thought experiment. You have a consumer that spends his money locally for all they buy. The consumer gets his money from either owning or working in a local business with a good salary and benefits. That is a functioning win/win transactional system. The money is spent locally and the money that is spent is used locally to pay good wages. It's a functioning closed circle. This closed circle can scale to a national level.\n\nThe circle is working for the nation. People are making enough money and spending enough money that everyone wins. This nation is more prosperous and successful than other nations in the world. Workers are able to work less hours in better conditions and kids can go to school and old people can retire if they wabt to.\n\nNow lets add imports to the closed loop thought experiment. Products that are made cheaply show up in stores and consumers love them except the ones whose livelihood is making those products in the closed loop. The consumers money earned is no longer going back in the loop. That money is going to a different country. Many of the owners of businesses cannot compete and move their business to the place with less cost to produce. Now the loop is missing or has greatly reduced whole sectors of businesses like textile and steel and auto-making. Many consumers have to accept less salary or change jobs. The result is tightened spending budgets, less or no benefits and going into debt. Consumer products are cheaper so life goes on devolving into worse circumstances for each generation of consumer/workers.\n\nThe fix is to introduce tariffs with imports. The cheaper import plus tariffs now compete with circle businesses instead of destroying them. A small percentage of consumer money will leave the circle but that is offset by lower taxes. Consumers never pay cheaper prices so they don't pay higher prices for the tariffs. Consumers always pay closed loop prices.\n\nNow if globalist people  do not like the closed loop and want to destroy it they bring in the cheap goods without the tariffs. If this goes on for a hundred years there will be some consumer price pain while prices adjust back up to closed loop standards.",

Consumers won more before tarrifs are in place. \n\nThe cost of new cars will also increase the cost of used cars - which disproportionately affects working class Americans that rely on them. Even the people building the new Civics. \n\nI\u2019m not against bringing back manufacturing jobs, but I can think of a few ways to do this without price gouging buyers that are already struggling. \n\nWe also have already had a tariff war to draw conclusions from - under President Hoover (Smoot-Hawley Tarrif Act) which only exacerbated the Great Depression.",

That means those products will absolutely increase in price compared to the sources we currently get them from, which is what the user you replied to is illustrating. Do you disagree based on the reasons he stated? My question is why would anyone want to pay significantly more for the same item, thereby increasing their cost of living (all while income taxes are still very real and in-place)?",

Trump\u2019s latest tariffs might sound like a move to protect American jobs, but in reality, they could do the exact opposite\u2014costing jobs and raising prices for consumers.\n\nThese tariffs hit hard: a 25% levy on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus a 20% tax on Chinese goods. That covers a huge chunk of U.S. imports\u2014cars, electronics, home appliances, even food. The result? Higher costs for businesses, and ultimately, for everyday Americans.\n\nTake North American-made cars, for example. Production costs could spike by as much as $12,000 per vehicle, a cost that will likely be passed straight to buyers. Electronics like smartphones and laptops from China? Also getting more expensive. That means consumers will feel the pinch\u2014some estimates suggest an extra $800 a year in added expenses for the average household. In effect, these tariffs function as a tax on the very people they\u2019re supposed to help.\n\nThe job market won\u2019t escape the fallout either. Many U.S. industries rely on imported materials, and when tariffs drive up costs, companies are forced to make tough choices\u2014cut jobs, reduce production, or even shut down plants. Manufacturing is particularly vulnerable. Automakers, appliance producers, and electronics manufacturers all depend on affordable materials like steel, aluminum, and semiconductors. With costs rising, they either have to eat the losses, pass them on to consumers, or downsize\u2014none of which bodes well for American workers.\n\nRetail and consumer goods sectors will also feel the squeeze. Many stores depend on imported products, so price hikes could slow down consumer spending. That, in turn, means job cuts in retail, warehousing, and distribution. The same goes for logistics and transportation\u2014fewer imports mean less work for port workers, truck drivers, and warehouse employees.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget farmers. U.S. agriculture relies on exporting goods, but retaliatory tariffs from Canada, Mexico, and China could make American farm products too expensive abroad. We\u2019ve seen this before\u2014during previous trade wars, farm incomes dropped, and bankruptcies rose. With many farmers already struggling, more trade barriers could push them over the edge.\n\nThe tech industry isn\u2019t safe either. U.S. tech companies operate within global supply chains, and tariffs on Chinese imports will raise costs for key components like semiconductors and batteries. Companies like Apple and Tesla will either have to hike prices or cut jobs to stay profitable. The ripple effect could hit American exporters, too\u2014retaliatory tariffs will make U.S. goods more expensive overseas, leading to lower sales and more layoffs in manufacturing, energy, and agriculture.\n\nBeyond the immediate pain, tariffs fuel inflation, weaken purchasing power, and strain trade relationships. While the intent may be to protect domestic industries, history tells us a different story\u2014tariffs often backfire. They drive up costs, weaken competitiveness, and ultimately hurt the very workers they claim to defend.\n\nSo, if the goal is economic strength, these tariffs may be more of a self-inflicted wound than a strategic victory.",

A U-5 below 5% is **lower** than the target unemployment rate. A U-6 of 7.5% is very low, the long term average is 10% and the lowest it has ever been recorded was 6.5%. So again, we have extremely low unemployment rates, almost to the point where it actually becomes a problem economically, why do you think we should start trade wars and hurt our relationship with allies and make everyone pay higher prices for goods to lower these rates even more?\n\nAlso how exactly do you think adding more full time jobs will reduce part time jobs? Are McDonald's going to close down because factories are opening? And how is this worth starting conflict with allies and raising the prices on goods for all Americans regardless of whether or not they are full time or part time?",

Despite what the data says, you believe we have too many part time jobs because vibes. That's fine.\n\n> I think you're missing the forest for the trees here - the tariffs are in response to other countries' export tariffs on us. \n\nCan you link this to me? I'm not aware of this. I'm aware of Canada responding to our tariffs with tariffs, I don't remember these export tariffs from Canada that instigated a response from us. The tariffs I'm aware of are in response to us using tariffs against them.\n\n\n> The vast majority of part time workers are 25 and older. \n\nI'm not sure how this proves that the majority of part time workers need to be full time?

Trump has openly disliked their distain for military spending and support. \n\nPre-trump, during the NAFTA era Canada had 300% tariffs on dairy products over the quota amount. That is the operational base that they are increasing as a retaliatory tariff increase.  There were very high tariffs on poultry products, eggs, US car imports, and wheat and barley. In addition to that they had restrictions on Wine imports, subsidies in softwood lumber, and restrictions in sugar product imports. \n\nTrump does not feel this is fair at all, hence the tariffs imposed.",

If we do not buy their surplus who does, because their own economies are not buying it. \n\n2.  Prices rise before wages. You are forgetting the compounding effects of keeping currency in the United States. More workers getting higher wages will spend more money in the United States buying more US manufactured goods. The cycle just accelerates from there. \n\n3. While unemployment is low, the amount of Americans not seeking employment is very high. Increasing blue-collar jobs that pay better than entry level positions would pull them back into the market. This would also help by reducing the draw on entitlements. \n\n4. Is it efficient? This is a good question actually. I would say the simplest answer is no. But maybe having such limited internal production is a net negative overall. Covid showed us how we are too open to supply shocks. It also showed us how a lot of our medical manufacturing is actually done by a potential adversary (china). Those are two huge risks that we should mitigate. Also look at the rise of deaths of despair and the collapse of the middle class. We should onshore more industrial base to grow the middle class again.",

The US quota is generous, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been exceeded.  So Canada has a particular goal, which is antithetical to free trade, but they have agreements with other countries that let it work.\n\nWhat Trump is doing historically doesn\u2019t work unless it is a large economy against a small one. Colombia rolled over quickly because of the disproportionate size of the economies. Trump has now imposed tariffs on a collection of economies that at least equal the US economy. Unless Trump removes tariffs, every new tariff will out the US further into the smaller economy bucket, which means he increases the US\u2019s disadvantage. So Canada\u2019s limited scheme protects a particular industry. Trump\u2019s blanket tariffs without any sort of countervailing support will harm people.

I would never expect there to be zero of anything. There will always be drugs.  Always be murders and violence.  It just is.  The goal should be doing everything we can to reduce it. Yes.  But zero? That's unattainable, everyone knows that so it seems disingenuous to say \"if they can't get to zero in a few weeks we need to punish them\". That to me is setting a goal to fail.

At the time, the Trump administration claimed that its corporate tax cuts would increase the average household income in the United States by $4,000. But two years later, there is little indication that the tax cut is even beginning to trickle down in the ways its proponents claimed.\n\n\nThe Trump administration claimed its corporate tax cuts would translate into a $4,000 raise for the average household\nIn selling the large corporate tax cut to Congress and a skeptical American public, the Trump administration claimed that corporate tax cuts would ultimately translate into higher wages for workers. The tax cuts would trickle down to workers through a multistep process. First, slashing the corporate tax rate would increase corporations\u2019 after-tax returns on investment, inducing them to massively boost spending on investments such as factories, equipment, and research and development. This investment boom would give the average worker more and better capital to work with, substantially increasing the overall productivity of U.S. workers. In other words, they would be able to produce more goods and services with every hour worked. And finally, U.S. workers would capture the benefits of their increased productivity by successfully bargaining for higher wages.\n\n\nAccording to President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), this process would \u201cin the medium term boost the average U.S. household income annually in current dollars by at least $4,000, conservatively.\u201d CEA\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d estimate of the average household\u2019s raise was $9,000. Then-CEA Chairman Kevin Hassett claimed that it would take \u201cthree to five years\u201d for these massive trickle-down effects to materialize. A number of critics noted that the Trump administration\u2019s claims were unlikely to pan out, in part because they hinged on the same supply-side economics that decades of tax cuts for the wealthy have consistently discredited.\n\n\nThese critics emphasized a number of flaws with the CEA\u2019s theory of the case. First, corporations were holding large amounts of cash. Second, they were able to access capital very cheaply with interest rates at historic lows for almost a decade. Third, the effective tax rates on U.S. corporate investment, especially debt-financed investment, were already quite low, indicating that the cost of capital\u2014let alone the portion attributable to taxes\u2014was hardly holding back corporate investment. The critics noted that greater corporate market power meant that corporate profits consisted largely of economic rents, not marginal returns on investment. Therefore, a new corporate tax cut would, even if effective, likely be passed onto shareholders rather than being reinvested by the firms receiving the tax cut. Critics emphasized further that even if the tax cuts sparked an investment boom that increased productivity, it would be far from clear whether workers would be able to capture the gains, given the power imbalances between U.S. workers and employers.\n\n\nThe promised boom in business investment never happened\nIn the year following the tax cut, business investment increased\u2014but not by nearly as much as the tax cut proponents\u2019 predictions would have implied. Furthermore, a study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that the relatively healthy business investment in 2018 was driven by strong aggregate demand in the economy\u2014not the supply-side factors that tax cut proponents used to justify the tax cut. In other words, the increase in business investment from the relatively weak 2015-2016 period seems like another example of an economic indicator returning to more-normal levels.\n\n\nWorse, business investment has slowed more recently. The most recent data show that private nonresidential investment actually declined in the second quarter of 2019, contributing to an overall slowdown in growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell pointed to the \u201ccontinued softness\u201d expected in business investment and declining output in manufacturing sector as reasons for the Fed\u2019s recent rate cut.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-corporate-tax-cut-not-trickling/\n\n\nEdit: cleaned up the article",
