How come?\n\nWas The Wall always a literal, physical wall, or was it more a set of ideas and policies that he's now implementing in different ways?\n\nWas it simply a bad idea?\n\nIs illegal crossings at the Mexican border better managed by stricter policies than a physical wall?\n\nDo you want him focus on the Wall again?",

I think it is a good idea to have a physical barrier with Mexico, but that physical barrier needs to be monitored.\n\nA combination of a physical barrier and a ruthless response to illegal entries will deter a lot of people. Removing birthright citizenship is actually what I would rather have than a physical wall.",

If I understand the interplay between \u00a7807 of the bill and the existing version of 8 USC \u00a71324(a) correctly, it would create a fine of $1,000-25,000 per unverified employee.\n\nThere would also be another $2,500-5,000 for each unauthorized worker for a first violation, increasing to $5,000-10,000 for a second violation and $10,000-25,000 for a third or subsequent violation, and debarment from federal contracts and grants for repeat offenders.

There are four major deserts on the border between the Pacific Ocean and west Texas.\n\nExtreme temperatures, limited water, and easy surveillance from the air. It's not a place that untrained people can just go wander 20 miles into the wilderness, walk across the border, and wander 20 miles back to civilization.\n\nRoads are absolutely critical to smuggler routes - whether they're desert trails or paved, coyotes need to be able to drive migrants most of the way, and the more time spent driving desert trails, the better the chance they'll be spotted by air patrols. So they need to get on highways as quickly as possible - hide among regular traffic, get to a city, and disperse into the rest of the population.\n\nThis is why the wall doesn't cover - and doesn't *need* to cover - the full 1,954 miles of border. Air patrol and natural terrain is more than enough for remote areas.",
