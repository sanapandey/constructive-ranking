            "body": "Art can have many purposes, so this first question is, I think, a little silly.  For some people, art is a career path.  For others, it is something that they enjoy.  For still more, it is a way of making a statement.  There's just too many types of art for me to say one particular purpose behind it.\n\nArt does not have any inherent value, in my opinion.  That doesn't mean it is inherently worthless, but rather, something extremely well-done is going to be more valuable, to the average onlooker, than what Little Jimmy drew at kindergarten today.  But I'm sure his parents will still enjoy it.\n\nThis third question gets tricky, and I'm not sure how to approach it, truthfully.  There is practical art and impractical art.  For example, cooking is an art form.  I do not mind tax dollars being used to employ chefs and cooks to cater functions and the like, and I understand the importance of having food available to the POTUS and other lawmakers.  If the Mint decides to issue a new coin/bill with additional features, artists will have to be called upon to design the images.  Heck, every time a new government site pops up, photographers and graphic artists are employed.\n\nI also don't mind \"beautification\" projects, or functional ones.  I have issues with what I call art for art's sake in the form of monuments and the like, just because it's a ton of money that sits in one place, but that is more of a me thing.  I also have problems with art that is meant to be divisive or insulting.\n\nSo, I guess basically, my answer to all three questions is \"It depends.\"  Sorry if that's not much help.",

It is to entertain, to communicate ideas and build cultural standing around those ideas, to study the human condition, a form of self expression, and any number of a thousand other things.\n\n>Does art have inherent value?\n\nArt and what it allows is one of the fundamental things that makes us human, so I would say it has about as much inherent value as anything.\n\n>Should tax payers fund art projects?\n\nOccasionally, but mostly no.",

He then continued to push the boundaries of what was art with \u201cfountain\u201d which was a urinal on its side with the name R. Mutt on it. What Duchamp did at the time was pushed the boundaries and blur the lines between \u201caesthetic art\u201d and every day objects. Asking us to find beauty in every day objects, the artistry in manufacturing and challenging our ideas of what is art. But also he did it first and was popular. \n\nEvery artist after him says that says \u201cI could have just put a urinal on a pedestal and called it art!\u201d Well, you didn\u2019t so you don\u2019t get the credit. Every artist or critic who says \u201cI could have duct tapped a banana to a wall and called it art\u201d, you didn\u2019t, and you didn\u2019t get the press/popular support. Additionally any attempt to recreate that piece is just derivative and unoriginal. \n\nThink of a Meme like Bad-Luck-Bryan, he\u2019s not the first bad school photo, he won\u2019t be the last, but he was the first to become meme\u2019s to express bad luck, and it continues to be used because it was first and popular. \n\nSo, does it make sense then why something like a duct taped banana would be considered art? Does it make sense that being first, and being original are important to art?",

But, it also serves to keep kids off the streets and gives them an outlet. As a practical measure art serves to teach kids how to analyze abstractly and can also teach them about performing in front of audiences. As adults art brings us together for common purposes and serves to give us a way to escape reality for a time. In recent memory, there was a Guillero del Torro exhibit at LACMA that had Stephen Gammell art which was awesome, I go to pop culture conventions all the time (yay SDCC '25), and participated in 6 choirs (3 of which were competition) in high school. Gave me some of my closest friends and dearest memories.\n\n>>Should tax payers fund art projects?\n\nI'm okay with it, to a point. I don't think funding drag operas in Timbucktoo, or wherever, is a reasonable appropriation of our tax dollars, but funding after-school programs here? I'm good with that. Giving grants to original high school or college plays? Grants for school bands and choirs to travel for competitions? That's awesome, especially for low income areas where those kids might not otherwise be able to do that.",

Personally, I think if the part is not specific as to what a person in a role should look like/be, then I think it should be based on talent and ability. However, I'll give a recent example, in the Beetlejuice traveling show Barbara was played by a very talented African American lady. Here is the problem, the part is specific for a Caucasian couple. Even in one of the songs they refer to the Maitlands as, \n\n\"Listen up, I'm not gonna lie\n\nRight now, you couldn't frighten a fly\n\nOr scare a seagull off of a fry\n\nYou ever stop to ask yourselves \"why?\"\n\n\n\nBoth of you are super polite\n\nMiddle class, suburban, and white\n\nWell, all of that is finished tonight\n\nExcept for the white part\n\nObviously\"\n\nNow, casting for the Beetlejuice character is completely open, same with almost every other role,  but for certain roles they are designed for a specific demographic to fill. Unfortunately, some art is discriminatory because of the intent behind the art. I think the intent behind DEI of encouraging underrepresented demographics to compete is fantastic, I think in implementation it ends up being discriminatory. Do I think a theater company should be excluded from grants because they engage in underrepresented areas? Absolutely not, I think art is a wonderful outlet. Are there some areas where there are not enough people to fill the demographics required? Yes, so maybe there should be a thought about changing the play. But, there is art that is maleable to diverse demographics. If you take Les Mis to New Mexico, you will probably have a majority of Hispanic persons auditioning. Now, technically, France in the 19th century was probably majority white. But, there is nothing that specifically restricts the casting. So do blind casting. This is a perfect world in my opinion, blind casting for most parts. Being in choir for so long, I have met talented people from all backgrounds. Going back to Beetlejuice (sorry, love that play), Kelvin Moon Loh from Kuala Lumpur played Otho.  He was fantastic! But watch a video of him trying to do the Beetleuice voice, he can't do it (to be fair, not a lot of people can).  Sorry, I know this is long winded and I'm all over the place. But the arts is a passion of mine, and I don't want ANYONE to be discriminated against. But if I, as a white woman, auditioned for Dorothy in the Wiz, I would not be cast. The character specifically calls for African Americans. So no matter how talented I am, no matter how well I sing the songs, I will never be cast as Dorothy in the Wiz, Nabulungi in Book of Mormon, or Sarah in Ragtime. And that's okay, that is what the art calls for, that is what helps make the art applicable to it's message. It looses meaning when you change some details.",

How do you feel about large public art pieces like the Washington monument or Lincoln memorial or various memorials to our Veterans? Many Trump supporters were upset when public art pieces/statues celebrating confederate soldiers were removed- did you agree with them?",

You can correct me on that if I'm wrong, but I think that's pretty close to accurate. I don't think those statues should have been removed, but rather included in a larger historical context.\n\nAs for the the national monuments, well, those are national monuments. They are titanic and amazing, but I don't think they are there for the artistic value, whether inherent or ascribed.",
