Particularly as they are made to feel unwelcome in educational institutions.\n\nBut is this an example of 'free speech for me but not for thee' from Trumps camp. Or is their something more going on here that a puff piece from Variety isn't getting into?\n\nhttps://variety.com/2025/film/news/julianne-moore-donald-trump-bans-book-freckleface-strawberry-1236310153/\n\n",

I believe, just like I did ten years ago, that the federal government should not be making these decisions.  \n\nDo you not see any problem -- as a conservative -- with this being a federal (and not just federal -- specifically done by executive order!) mandate?  How does this make sense given the push to eliminate the Department of Education?  I thought that the whole point was to return control of what our children learn to us.  Why are these decisions not ok coming from a federal agency, but ok specifically from the Presidency?\n\nI'll ask you the same thing I'm asking everyone else -- and no one is answering.  If the Democrats win in 2028, and the new President mandates by executive order \"Because of the separation of Church and State and because children should not be exposed to religious ideas, I am ordering that all schools receiving any federal funding must remove all books that mention Christianity or religion in any form, or lose their funding?\n\nTo be clear, I would strenuously oppose a Democrat president ordering such a thing.  However, if Trump gets away with this, the Democrats will one day have that power.   Does that not worry you even a little bit?",

Suddenly, an official steps into the \r\nmiddle of the track and tells the runners that obstacles will be placed in each \r\nperson's lane.\r\n\"Okay,\" you think, \"that's kind of exciting.\" A crew of people come out with the \r\nobstacles.\r\nAs you look around, you notice that the obstacles being placed in the other \r\nrunners' lanes look different than yours. You see high fences, large pools, mud, \r\nand barbed wire. In your lane, you see a row of hurdles that you've been taught \r\neasily to leap over. The other runners look confused. You are confused. How is it \r\npossible that your race will be so easy and their race will be so hard?\" \"This belief came from many places, \r\nincluding inaccurate descriptions of Africans and African culture from people who \r\nhad traveled to the continent. And it came from a desire by White people to build \r\nwealth by using the free labor that enslaved people provided.\r\n\u2026The actions that the people who founded this country took and the laws that \r\nthey created deeply hurt people who were not White\" \"White privilege still exists today. It's easy to spot when you know some of the \r\ndisparities in this country. \r\n\u2026These kinds of differences give White people more power and more White \r\nprivilege.\r\n\u2026Even though laws in our nation aren't overtly discriminatory, life is still no fair \r\nfor BIPOC. Many laws are written with White privilege\" \"DON'T BE COLOR-BLIND: Telling yourself or other people that you \"don't see \r\ncolor\" isn't true and isn't fair. \r\n\u2026When you see color, you see more of what makes that person who they are.\"\n\n\"How can I be an ally\" - Also by Kelisa Wing (will just direct quote this one as well)  \"For example, if White students can get a great education, justice means that Black students should assume they can get one too. When Black students don't have the same educational opportunities as White students, that is racial injustice. Another example involves criminal behavior. Someone who commits a crime should be punished. But it is unjust if, for the same crime, a White person is not punished while a Black person is. \"\n\"An ally can be someone who belongs to a group that is oppressing another group, but the ally stands with those who are being oppressed in order to get justice.\"",

I should have written a disclaimer explaining the concept for those who are unfamiliar with it like non-native english speakers.\n\nThe exact definition per Oxford Dictionary is:\n\"exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally.\"\n\nSo when I say \"the mass majority of trump critics spent the last 4 years insisting that Biden was one of the greatest presidents of all time and continue to insist that his administration was perfectly fine.\" I'm not literally saying that a poll was taken on each biden supporters opinion on him with all of them saying he's the greatest president of all time, that would be silly.\n\nI'm just pointing out the fact that democrats continued to support  Biden for 4 years and have argued away his many faults and errors, at least until it became impossible to do so any longer and they tossed him aside. \n\nHere's a youtube video explaining the concept. You can even sing along to it if you'd like, that way you can learn about the term while having fun all at the same time!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuzWLDWm6Zs",

We should ban all guns according to that logic. Truth is that I've mentioned it isnt the guns that should be banned it should be indication that we need to find reason kids see a gun as a solution to a problem (mainly bullying). My theory is it's pov shooting games allowing kids to see gun as solution to problem and bullying getting ignored by administration in schools. Why i say that? Because guns were always common in rural areas before these games were available but kids didn't tote them to school.\n\nBan guns and kids will start toting knives (and have been but it's limited nature of danger vs gun obviously) which means problem solved right if it doesn't make the news \ud83d\ude09 nope",

Making it formal would actually make the issue *better* for us, because in contexts like this, we'd be able to say \"we make curriculum decisions and choices about what to include in libraries and so do you\". As opposed to a more complicated argument about how personnel is policy, the education system should in fact be accountable to voters, etc. while allowing you guys to tactically pose as free speech warriors.\n\nThere is an asymmetry here though: liberals don't have to pass laws because they make up the personnel in the first place. Therefore, they get to look all magnanimous by criticizing things like this, while at the same time knowing that if *they* want to exclude a book, they can just...not buy it, not put it on the shelf, not make it part of the curriculum, etc. Whereas the right, due to not having the personnel advantage, can *only* exert control politically.\n\nThe fear of the other side doesn't do anything in that context, because the worst case scenario is just...how things were prior to us doing anything. Things like this have *zero* downside. Risk: things are exactly as bad as they are now. Reward: they are better. It's an easy choice!",
