Like with most machines things often go wrong (systems fail).  That's why we're there. Most of the time the system failures are minor...but they still require attention (can't ignore an ECAM message and just go trucking along)\n\nYou're right - human error is the cause of the vast number of crashes.  But if you take the human out of the flight deck those numbers change drastically.  The reason that the majority of crashes aren't caused by aircraft system failures is that we're there to manage the failures when the systems break down.\n\nTake amateur GA pilots out of the mix and all those \"human error\" crashes are drastically reduced.  Historically - sure.  The industry has a lot of fatal crashes - but those are mostly historical.  Hell even the recent crash in DCA apparently wasn't the aircrew's fault.  The pilots in that blackhawk appear to be the culprits.\n\nHaving two people in the flight deck isn't \"because of irrationality\" or \"safety theatre\".  Aside from the fact that one of the two pilots could be incapacitated (unlikely - but it does happen) people rarely have \"perfect\" flights.  So that's why there are two pairs of eyes, two minds, etc. working together to make good decisions (and catch each other's or the controllers mistakes) or - god forbid - manage a real life emergency (one pilot flies and talks to ATC while the other runs checklists).\n\nOut of curiosity - since you said you're a commercial pilot - what kind of flying do you do? Do you earn your living flying?",

I was speaking in general, meaning Part 91. Certainly, your airline will have its own FAA approved operating agreement. For those of you reading that do not understand what we are talking about, each carrier operating under CFR parts 121 or 135 make an agreement with the FAA as to their own rules. So the rules for Southwest Airlines will be different than the rules for Delta, for example.\n\n>What law? I'd love for you to point out any rule or regulation that states that.

For example there is ILS CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III. Depending on several factors, you may be able to use CAT I and CAT II under 200 feet, but some visibility must be maintained.  CAT III requires no visibility and is essentially autoland. But CATIII requires very specific ground and aircraft resources.\n\nThe SOPs you talk about, at least in the US, are dictated by an operating agreement between the airline and the FAA. These are under 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135. So the operating agreement for Southwest could be different than the operating agreement for KLM or Lufthansa. The agreements are extremely detailed and are actually \"laws\" in the sense that if you break them, you are in trouble with FAA, not just your company. They are not voluntary.\n\n>In my understanding, the purpose of the autopilot is more to reduce pilot workloads during non-critical phases of flight in addition to enabling precision approaches. Is this incorrect?\n\nWhile true, the fact is that autopilot flies to a much higher degree of precision than human pilots are capable of. Which is why all of the 121 and 135 agreements I ever flew under required autopilot whenever possible.",

Hell you could have 10 autopilot systems (instead of the 2 we have) but if another aircraft system fails that renders the autopilot unable to do its job then you have 10 inop AP systems.\n\nIt's been long time since I flew the CRJ but I had a stab trim runaway (once - it was one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me).  I had to hand fly the rest of the flight.  As I recall AP was unavailable.  And honestly you wouldn't want the AP on with a control surface malfunction.  That's a good way to kill everyone onboard (and for a bonus possibly some innocent people on the ground).\n\n\"I never said \"cannot fly\". I am saying that your operating agreement under Part 121 or 135 likely does not allow you to hand fly aircraft after takeoff or far under DH.\"\n\nWhich company has, in their manuals or hell - anything in writing - that \"does not allow you to hand fly aircraft after takeoff or far under DH.\"\n\nI also didn't say the autopilot was \"useless\" - it just doesn't generally handle wind gusts nearly as well as an even semi competent human pilot.  When I flew the CRJ700/900 we didn't have autothrottles so those were all on the pilot.  Hell half the time when you'd kick off the autopilot on the ILS most of the \"bumps\" would go away.\n\nThe airbus seems to handle gusts somewhat better than the CRJ and the mini groundspeed function of the autothrust does a \\*better\\* (but not great) job in gusty conditions.  But the engine spooling still lags.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the CAT III wind limitations (not just x-wind and tailwind but headwind limits as well).  Hell half of my flights in the summer would have to be canceled if we had to rely on autoland.\n\n\"Reasonable. I am not sure you are either. At least not a commercial pilot. You seem to have a complete lack of knowledge regarding operating agreements with the FAA.\"\n\nI'll tell you what - I don't care whether you believe I'm a pilot or not.  I don't have any reason to lie about it.  And if you got really bored you could dig into my post history - it's a hell of a longer than yours.\n\nBut hell - I'll give you that one.  I'm not management and I don't work in the chief pilot's office.  I'm just a dumb, barely literate line pilot.  I don't make up my own checklists or policies.  They tell me \"you do it this way\" and I do it.  They sign the checks and I do what I'm told (as long as safety isn't compromised).\n\nWe'll let the people on here make up their own minds.  I'm sure there are some other people who've gone through even minimal flight training on here who can make the determination themselves.",

I'll do you one better and say that CFIT is greater than 75% of crashes.  I'm almost positive, given the video that just came out of Toronto (I used to fly a CRJ and I flew into Toronto constantly) that whoever was flying got on the backside of the power curve, sank, didn't add power, and hell it didn't even look like they tried to flare.  They beat that runway like it owed them money.\n\nBut the \\*reason\\* that the vast majority of crashes are pilot error?  Because when a system goes sideways there's a pilot there to correct for it.\n\nI had a stab trim runaway on a CRJ 700.  I had to wipe the sweat off my palms a bunch of times before we landed but I dealt with it.  Without a pilot at the controls hand flying and adjusting for a failed control surface - how well is an autopilot going to do?\n\nAutopilot is a tool and it does a great job under the right conditions (which admittedly are most flights) - but systems fail that render the autopilot unable to safely control the aircraft.\n\nYou are right though - I know enough about aircraft systems and failures that I'd be terrified to get on a fully automated aircraft with a human pilot at the controls to address critical system failures.\n\nBut you're right - it might be cheaper.  As long as fatal crashes don't scare the flying public into staying off aircraft it's probably cheaper to pay insurance claims to the families of the dead passengers than it is to pay for 2 pilots on every 121 flight.",

The other guys is adamant that we're ready for it now.  So I'll say two things about that:\n\n1. I don't think he's correct (at all). I've seen way too many system/mechanical failures in my time flying passengers that would have ended tragically without human pilots at the controls.  But instead of a crash - I had sweaty palms and the passengers deplaned none-the-wiser.  That's how it's supposed to be.\n2. Even if the tech currently exists - it's going to be cutting edge.  Airlines aren't just going to replace every plane they have with untested systems.  Everything in aviation takes a long time - and that's how you want it.  The adage is that the FARs (federal aviation regulations) are written in blood.  Look at the collision between the CRJ and blackhawk at DCA.  People have been complaining about those helicopter routes for a long time.  But they only started to make changes there after a catastrophe.\n\nAnyway so even if we do currently possess the tech (I don't believe we do to a level that's failsafe) airlines won't do it for a long time.\n\nAt the end of the day I think (for even current cutting edge tech) there are just too many variables to turn it all over to a machine.  Think of what Sully did landing on the Hudson - there's no way any technology we have could have done that without being specifically programmed for it (I'll be honest - I like to think I'm really good at my job but...damn that guy nailed it and I'm in awe of him dead sticking that airbus onto the Hudson).\n\nThere are also places in our checklist where it says something like \"if this...then do this.  If that...then do this other thing\".\n\nDo we have perceptible smoke? What does it smell like? Where is it coming from? These are things that automation can't (as of yet) do with any degree of precision.  At the end of the day not everything is a mathematical equation - and pilot are there (primarily) for when things don't go right.\n\nI think that's awesome you grew up around aviation.  I didn't (my dad was a math professor - oddly I think it skips a generation because math isn't one of my strengths) and I'm jealous of that.  I hope you have a lot of happy memories flying with your dad! I'd love to take my daughter up...but my wife is terrified of GA.  I made the mistake (when we were dating) of bringing her along on a flight from LA to Vegas in the middle of the summer.  I'm sure you can imagine that it was slightly bumpy.  Plus she sees all the GA crashes and doesn't want me or our daughter anywhere near a small plane.\n\nI guess that's good though...she's not in a rush to cash in on my life insurance.

Without pilots at the controls of crippled aircraft the numbers would be a lot different.  Hell - I haven't had a very \"exciting\" career and I can think of at least three instances where, if there hadn't been a pilot (i.e. me and the other pilot) at the controls the plane probably would have ended up in the dirt.\n\n\"I am arguing like a physicist. Everyone else here arguing is simply based on feelings.\"\n\nSo you understand the physics of flight but you clearly don't understand the mechanical operation of an aircraft.  You're arguing for a third autopilot - but there are plenty of system failures that render \\*all\\* AP systems INOP (whether you have 2 or 10 it doesn't matter - none of them will work).\n\nBut I'll give you this:\n\n\"Unfortunately, we have tons of training, emergency checklists, but human pilots think they can \"out smart\" all of it all the way to the crash site.\"\n\nYou're not wrong about that.  Intentional non-compliance to SOPs (or standardization of deviation as we like to call it) is a real problem.  Hell people can have the FAA sitting on the jumpseat and they're still engaging in casual conversation in sterile.  And I've flown with people (at every airline when I was a FO) who wanted to do things their own way.\n\nDeviation from checklist discipline and SOP is a huge problem - but it's not as big of a problem as turning over everything to a computer.\n\nYou and I both know we're headed there (eventually) - but the tech isn't there yet.  It's not reliable enough (yet) to stick 150+ people in a fully automated metal tube and launch them into the elements.",

If a car has a system failure it can pull over and the occupant can get out. And if it crashes? A few people die. Not hundreds.\n\nAgreed. However, your whole argument is based on ground communication and/or autopilot failing, but you sidestep everything I say about redundant systems. As if there can only be 1 autopilot in the aircraft.\n\n>I'll repeat this until I'm blue in the face - the reason that's correct is because when there's a critical system failure (not just a caution but a warning) there's a pilot to fly the plane and talk to ATC and another pilot who manages the emergency.\n\n>We do get paid a lot - and the reason is that when systems fail we're trained to deal with an emergency and get the plane on the ground. Without pilots at the controls of crippled aircraft the numbers would be a lot different. Hell - I haven't had a very \"exciting\" career and I can think of at least three instances where, if there hadn't been a pilot (i.e. me and the other pilot) at the controls the plane probably would have ended up in the dirt.\n\nApparently that training has reached a plateau, and has so for 30 years. The obvious conclusion to anyone with a math based training is to reduce human error. This could be done with redundant systems (including autopilot).\n\nListen, I do not think that you are an idiot. I went through the same training you did, I have to do the same training every few months as you likely do, but lets face it, we live in a world where machines can simply do better than we can. If that feels insulting to you, I do not know what to tell you.\n\n>So you understand the physics of flight but you clearly don't understand the mechanical operation of an aircraft. You're arguing for a third autopilot - but there are plenty of system failures that render \\*all\\* AP systems INOP (whether you have 2 or 10 it doesn't matter - none of them will work).\n\nWhich is why I said redundancy for all systems when possible. This is why we have 2 engines instead of one, and the one engine must maintain a certain altitude. Sure, the second engine can go out and we are a flying coke machine, and you will not be able to save the crash, and it will be evaluated as mechanical error (unless the pilot did something to the 2nd engine, which is more likely), but what is the probability of that happening? All of this is built in to the safety equation.\n\n>Deviation from checklist discipline and SOP is a huge problem - but it's not as big of a problem as turning over everything to a computer.\n\nI agree it is a huge problem, but disagree that automated systems would be better and you are providing no evidence to support your claim.\n\n>You and I both know we're headed there (eventually) - but the tech isn't there yet. It's not reliable enough (yet) to stick 150+ people in a fully automated metal tube and launch them into the elements.\n\nI feel extremely confident that it is. However, you are correct, until public perception and those in the industry accept that it is, it is a dead issue.\n\nI feel very good about this being a good ending point to our discussion. I apologize for my snarky-ness, and feel that if that was not a in a political sub we would have had a much more friendly discussion where at the end we disagree as to the timeline, but ultimately, I agree, this is where we are headed.",

However you can have \\*other\\* systems fail that render every autopilot INOP.  3 systems?  Hell 10 systems? It doesn't matter.  With certain system failures (outside of the autopilot) no autopilot will work.  So if you have one of those system failures and the AP becomes unavailable - without a pilot at the controls you've got a very expensive lawn dart.\n\n\"I feel very good about this being a good ending point to our discussion.

In general when politics are involved people tend to get their hackles up.  But this is also (for obvious reasons) very near and dear to me.  The safety of my passengers and crew is the most important thing to me - by a wide margin.  The bean counters want to try and push automation that isn't ready for prime time to save money.\n\nIt's not just the elimination of my job that bothers me (although I'm a human being and I care deeply about my career) - but it's the callous disregard for human life in the attempt to save money that really gets to me. Mark my words - fully autonomous aircraft \\*will\\* crash at a greater rate than aircraft with human pilots.  Like I said - I've had 3 flights (that I can think of off the top of my head) that likely would have led to fatalities without humans at the controls.  Instead we landed and the passengers had no idea (just the way it should be).\n\nWe'll be fully automated someday.  But the tech isn't there yet.  The good news is we probably won't have to wait \\*too\\* long to find out which one of us is right.  They're definitely going to allow fully autonomous aircraft flying cargo way before passengers.\n\nSo when they allow that I'll think back to this exchange and watch the results with extreme interest.",

It's about the qualified candidates that were not hired creating a shortage that did not need to be. \n\n>I mean, most presidents don't fire this much of the government with this little oversight.\n\nI am sick of that term oversight. Either the president is in charge of executive or he is not. Congress cannot be in charge of the executive. It is prohibited by the separation of powers in the constitution. By the same token the courts cannot be in charge of the executive. The only constitutional oversight of the president is removal, election, or limited terms. That is it. The courts can intervene on actions of the executive branch outside of the executive branch but that is all.  The congress can pass laws or remove laws but that is all.",

Why should use of helcopter microphone block ability to hear incoming audio?  Bad design.\n\n\"Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night when the pilot was being tested on the use of night vision goggles and flying by instruments. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight\"\n\nAgain sounds crazy - surely there are better/safer ways to train military helicopter pilots on use of instrument only flights without endangering commercial flights.\n\n\"At one point during the flight before the collision the helicopter pilot being tested called out that the Black Hawk was at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot said the helicopter was at 400 feet, Homendy said.\"\n\nArticle speculates that this might be a bad/misleading altimeter reading.\n\n\"Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert that the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the plane in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approved the request\"\n\nDoesn't sound like good decision by controllers in hindsight.

Bureaucracy and bloat are a natural emerging quality of any complex organization. It's not a matter of IF it exists, it's a matter of how much. And there is plenty of evidence to support it. It's just a matter of whether or not you want to see it. It seems that with democrats, if they don't like the messenger, they deny the message, no matter how obvious and true it is. And the more obviously-true things they deny, the more that reasonable people will walk away form the party, which is what happened during the 4 years under Biden.",
