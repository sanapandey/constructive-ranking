    "selftext": "Is there any consensus in the Trump world on this as a step towards getting big money out of politics? Or is the big money enabled by Citizen's United seen as a necessary evil to further the Trump agenda?\n\nThis isn't to take a swipe at Musk or be contentious, I think we can objectively say big money, billionaires and their associated corporations influence all sides of the political spectrum (some sources below). Though I am left leaning and often vote Democrat, I am particularly displeased with **both parties' inability** to tackle big money in politics. But I am curious and want to hear from Trump supporters on this issue. I could be completely wrong, but to me part of the appeal of Trump is the promises to 'drain the swamp' and stop corruption, and I imagine that must in part mean getting big money out of politics, but I am curious to hear from you all.\n\n**For Reader's Information/Context:**\n\nCitizens United v. FEC (2010) was a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled political spending by corporations and unions is a form of protected free speech under the First Amendment, allowing them to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns. The common complaint is that it allows unlimited corporate and union spending in elections, giving wealthy entities disproportionate influence over politics and undermining democratic accountability. Overturning Citizens United would require either a U.S. Supreme Court reversal or a constitutional amendment to impose limits on corporate and union political spending.\n\n**More sources on big money's impact and Citizen's United:**\n\n# 1. Gilens & Page (2014) \u2013 \u201cTesting Theories of American Politics\u201d\n\n* **Authors**: **Martin Gilens** (Princeton) & **Benjamin Page** (Northwestern)\n* **Published in**: *Perspectives on Politics (American Political Science Association)*\n* **Key Findings**:\n   * **Economic elites and business interest groups have a significant influence on U.S. policy**, while **average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little to no independent impact**.\n   * Public policy is **strongly aligned with the preferences of the wealthiest Americans**, even when those preferences conflict with the majority of citizens.\n   * Coined the term **\u201cOligarchy Hypothesis\u201d**, suggesting the U.S. functions more as an **economic elite-driven oligarchy** rather than a democracy.\n\n# 2. OpenSecrets (Center for Responsive Politics) Reports\n\n* **Organization**: **OpenSecrets** (formerly Center for Responsive Politics)\n* **Key Findings**:\n   * In **2020**, the total cost of federal elections **exceeded $14 billion**, **more than double** the cost of the 2016 election.\n   * **Corporate PACs, billionaires, and dark money groups** dominate campaign financing.\n   * **Lobbying expenditures** have consistently exceeded **$3 billion per year** since 2008.\n   * Industries like **pharmaceuticals, Wall Street, and Big Tech** routinely outspend public interest groups to shape legislation.\n\n# 3. FEC Data & Supreme Court Decisions (Citizens United v. FEC, 2010)\n\n* **The 2010 Citizens United ruling** removed restrictions on independent political spending by corporations and unions.\n* This led to the rise of **Super PACs and \u201cdark money\u201d groups**, which spend **billions** to influence elections.\n* Federal Election Commission (FEC) data shows that **corporate and billionaire-funded Super PACs have become the dominant force in U.S. elections**.\n\n# 4. Hacker & Pierson (2010) \u2013 \u201cWinner-Take-All Politics\u201d\n\n* **Authors**: **Jacob Hacker** (Yale) & **Paul Pierson** (UC Berkeley)\n* **Key Findings**:\n   * Political inequality has **accelerated due to rising campaign costs** and increasing reliance on wealthy donors.\n   * **Lobbying by major industries (finance, healthcare, tech, and energy) has directly shaped policy outcomes** in their favor.\n   * **Tax policies, deregulation, and financial sector reforms** have disproportionately benefited the ultra-wealthy due to **policy capture**.\n\n# 5. Princeton Study on Wealth and Political Influence (2018)\n\n* **Authors**: **Martin Gilens** (Princeton) & **Benjamin Page** (Northwestern) (Follow-up to their 2014 study)\n* **Key Findings**:\n   * **Top 1% of income earners** have significantly more influence over **legislative and executive policy decisions** than the bottom 90%.\n   * **Political donations from the wealthiest Americans correlate highly with legislative action**, particularly in **deregulation, tax cuts, and corporate protections**.",

Do you think there could ever be a bi-partisan political alliance on specific issues like the one you just raised (challenging Big Pharma for example)? What could that look like? I acknowledge this pipe dream stuff, but I as someone more to the left and is consistently disappointed with Democrats, do support many policies that I feel like working class Trump supporters would support. Could there be a world where these working class or otherwise supportive members of the Republican and Democratic party put pressure on their respective parties to address some of the systemic issues screwing normal people in a bi-partisan way?",

Obviously, we shouldn\u2019t hate rich people for the fact they are rich, but it\u2019s true that they have in fact captured the government to screw the working class as you acknowledge. \n\nIt\u2019s so laughable that neo-cons like Ben Shapiro make the innovation argument as if your primary motive of wanting to cure cancer is to make money. What the fuck happened to the hippocratic oath? You are suppose to become a doctor to save lives not to just make money. \n\nAs someone who is an independent and lean right it\u2019s so frustrating to be fighting against the woke right who are white nationalist and the establishment right like Ben Shapiro. I think a world where the working class unite is possible, but it requires moving across the table and voting for populist candidates. Similar to how some Bernie Sanders voter voted for Trump, as a Trump voter I would vote for someone like Bernie even if they are too far left for me. \n\nI would vote for Josh Hawley, JD Vance, Ro Khanna, Vivek, Sean\u2019O Brian and Jon Stewart (if they decide to run). We need to mass deport establishment politicians out of government and fake populists like AOC (she\u2019s a coward who has the audacity to call Nancy Pelosi mama bear).",

Free people can spend their money where they want to.\u00a0Elected officials want the people's money. They will always find a way to get it. In many cases, the money never changes hands.\u00a0It is a quid pro quo transaction. I'll help you with your oil drilling rights problem if you will build a new wing on the Children\u2019s\u00a0hospital in my district with my name on it. Surely, you are not going to pass a law limiting the wealthy spending money on things that benefit local communities.\n\nThe only way to get money out of politics is to make politics unattractive to money. If government does not have the power to grant me a tax break then I have no reason to lobby for one. If government cannot impose regulations that limit my competition then I have no reason to lobby for one. If government does not have the power to give me an exception or a benefit then I do not have a reason to lobby for one. If government cannot afford to fight a war in a foreign land to protect my interests \u00a0then I have no reason to lobby for them to. This is the very reason that our founders tried to limit the roles and the means of the federal government. It is the unconstitutional powers that this money you hate in politics is paying for. You cannot live in a free country and limit the way people spend their money. You can still live in a free country and stop granting unlimited abusable powers to government.",
