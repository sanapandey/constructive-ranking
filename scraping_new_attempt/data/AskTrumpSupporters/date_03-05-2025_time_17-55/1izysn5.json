He's also appointed Tulsi Gabbard to his cabinet who is famously anti-war and American military adventurism.\n\nHe also withdrew troops from Syria after defeating ISIS rather than leave troops in the middle east, breaking with the longstanding American tradition of never-ending middle east deployment.\n\nHis Pentagon is also floating a $50 billion budget cut. In fact one of the things Trump has criticized is that the Pentagon got a budget increase post Afghan withdrawal.",
