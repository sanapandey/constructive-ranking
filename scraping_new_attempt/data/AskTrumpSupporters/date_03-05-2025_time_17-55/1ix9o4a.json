[The Hill article](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5161197-us-votes-against-resolution-condemning-russia/). The resolution passed w/ a vote of 93-18 with 65 abstentions.\n\n  \nThe United States voted in opposition along side Russia, Israel, North Korea, Hungary, and 13 other countries. In your opinion do you think this was the proper vote cast & agree like the way this is being handled?\n\nFor additional context, the [US did offer a resolution of its own](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-united-nations-resolutions-5a8af28518c4a81d70613f1e19702ae8) on the Russia/Ukraine war but it didn't receive enough backing in favor of the previously mention resolution.\n\n  \n",

US boots on the ground and NATO membership for Ukraine to guarantee their security. The Russians are pushed out of Ukraine completely. Russia knows that both the US and Europe will never do this.\n2. A negotiated peace based on more or less the current fronts. This might require some horse trading regarding resources, payments, and/or trade deals. Russia clearly has the advantage in this negotiation since they have Ukrainian territory, popular support in Russia, vastly more men to throw into the meat grinder, and nukes. It is possible this negotiation might involve a timeline of a year or less if Ukraine thinks that might get them a more favorable deal.\n3. Ukraine keeps fighting until they eventually run out of men to die.\n\nA negotiated peace will be easier to obtain if you are not assigning blame. Regardless of what anyone thinks about the long history of why this conflict occurred, the pragmatic approach is to simply weigh the consequences of the options as they now exist.",

This is especially the case when the side you want the best for (Ukraine) is being bled out faster than the other side. We have given Ukraine reason to listen to us with years of support. Now we have to give Russia a reason to listen to us in negotiation. And calling them names while we are trying to do that is counterproductive. We already know this and have been condemning them for years. Why do we have to reiterate it now, at this very moment? It just screams of geopolitical sabotage.\n\nReally, does none of this make sense or do you see where I\u2019m coming from?",

That's par for the course over in askconservatives where I contribute regularly; but figured this place would be different since its intentionally reaching for opinions of Trump Supporters and not just generic 'conservatives' so naturally people would be accustomed to seeing opinions with which they disagree. I suppose I guessed wrong. Thanks for the heads up and thanks for the positive support.\n\n> As for a question, what do you think of the value of an international body (UN) imposing soft power pressure through statements like this one?\n\nI don't really think I have a terribly strong opinion on that if only because for an organization built in the aftermath of WWII to solve the problems of the League of Nations that led to war anyway it's done a pretty spectacularly poor job furthering global peace especially when its major members (the P5) have those among them well known for either outright wars of aggression or wars on false pretenses in their past and have been held to basically zero international account.\n\nIt's kinda the equivalent of a guy writing a sternly worded letter to the guy who raped his wife. Maybe there's middle ground between 'call the boys and tell them to bring their guns' and that, but the UN doesn't even go for \"we should call the cops and file charges and put them in jail.\" So it's very hard to take even their soft power seriously.\n\nDon't even get me started on the major issues the UN just completely glosses over, ignores, or spends zero political capital working on. There's been a war between Morocco and 'Western Sahara' for like... 50 years that any organization should theoretically be able to put some meaningful lid on with the might of the *entire world* behind them and... nothing. Still border skirmishes to this day. 50 years?! Come on guys... if nothing else we should be docking the UN's allowance for not cleaning their room for 50 years like this.\n\n>  that kind of international condemnation shapes opinions, perceptions, and decisions.\n\nI do agree with you here; unfortunately the UN has a long history that we've been awoken to recently of not doing a great job shaping opinions in a positive fashion. Lest we all forget UNRWA, but there's lots more besides.\n\nIn the world of 2025 I don't know how much a UN resolution matters... if only because the UN has issued a resolution to condemn Russia for their war of aggression several times now... all to the benefit of fuck all.\n\nThe definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expect a different result, after all.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful comment, I'll be tagging you on my end to know you're a strong good faith interlocutor I can feel comfortable spending time engaging with in the future.",

To say nothing of the fact that they are PROVABLY toothless when it came to actually imposing punishments on us, the US, after our odd foray in the Middle East.\n\nBut if Russia thinks a UN vote is worth something, then it's worth leveraging. That's the point.\n\n> Basically, your answer isn't really relevant to the question asked. If your argument was \"we need to do everything we can to appease the Russians to make a peace deal more likely\" I would strongly disagree, but at least it answers the question and as such wouldn't deserve downvotes.\n\nMy answer is pretty relevant; people asked \"what do you think about the resolution\" and I said \"I think the UN is toothless and garbage, but if it's worth something to Russia to vote their way to get the war ended, then it's a valuable trade.\"\n\nTo think that doesn't respond to the question is patently ridiculous. But if you think your answer quoted here wouldn't deserve downvotes, I'm happy to post that elsewhere and give it a try for you? Want me to keep you updated?",

Should a home owner back down to save life if they are out numbered by invaders if that means they lose their house?\n\nTo frame it in a more real setting.  \nDo you think France and other European countries should have just surrendered their lands to German when threatened and actually invaded? They were out gunned, out manned, and it was a senseless waste of life. They didn't have a right to defend themselves?\n\nDo you feel it would have been a better outcome after the 1940 invasion of France by Germany that they had just allowed the Germans to claim half of their lands to keep the peace? Does appeasement work with bullies?\n\nThe bottom line is, apart from the money (which is all the Maga movement seems to bring up about why they don't want to support Ukraine), why does the US care so much if the Ukrainians are fighting to the death to defend their country from a violent and dangerous neighbor?\n\nThey seemed fine helping the Afghans against an invasion by Russian back forces. They seemed fine helping the Koreans against Russians/Chinese backed forces. They seemed fine with it when the Vietnamese were fighting Russia/China backed forces. They seemed fine backing rebels to fight Castro. They seemed fine with helping the Iraq's Against Saddam. They seemed fine to fight in Libya, Syria, Uganda, Somalia, Yemen and Serbia.\n\nBut suddenly Ukraine is crossing a Rubicon and they need to cede their land to an invading force?\n\nTo put a bottom line to this. Its the Ukrainians right to fight to death if that's what the country wants to do, to survive and defend their land vs foreign invaders. If certain country's don't want to defend what's right, shame on them. But don't take the moral high ground. One side in this conflict caused this invasion, death and destruction.

Yes, people hated the idea of Ukraine joining NATO. Yes, your quotes here prove that this was a concern for decades. But you keep painting this war as one of NATO aggression, ***when NATO was never a part of the discussion when Russia attacked.***\n\nAs I've mentioned in our discussion before, and in another comment here in this post, Russia, the US, and the UK had signed the Budapest Memorandum, which put in place a security assurance that nobody would threaten the territorial integrity of Ukraine if they remove all of their nukes. Russia broke that assurance when they invaded and annexed Crimea, destroying Ukraine's independence and sovereignty in the existing borders. Meaning the US and the UK were obligated to act in assistance and defense of Ukraine against Russia.\n\nRussia's attack against Ukranian independence and sovereignty was unprovoked and unjustified. Ukraine ***DID NOT WANT*** to join NATO, ***not until 2018, four years after Russia had already attacked their independence, destroyed their borders, and annexed Crimea.***\n\nSo I'll ask again; why should Ukraine suffer an invasion from Russia over an action that Ukraine had *already and continuously* ***explicitly*** voted against? Why does Russia get to claim NATO aggression when NATO was ***explicitly*** denied during the annexation of Crimea?\n\nIf my neighbor makes deals and threatens my fence on my left, does that give me the authority to break into the house on my right and claim their backyard as my own? Even when the house on my right had already vocally refused to work with those on the left?",

If Russia doesn't like NATO pushing east, they can stop pushing their neighbors into NATO's arms by being less abusive.

None of this was a secret- the previous CIA director serving under the Biden admin [understood very well that further eastward expansion was a red line for Russia](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html), yet the US kept pressing the issue, perfectly aware that it will provoke a violent reaction from Russia.\n\n>Why does this matter at all? Ukraine said it wasn't happening ...\n\nUkraine declared in its [1990 declaration of Sovereignty](https://static.rada.gov.ua/site/postanova_eng/Declaration_of_State_Sovereignty_of_Ukraine_rev1.htm) that it intends to remain a permanently neutral state that will not be joining any military blocs. Why did it violate its own declaration by [applying for NATO membership in 2008](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/833852.html)? Why should Russia take what Ukraine says seriously?\n\nJames Baker also said that NATO will not be expanding further eastward. Should Gorbachev have trusted him?\n\n>Russia decided to illegally annex territory during a time when that territory was openly neutral.\n\nIt was not openly neutral- on the contrary- the legitimate Ukrainian president was overthrown illegally, and a new, hostile government was installed, with the support of the US, and headed by Yatsenyuk- one of the signatories of Ukraine's application for NATO membership in 2008.\n\nRussia was therefore understandably anxious about the future of its naval base in Sevastopol. Given the lessons learned from the past, why would Russia take any chances? Because Yatsenyuk- the guy who applied for NATO membership years before- said he wasn't looking to join NATO at the time? Why would Russia allow itself to be fooled again? You have yet to address these questions.\n\n>This goes both ways.\u00a0Why should any neighboring country trust that Russia would respect their independence and sovereignty when Russia had time and again broken treaties and acted aggressively?\n\nIt doesn't go both ways because that's not how geopolitics work. You don't trust that your bigger, stronger nuclear neighbor won't act aggressively- you simply don't provoke them and give them a reason to do so. Ukraine did not heed that advice- instead, guided by the West, it acted in a manner that predictably caused Russia to lash out violently.\n\nSo this conflict is not entirely the fault of Russia and Ukraine. In fact, it is mostly the West's fault. We pushed for this, fully aware of the consequences we'd bring about, and it's about time we start taking responsibility for all the devastation our actions have caused.",

Do you believe that a criminal who has gone through prison is still a criminal deserving of punishment because they once committed a crime? Is it right and justifiable for a husband to beat his wife because he previously threatened to do so if she called the cops?\n\nBecause that's all this is. In the years between the Budapest Memorandum and the annexation of Crimea, politicians were afraid that Russia would act beligerently if sovereign nations made the decision to join NATO. Politicians were kowtowing to Russia because Russia had threatened violence if NATO became involved. The metaphorical husband demanded obedience and threatened abuse if the wife called the cops, and the neighbors chose to appease the husband rather than help the wife.\n\nThen, in 2010 and through to 2014, even after the revolution, Ukraine chose to remain neutral, abandoning its goal of joining NATO. The metaphorical wife hung up the phone and announced that she had not called the cops, they would not be coming.\n\nYet Russia attacked anyway. You claim that because NATO was on the table before, the wife had once held the phone, Russia is justified in enacting violence and aggression, even with that phone currently placed sqaurely on the table. You suggest that a criminal's past actions irrevocably paint him as a continuous threat to be put down on a whim, no matter how peaceful he has been up to this moment. Invading a country that, for years, has been making no hostile moves makes Russia the aggressor.\n\nRussia can not use NATO as a justification for invasion and annexation because Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership, full stop. Any rumors, gut feelings, or past grievances beyond that are nothing more than shitty excuses to veil Russia's true intentions and ulterior motives.\n\nSo why does Russia's threats of violence permit it to escalate to true violence when *a sovereign nation* finally makes the decision to join a defensive pact *after* borders were crossed and territory was stolen?",

Again- just because you're saying this doesn't make it reality. The US also \"abandoned\" its goal of further NATO eastward expansion in 1990.\n\nThe established pattern had Ukraine going back-and-forth on this issue several times in its history depending on where the loyalties of the elected government lied. A foreign power supported the illegal ousting of Ukraine's democratically elected, Russia-friendly president, and handpicked the pro-NATO head of the new government, whose first legislative action was hostile to the ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. This was a blatant act of interference in the sphere of influence of another nuclear power.\n\nSo what I'm saying is this- we had fooled the Russians that we won't be expanding our military alliance further to the east. We knew NATO membership for Ukraine was a red line for Russia, and we expected that Russia will react violently to it. All of this was\u00a0*predictable*. Yet, not only did we refuse to ease Russia's anxieties by providing hard guarantees of no further eastward expansion of NATO, we were\u00a0*actively pushing*\u00a0for it, and then supported a coup in 2014. We knew what the consequences of our actions would be and didn't care.\n\nWe are hugely responsible for the mess we created, but note that I'm not talking about morality here at all- I'm simply saying that as a matter of fact, we played a huge role in the chain of events that led to this war. Whether you ascribe moral wrongdoing to our actions is entirely up to you. I personally do.\n\nYou can argue that the invasion was morally unjustified, but geopolitics don't deal with morality. States exist within an anarchical system- no one \"permits\" Russia to escalate to violence. We can choose to give Russia reasons to escalate to violence, or we can choose not to.

In any case, specific counterpoints are better argumentation than ad hominem.\n\n>Could it be because Russia acts like Russia does?\n\nThis is better. What are you referring to?\n\n>In that case are we really at fault for allowing countries to exercise their free will?\n\nThis is addressed in my comment, but the Cuban missile crisis fell under our Monroe Doctrine, where we demand total security in our hemisphere. Russia has the same right to security at least on their border where most historical attacks on Russia come from. Ukraine was fine with that but the US kept pushing, Joe Biden and John McCain constantly 5000 miles away in eurobumblefuck Ukraine to stir the pot.",

There has been a marked shift since 2016 in pro-Russia talking points on the right. \n\n>Those who are rabid anti-Russian, who seem to support this wholesale slaughter of people really sicken me.\n\nRight, I'm sure you feel the exact same way with Israel and Palestine. It's hilarious that you have Trump as your party leader and are pretending to lord over others morally. \n\n>The USSR is gone.\n\nGone, but not forgotten. Putin himself wrote an essay about how his only goal before dying is to restore Russia to USSR land borders. \n\nDo you really believe appeasing expansionists will stop their expansionism?",
