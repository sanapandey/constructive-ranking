Quit drinking at 42 and started buying them for milestones. 100 days, 200 days, 300 days, a year. Tomorrow is 500 days, and being Fat Tuesday,  and me living in the Deep South, tomorrow is a holiday and off work. I\u2019m going apeshit at the Lego store! My wife says 500 dollar budget, but I\u2019m not even looking at prices lol! \n\nThere are so many things that we all can afford that would have been a problem to pay for back in the drinking days. I paid 462 dollars Friday to have two of my dogs teeth taken out and a cleaning. He is getting older and had some loose teeth. I was spending at least 10k a year on alcohol, so now a random unexpected 2-300 dollar expense is no big deal. It\u2019s great!",

I bought a little backpacking guitar, nothing fancy, with 2-3 weeks worth of my booze budget. I cried when I got it because he was right. I had to see what that money looked like as anything else besides booze / bills. I\u2019ve had some great times with that guitar and I still have it. It\u2019s smaller than 3/4 normal size and it\u2019s tuned to an open chord in my daughter\u2019s room. She\u2019s almost 6 and she likes that it\u2019s smaller than my other guitars. I can\u2019t help but get emotional when I hear her strumming and singing her silly little songs. That money would have been turned to piss a long time ago. It\u2019s given me more than any round of drinks or party weekend. \n\nI think about stuff like that and it\u2019s easier for me to pull the trigger on experiences that can build some memories because I\u2019ll fucking remember them. I think the hardest part about all of it was actually sitting down to do the math. The amount of time/ money / energy I spent planning, drinking, hiding the effects, disposing of the evidence and being laid up hungover is astronomical. It made me see that I have time to work on sobriety because I always found time/ money to drink. Keep going and definitely treat yo, self!",

Long as I keep that perspective too I don't feel I am missing out on anything (at least not anything I would want!)",

I think this is the first time I have tried quitting without being impatient to get to day 30, 100 etc as fast as possible, but simply enjoyed being sober instead. Even early on sober feels so much better than intoxicated. \n\nThere are off course some cravings now and then, but being clear about what I want (go on that vacation, get that dog, wake up well rested, deliver great quality at work etc. ) helps a lot. Alcohol only seems precious to me when I loose hope. Maybe that's why the first 3-4 days were tough? I am surprised how much more positive and happy I am after just a week. Sure, I know alcohol is a depressant, but the extent of how it's messing up the mind is scary. I guess I have finally accepted that I can choose to be a happy person with a good life, or I can choose to be that depressed and scared person with a gloomy outlook on everything... I don't want that first glass so much, but if I have it I want 10. \n\nIWNDWYT",
