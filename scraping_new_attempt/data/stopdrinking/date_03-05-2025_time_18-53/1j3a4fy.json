    "selftext": "I\u2019ve (38m) been drinking since about 21 but really started to hit it around COVID. Since then I often drink 2 bottles of wine a night and flick in a couple of shots while I\u2019m at it. I\u2019ve had a number of times reducing but it\u2019s never quite taken hold.\nOne of the problems is I\u2019m actually not a problematic drunk, worst I do is fall asleep on the couch, which my wife hates (fair enough).\nWe recently welcomed our first son into the world and I love him and am a great dad, but still struggling with curbing drinking.\n\nA few things;\n\n- I\u2019m scared about stopping because it\u2019s the only way I get any feeling of contentment or escape from my own brain (I\u2019ve had depression and anxiety my whole adult life - WELL predating my drinking - and it\u2019s such a mercy to have relief from my own existence at the end of the night. I also have been in therapy for a very long time, which is vital, but also I\u2019m still left with being in my own skin)\n\n- My closest friendships, of which I have few, are not necessarily drinking orientated, but definitely based around going to the pub and letting our hair down. Having said that, one of my few positive \u201cme\u201d times is having a pint at the pub with myself and watching some sport. I need that alone and escape time to survive (PS. going for a run or a walk does nothing).\n\n- as said above, I\u2019m a good drunk, in fact I\u2019m actually better with some drinks (and I\u2019ve been told this), I\u2019m not angry or abusive or sabotaging, but I know I\u2019m doing poorly to my health\n\n- My wife knows how much I drink, is supportive of me and wildly patient because she knows that berating me will make it worse, but she worries about my health (as do I) and wants me to be able to come to terms with my demons (as do I)\n\n- I love drinking. I have wild anxiety, feel so uncomfortable being me, am so bored so much of the time, hate my job, love the people in my life; if drinking didn\u2019t harm me physically, it would help me massively\n\n- the brass taxes: most bad things in life previously can be attributed somewhat to alcohol. Even though that\u2019s very different now, and I\u2019m currently leaning on a crutch of past trauma, it\u2019s the only crutch I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m asking for, except maybe some words of solidarity from people who are/have been in the same situation.

Outside influence only served to add frustration to the experience because the underlying catalyst was not coming from me. Take from that what you will.\n\nI know you said that you\u2019ve had depression and anxiety before you were drinking. Consider the fact that developmentally, you were in a completely different stage of life before you started drinking than you are now.\n\nI have seen a lot of people on here say that they were in the same boat, but didn\u2019t realize until after quitting, how much drinking was contributing to their depression and anxiety. While drinking didn\u2019t 100% cause their depression and anxiety, it was definitely adding to it. I know that was the case for me in terms of anxiety. I still deal with anxiety on a daily basis, but it is so so so so so much more manageable now.\n\nEveryone is different and YMMV, but I\u2019d be willing to bet that if you were to quit drinking, you would see an improvement in these areas after giving your body some time to re-regulate. Maybe not a total fix, but improvement nonetheless.",

No one would ever think my drinking was problematic because I\u2019m in control, happy, a great parent, etc. or at least I thought that until my 9 year old son told me he wanted me to stop drinking wine and was worried I would die. As your kid gets older they won\u2019t want to see you passed out on the couch and there will be times you will have to be sober to be there for them. It\u2019s heartbreaking to have a kid make you pinky promise to not drink. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but is sounds like you already know stopping is the right thing to do for your family.",

If you can stop using it, your brain will find pleasure in other ways. \n\nI'd also suggest checking in with the spouse. Ask her honestly if you are as present as she would like. I wonder if she is dealing with being a single mom every time you start drinking. I hope I'm wrong, but it's worth asking. I'm a mother, and I know I would not trust someone who has been drinking to take care of my baby at all. Just dozing off in the wrong position can suffocate a baby, and waking up at night is exhausting even when completely sober.",

Especially terrified of \"never again\" and that's why \"one day at a time\" is such common advice that's given. It sounds like you have a bunch of good reasons to make this positive change for yourself. I will tell you this as someone who also has an unhealthy relationship to alcohol. I gave it way more perceived value than it actually held in reality. That unhealthy relationship warped every view that I held that had anything to do with booze. In my mind, it was my hobby, my security blanket, my emotional support animal, my best friend and my armor. At one time, I fucking loved drinking but it just didn't love me back. I considered myself a \"fun drunk\" but underneath that I was also a fairly unhappy person. It's just bad medicine.",

            "body": "The thought that I\u2019m better with alcohol really stuck with me for a while too because I\u2019ve been told the same, and in social situations once I had that first drink or two I\u2019d be a better conversationalist, able to approach people more, able to ask them questions and be interested, all that. I recently had the realization that framing those abilities as given to me by alcohol has affected the way I see myself, my self worth and  my confidence in myself. \n\nAs a whole I already am noticing that I have so much more confidence in myself now that I\u2019ve had even just a few experiences showing up, not drinking, and still showing up as that person. Or showing up as a person that I like and still enjoying myself, even if I am a little more reserved. Or even if it takes a little more pushing myself to get myself over to talk to someone and engage - I pat myself on the back more after I walk away because I feel like I\u2019m *actually* getting better at it and not using something as a crutch. \n\nI still have anxiety but for me I can\u2019t speak to it helping - it must have helped at one point for me, but all my memories before quitting involve drinking just making me feel worse and have more anxiety by that point. Personally for me staying sober has drastically and markedly, like stunningly, helped my debilitating anxiety. I have had mental health issues since teenage years and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of the reason I turned to alcohol in the first place so it\u2019s been scary to work through that without alcohol but for me it wasn\u2019t helping anyway anymore so that did make it easier for me. \n\nSimilar feeling for me with hobbies. Sitting and having some wine at a restaurant with a book was one of my absolute favorite me activities. But I\u2019ve seen myself have so much more self confidence just through the simple acts of enjoying my alone time without a drink and find in something else to do. Sometimes it\u2019s old hobbies I haven\u2019t done for a while, sometimes it\u2019s finding something new. It\u2019s been fun and has reminded me how much of a completely rounded and complex person I am meant to be regardless of whether alcohol is involved.",
