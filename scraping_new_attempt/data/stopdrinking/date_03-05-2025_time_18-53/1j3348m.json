    "selftext": "I have an off and on again relationship with alcohol. I never thought my alcohol use was something to worry about until i started working with people with addiction issues. Suddenly, I started hearing these stories that I related to. Or id hear an alcoholic talk about losing everything and how it started for them and I suddenly realized I could be steps away from that too. So to those who sat on the other side, I want to ask a few questions that I\u2019ve considered. First off, In high school I\u2019d be getting drunk with my friends because it felt like that\u2019s what we did. I graduated from high school and the jersey shore era became what we all chased. Go out, get wasted and have stories in 10 years. I messed with drugs but alcohol was always what brought out what I thought were the best parts of me. Then in my late 20s I decided to go back to school. And I stopped drinking completely. I got through my 4 years and in my masters years I picked it up again. I remember the first night I got drunk alone. I had had a very long week and I remember instead of trying to find something to do with friends, I stayed home and drank all night. And I remember thinking, wow I have fun alone. I can escape my thoughts alone and it suddenly felt like, I found something to help me pass the time during what was a very stressful time. Then my parent died and I started drinking a bottle of wine every night. It was a way of dealing with the guilt I felt because my father was sick all through my masters program. And I remember my last semester telling my advisor that I was looking forward to being present again with him. And he very suddenly died during the pandemic. I thought I still had more time. He died my last semester of school. And I lost myself. I was a very polished person at the time. Working multiple jobs, waking up at 5am to run every morning, and after his death I sort of resented that person who never made time for anything but school and working out. 6 years later and I have a good job, I\u2019m married, and I still feel empty. I decided to slow down on drinking. But even now, when I go out with friends, I\u2019m the one who is downing every drink. And I tell myself, I\u2019m paying my bills and making it to work. How bad is it?\n\nBut now, I drink and I feel empty. About a year ago, I stopped drinking for 6 months because I found myself drinking alone in my car before my wife got home. I recognized that was a dangerous game. But I\u2019m back at it. And I keep thinking about something someone told me at AA\u2026.. \n\nYou\u2019re in control, until you\u2019re not. \n\nI still fantasize my relationship with alcohol.  \n\nSo, did it really happen in that way? Do you wake up one day and can\u2019t control it? Addiction does run in my family. So there\u2019s that.\nBut how do you exist in social settings without alcohol? Another thing I noticed was, the anxiety and awkwardness that happens when I don\u2019t have drink in my hand. How does one find something else in those settings? I don\u2019t want to shut myself out of a social life like I did when I went back to school but, I\u2019m cranky when I\u2019m out and everyone else around me is drinking. And I can\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that alcohol just makes existing manageable.  When I\u2019m drinking I give into all my wants. I eat like crap. I smoke a pack in a matter of hours or day. My sleep is off. I don\u2019t work out.\n\n\nAnd still I want the alcohol.",

            "body": "First of all, I am so sorry to hear about the passing of your family member. I think you hit some really great points here. Everyone who we can look at and say \u201cthey are worse off\u201d started somewhere too.. it\u2019s weird how slow of a progression alcohol is. A counselor once told me \u201ci bet you never thought 10 years ago you would drink like you do now, and you don\u2019t want to be saying that again in 10 years\u201d. It\u2019s not a overnight thing. It happens in a slow, creepy, compounding way, which is why you can look back one day and think \u201chow the heck did i get here\u201d but like you said.. still want the alcohol. It\u2019s one insane substance.",
