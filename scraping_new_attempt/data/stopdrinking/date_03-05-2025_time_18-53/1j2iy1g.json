    "selftext": "It is time to reconfigure my life.  I set the sober  clock at midnight on March 2, 2025 and I will not drink today.  I want to be fit and healthy and present and mindful.  I have taken a month and a bit off the past couple years in February but as soon as I am agitated around day 40 I go back to my daily beers.  I am a very social drinker and do have friendships around alcohol that I will now have to navigate.  I miss the old me.  I miss being in control.  I miss not being agitated over every single thing around me.  Let's goooo!  The healing begins today.",
