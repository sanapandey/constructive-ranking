    "selftext": "I've been lurking and reading a lot in this group. I'm using Lent (well day before)bad my jumping off point. \n\nI'm 42 years old and my early 20s are a literal blur. I was able to move to a more casual drinking level for years. Then last summer, I started drinking nightly. I was only 1 a night. But as it goes 1 became 2...2 became 3... Etc. i really started going strong in November after the US election results (I won't go into detail there but suffice to say I wasn't happy).  Things came to a head on NYE. Everyone went to bed and I got completely wasted to blackout drunk stage. \n\nSince then I've cut back some but it's creeping back up and I'm starting to make dumb decisions (dunk texting ugh). It's like I'm two different people.  gotta be honest, I'm scared. Dunno why exactly...\n\nTruth be told I'm very lonely at night. Kids and wife are in bed and it's just me. I'm not talking about crazy hours either... it's like 9, 10, 11pm. All my friends are doing the same so it feels very isolated. \n\nAnyway...it's Day One. Each journey starts with a single step, right? ",

As a part of the process you\u2019re likely to work on being comfortable in your own skin and thus less susceptible to loneliness.   It may require outside help of one sort or another",

I had cut back the nightly drinking last year when I gave being sober a go, but have watched the drinking slowly increase and now getting back to a point I don\u2019t want to be. It might be simpler just to stay off completely. I hope this lasts more than 40 days for me, and you too!",
