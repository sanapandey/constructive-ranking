    "selftext": "I decided this weekend that I don\u2019t need alcohol. I don\u2019t need it to be fun, likeable, less socially awkward, or make friends. I don\u2019t need it to make others feel better about themselves when they\u2019re already drinking, and I don\u2019t need it to celebrate someone or something. Although my issue with alcohol is mainly restricted to the odd weekend out, I never know how to say NO. I don\u2019t know when to stop drinking when I\u2019m already out with friends, and I struggle to say no to a drink in the first place. This bleeds into other poor decisions with my judgment already cloudy, I will agree to things I normally wouldn\u2019t, and there\u2019s large chunks of the night I genuinely can never piece back together. My last straw really happened when I gave myself acute alcohol-induced gastritis, where I spent two days running to the toilet every 10 minutes to throw up stomach acid, unable to eat or drink anything. \n\nI grew up with alcoholic parents, and I just turned 24. I see no benefit in drinking anymore. Why am I willingly poisoning my body? I wake up in my clothes, contacts still in, makeup still on, it\u2019s disgusting. Albeit I don\u2019t drink like this often, once a week or once every other week becoming blackout drunk is STILL a problem. I have started taking the gym more seriously and I\u2019m studying for the LSAT, I can\u2019t wait to leave alcohol behind. I can\u2019t wait to spend my weekends with a clear mind and no nausea. Regardless of what my friends say to me, I need to stay strong and think bigger than temporary enjoyment. ",
