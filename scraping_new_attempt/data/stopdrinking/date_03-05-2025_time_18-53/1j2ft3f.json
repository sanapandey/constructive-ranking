I'm 8 months and 1 week sober today, yes I'm doing the work, eating, exercising, therapy etc. BUT if it wasn't for everyone here I wouldn't have anywhere to go to keep me motivated. \n\nSo THANK YOU for sharing your stories and your continued support. \n\nI raise my cup of tea to all of you, here's to another day of sobriety IWNDWYT.\n\n",

Congratulations on over 8 months of sobriety!\n\nI agree that having the chance to read other peoples stories who are and were in the same situation as you is so motivating. It really helps to keep you on track!\n\nKeep up all of your great efforts! You can do this!",
