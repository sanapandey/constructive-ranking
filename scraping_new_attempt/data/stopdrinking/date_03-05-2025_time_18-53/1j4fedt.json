    "selftext": "I really wanted to have a drink yesterday, but I didn't because of the things this community keeps reminding me about. So in case there is someone like me, here is what I remembered and told myself last night:\n\n\\- It won't be one drink. I won't stop at one.\n\n\\- I don't want to be hung over and tired for work tomorrow.\n\n\\- I don't want the anxiety I get the net day.\n\n\\- I don't want the guilt of having failed at this (again).\n\n\\- I want to get up early and work out.\n\n\\- I want to get some chores done.\n\n\\- I want to be proud of myself for making this good decision. \n\nThank you all for posting your wins, your losses, your questions, and your musings. You helped me yesterday. IWNDWYT.",
