    "selftext": "Hi, new here \ud83d\udc4b I started reading these stories on Google this morning to feel less alone, then decided to join the community. Making a post to hold myself accountable.This is my day one, and I admit that a single day seems impossible right now.\n\nMy dad died of alcoholism and my mom drank a lot when i was growing up. I am steadily becoming her younger self and that haunts me. This consistent drinking is killing me. I don't know who I am anymore. I still have a glimmer of hope I'll find myself, but I've tried getting sober so many times, it's embarrassing. Top that, 90% of my marriage is blown up from drinking. My husband got sober recently but as for me? I keep failing. I'm not even sure if my marriage is salvagable at this moment. I've said and done terrible things while drunk. I'm so ashamed of whoever I become when I drink. I know it's not me but again, I'm incredibly lost.\nI've created my own hell not dealing with my inability to stay sober, to stay focused at work, and to stay present in general. I have a kid ffs and that's the absolute reason I have to stop drinking. I want to break the generational curses and I haven't been doing that. I've just piled trauma on top of trauma with no resolution  to any of it. I have officially hit my own rock bottom.\n\nThanks for being a landing spot for these huge emotions while I try to sort out my life. Love the IWNDWYT and have it written on a sticky note already.",

Thank you for sharing this and I hope you know you have more than enough power to break the generational curse. It might not seem like it now. But it\u2019s true. Keep sharing and reading here! Today is a good day to be sober.\u00a0",

Those emotions are bringing mine out so heck, I\u2019ll share :)\n\nMy dad is a recovering alcoholic, most of my childhood was spent in Ala-non, my mother chose sobriety but yet died in a fatal car accident. All that childhood trauma haunts me. My behavior as an adult, heck! my personality sometimes just wrecks me. Heck I just got out of a design meeting and already my inner critic is beating me up!\u00a0\n\nAll in all, I am who I am. Acceptance is part of recovery. Learning to sit with myself, my feelings and thought process. Realizing my frame of reference may not be someone else\u2019s, therefore accept.\n\nMy inner critic is a mean monster. I fed that monster with alcohol for way too long.\n\nOne day, I decided I matter. 5 months later, that monster is still present but I\u2019m pulling it apart, piece by piece. I do matter and alcohol is not going to create an illusion for me anymore.\u00a0\n\nIWNDWYT forge ahead one day at a time.\u00a0",

Mine is a deliberately mean and nasty person who never shows me grace. I am on the road to deciding I matter and not just because I'm a parent, wife, or daughter but because I'm me. We both deserve happiness without alcohol. Congratulations on 5 months. That is incredible!",
