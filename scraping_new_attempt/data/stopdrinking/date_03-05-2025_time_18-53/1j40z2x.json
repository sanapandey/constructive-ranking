    "selftext": "Hi, lovely people, I know: no politics on here, and I appreciate it. \n\nI just wanted to know how you all deal with the current affairs regarding power politics, threat of war and the state of the world in general. Sitting in central EU, the daily news makes me more afraid of our future, every day. \n\nI fear that some day I will go ahead and try to numb myself for a couple of hours with alcohol, even though I fully understand that this will not solve anything, but make my anxiety even more intense for a few days. \n\nI frankly don\u2019t know what to expect from this post other than the recommendation to stop watching the news for a while and avoid doomscrolling. It\u2019s hard for me to do this, I feel the need to stay informed. \n\nMaybe I just want the reassurance that I am not alone. \nHowever, no matter what, IWNDWYT. ",

These are fun and interactive and fulfill my device usage without delivering awful brain rotting content. Reddit is the only social media I use and I have been skipping the front page in favor of reading directly on subs. I understand feeling compelled to keep up to date but the reality is if something major does happens we cannot avoid it even if we tried! The news will find you, maybe 5 hours later but you\u2019ll still hear it or come across it somewhere. So I don\u2019t actively seek out that type of info because I know it\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s a major lesson in anxiety and what I\u2019m allowing in my brain space. It isn\u2019t easy and I hope I\u2019m not downplaying any of it, good luck friend",

            "body": "Same. As well as being an alcoholic I was a massive news junkie. Politics was my primary focus. Reading every possible article on everything political every night while drinking was causing me major anxiety and rage. I honestly thought that I needed to know every single word or misdeed in that world so I could be well \u201cinformed\u201d. Then I stopped drinking and I started coming here. In the morning, afternoon and evening I came here instead. \nIt felt like a safe place to be and kind of insulated me against everything that was happening outside of this space. So now with what little time I have left in the evening I scan the headlines and I get the gist of it without going down the rabbit hole. I can\u2019t change what\u2019s happening outside  so I\u2019ve come to accept that and am concentrating on the things that I can change. I can change what I consume. I can change myself. I can\u2019t change the world. \nIWNDWYT",

I think the problem with just scanning the headlines, at least for me, is that they are often clickbaity, sensational and scaremongering. I used to read a lot of background info to reassure myself that \u201cit really isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d\nWell, with he current state of affairs, this doesn\u2019t work any more. \nGood idea to spend more online time on this wholesome and friendly sub, instead.",

I know and appreciate the rule here but frankly this is a big factor and it has to be affecting a lot of people's substance use. 11/5 - 1/20 almost drove me straight into the ground with my drinking. I was at my worst ever. I was living in a drunk or hungover groundhog day, a miserable shell of a life. I began getting panic attacks when I combined news updates + hangover brain, and I don't normally even get panic attacks. I chose to stop digging and put down the shovel 2 weeks after 1/20 and came straight here. Today I have 30 days. I now have a strict zero politics policy. I changed all my social media usage. I blocked everything, I changed my algorithms, I removed apps from my phone. I told all my friends do not update me on politics. It's helping. My mood feels much more steady. Of course I am still very worried but not debilitated. The truth of the serenity prayer is my higher power. If I can't control it I need to not think about it. It does me no good. IWNDWYT",
