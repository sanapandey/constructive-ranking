    "selftext": "Hey guys,  \n\nLong time lurker and I don\u2019t know where else to go. \n\nI\u2019ve lost a marriage to alcoholism/bipolar disorder. That is several years past now and I got a new roommate in my apt to save some money with questionable work stuff going on.  He moved in mid January and we discussed it being 3-6 Months or so. Seemed like a great dude (still believe he is as far as kind soul).\n\nHe stayed in his room a lot at first and I confronted him to be clear that he wasn\u2019t doing hard drugs or anything which he assured me hasn\u2019t.   Fast forward and he is in fact suffering from crippling alcoholism.  The room I\u2019m renting him is now trashed.  Can smell it from outside the room.  \n\nI feel so dumb for not doing more diligence as I always just assume the best in everyone.  All this to say, has anyone been in something similar? I noticed stuff missing from the fridge so I eventually had to check the room when he went out and I think he\u2019s flirting with OD.  Just cans and bottles scattered everywhere in the room, every surface, under the bed.  Left over food etc\u2026 Clearly suffering from depression and heavy alcoholism.  I confronted him this morning and said he has to move, 30 days was our agreement.  Offered to help clean the room myself but he doesn\u2019t want that and just full of apology.  Apologies however are not what I\u2019m interested in, I just want a clean room and him to move on.  \n\nHaving dealt with my ex wife and all\nof the unpredictably that came with serious depression and booze I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has any advice or similar situation with a roommate.  He\u2019s not on anything more than casual roommate agreement, not the actual leases. This has effectively triggered ptsd in me and I want it to be done asap.\n\nThanks for listening and apologies if that was rambling.  \n\n",
