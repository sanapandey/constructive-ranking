Are you still drinkin?\" \n\nThree years was my peak. So far. Ran into ex-FIL in the grocery store. He was an athlete back in the day. After 5 minutes of small talk, he gave me another 5 minutes of praise. At that point, I was down 55 lbs and yoked. It didn't hurt that a hot woman walked by, smiled, and said hello in the middle of it all. \n\nAbout the same time, I met up with work peeps for an after work thing. It'd be almost 2 years since a lot of us saw each other in person. That 1 guy who already had a few asked me if I work out during business calls. He kept calling me Lincoln Hawk. \n\nYeah, so for me, I was a fat bum while drinking. Stopped drinking and devoted all that anger to lifting and eating clean. I also put in the time and effort to get results. It doesn't happen day 1 or day 50. It takes time. But damn it's worth it. IWNDWYT",
