    "selftext": "I'm scared to talk to my doctor. I am currently prescribed adderall, an ADHD medication. I've hidden my (extremely/daily) heavy drinking from everyone in my life, but I'm very afraid of talking to my doctor because she might discontinue my medication since it's a commonly abused drug. I believe she will be too afraid to continue my prescription because an alcoholic is not a person that's worth the risk of a schedule II drug. \n\nI have been been on it for four years. Originally diagnosed by a psychiatrist. My blood pressure is very high and I'm pretty sure it's because of my very heavy alcohol consumption. But i quite literally cannot live without my rx adderall. I've had to go without it before and to say i was unable to function would be an understatement. I don't know how to tell my doctor that I need help without risking my entire life (not an exaggeration).",
