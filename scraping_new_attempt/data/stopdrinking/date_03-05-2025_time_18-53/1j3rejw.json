    "selftext": "I had been sober for 2 months. I live in a strictly alcohol free house. Yesterday my housemate accidentally bought home a bottle of spirits with a bunch of baking supplies she had left at her mother\u2019s house. \n\nI found it while I was cleaning the kitchen. I don\u2019t know why I drank it. I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t remember pretty much anything about that day. My housemate came home and thought I was just taking a nap. But then she found the empty bottle. \n\nWhen she wasn\u2019t able to wake me she called an ambulance. I must have been in that state so many times previously but I either lived alone or with people who didn\u2019t notice or care. It\u2019s kind of scary to think about. I\u2019m so ashamed and embarrassed but it was a reminder that I still need to be vigilant. I\u2019m going to be stronger next time. ",

Whatever works I support it, but I found myself to be more forgiving when I gave up the idea of a sobriety date.  \n\nNo hate on your lost bc i know some people refuse to drink bc they have x amount of days or years, just my own perspective that worked for me better.  Either way, I will not be drinking today so let\u2019s do that together?!!!",
