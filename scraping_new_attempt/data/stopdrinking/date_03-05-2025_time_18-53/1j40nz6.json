My family is a lot happier with me and me and my woman\u2019s relationship has improved rapidly. She stopped drinking and smoking at the same time as me. We\u2019ve been going to the gym and not taking each others grumpy bad moods too serious when they happen because we know it\u2019s just because this sober thing is new well here\u2019s to Wednesday day 15 halfway through the week and Saturday will be here in no time.
