Obviously I don\u2019t want it to come to that.  \nHow do I create that motivation now ?  Not trying to sound like a db I want to stop and this is my real first time trying. \nThanks and god bless you all . \u2665\ufe0f",

            "body": "I've started and stopped more times than I can count in life. Mid-50s right now. Days 2-3 were always the worst for me. I would always take days off here and there out of guilt, but after a few days, I'd start feeling better and get a case of the fuckits. \n\n  \nI can tell you that I am not even 2 weeks in, yet this time and I am already enjoying the following benefits:\n\n* Waking up guilt free knowing I didn't drink the night before. Very underrated benefit IMO.\n* Speaking of waking up, it took a while but the past 3 nights I have gotten my most restful sleep in literal months. That in itself is huge motivation.\n* Saving money. Through a set of personal tragedies, money has suddenly become much tighter. I figure in 2 weeks I have saved at least $150-$175! And I thought I was a cheap drinker. That helps quite a bit right now.\n* Just feeling less emotional and much more even keeled. I mean, there are a ton of other factors at play, but I KNOW the absence of alcohol has helped with that. \n* Feeling more mental clarity. Performing better at work because of it. \n* This is a biggie for me: I feel a lot better about myself in general. There is a sense of empowerment and accomplishment that you can fight these cravings and be in control of them. :) I don't feel like a drunk. I don't need to be self-conscious of my drinking if I'm not drinking. :)\n\n  \nWhat helped me in the beginning was to frame it like this: Beer isn't going anywhere. It will be there 24/7/365 (for me at least as I live in LV). I should do this long enough to see and enjoy the benefits. I know it's super early for me and I am still hypervigilant, but this has only changed my life for the better these past 2 weeks.\n\nLong post aside: It is 100% worth it.",

The brain and the booze are profoundly powerful liars.\n\nOne thing that might be worth perusing is the various horror stories in here and r/alcoholism.\n\nSearching \u201cruin\u201d \u201chealth\u201d or \u201crock bottom\u201d will generally turn up the documented experiences of a lot of folks that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as you have. It\u2019s also possible from your post that you don\u2019t really fear mistakes or legal/financial/social consequences, given your history so far, in which case the health is key.\n\nPoison is poison.\n\nCongrats on getting going, the first few days and week or two are the hardest. Congrats also on looking ahead and anticipating the temptation to slide etc.\n\nIWNDWYT",
