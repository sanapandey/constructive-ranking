    "selftext": "I\u2019m feeling proud. I\u2019m living a totally different life. I\u2019m less reactive, more empathic, less self-centered, less angry. I\u2019ve changed my life in so many positive ways as a result of letting go of alcohol and weed. My life was out of control and I was putting myself and others in danger. I am growing up. Or at least I can see that I\u2019m the one with work to do - not anyone else.\n\nIm not looking back! Thank you for being a part of my sober journey. I state my intention that I will not drink with you all every morning. This community has supported me and allowed me to grow in my sobriety.\n\nLove to you all!\nIWNDWYT! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\ude77\ud83c\udf05",
