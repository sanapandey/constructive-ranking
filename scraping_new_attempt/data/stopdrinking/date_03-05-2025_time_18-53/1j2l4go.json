I\u2019ve decided to give alcohol and ordering on DoorDash up for lent (even though I am not religious). I just feel like I need a concrete goal?? Like dry January, if that makes sense. Something that\u2019ll allow me to see the light at the end of the tunnel so on days I want to drink, I can just think \u201cyou only have to make it until the end of lent and then you can drink again\u201d. Obviously, I would like for sobriety to stick but I think I just need a start and end date, idk. ",

            "body": "> \"*Did you lose weight fast after stopping drinking?*\"\n\nNo.  I was overweight when I stopped drinking and then gained well over 20-lbs in my first year because I substituted food for alcohol. I had to be okay with that because eating kept me from drinking and drinking was killing me. I would be dead now had I not stopped.\n\nOnce I had a ***solid*** foundation of sobriety (into my second year), I tackled my diet. By my third soberversary I was the smallest and happiest I've ever been in my entire adult life and I've kept it off. I used many of the same tools and discipline I used to get sober but applied them to my eating habits.\n\nIt can be upsetting to feel \"food\" is a bit of a co-addiction, but I had to consider the bigger picture. I tackled one thing at a time but always kept/keep sobriety as my Number One priority.",

I\u2019ve always had the stupid \u201call-or-nothing\u201d mindset that I think a lot of alcoholics have. When I was drinking, this meant I would always drink to excess, and since I was already destroying my body, I may as well eat like shit too. And of course alcohol makes making other bad decisions much easier. \n\nSince I\u2019ve been sober, that (still harmful) mindset has at least helped me to commit completely to eating better. Since I\u2019m not drinking, I may as well not eat like shit either. I still have some nights, particularly weekends, where I replace alcohol with food, but by and large I\u2019m eating much better and losing weight.",

It wasn\u2019t until this time around that it finally clicked for me that being sober isn\u2019t the answer. You\u2019ve got to replace all that time spent drinking, planning to drink, recovering from drinking, with other things like hobbies, reading, walking, exercise, classes. You have to fall back in love with real life. Then you don\u2019t want to drink when you\u2019re bored because you\u2019ll be too busy doing other things or genuinely being able to relax and unwind. It\u2019s sounds crazy, never thought I could be a person to actually relax but holy shit do I love my lazy sober weekends filled with tiny little joys like going on a hike or to a boxing class",

It's a free challenge to join and every day of the 30 days have videos with education, inspiration, answers to questions, a community of people you can connect with and more. Highly recommend the book This Naked Mind as well because it's a straight forward approach to what alcohol does to us when we consume it, and it flipped how I viewed alcohol completely so much so that I didn't want it anymore. \n\nGood luck and congrats on thinking about your relationship with alcohol \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb it's brave and difficult in a culture that falsely glamorizes it, and it's one of the BEST things you'll ever do for yourself",
