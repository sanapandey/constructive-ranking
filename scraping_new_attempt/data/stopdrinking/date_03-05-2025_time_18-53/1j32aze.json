    "selftext": "Hello, fellow Sobernauts!\n\nWelcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober.\n\nI once heard someone say \"getting help helps\" and that resonated with me.\n\nWhen I was deep in my drinking, I tried to hide it from everybody.  There's a lot of complicated thoughts and feelings that went into this behavior, but one that I commonly cited to myself was I knew the people in my life who loved me and cared about me would be worried and would want to help me stop.  And I didn't want to stop.  I wasn't ready.  And I knew that I'd choose alcohol over them and I'd hurt them and our relationship in order to keep drinking.\n\nIn sobriety, I still wrestle with help.  Nowadays I find myself still resisting help because I want the pride of \"handling it myself\" or \"I don't want to bother them with my bullshit\" or \"what if they say no\" or \"what if they think I'm weak\".  It amazes me that I get stuck thinking this way.  When the situation is flipped, I love getting to help those around me.  I like being useful and easing someone's burden.  I don't think they are weak, burdening me, or bringing me bullshit.\n\nLately, I've needed to ask for help.  I have a thyroid issue and I've needed to see a doctor to treat that.  I'm starting therapy back up because I'm overwhelmed.  These are things I can't do myself, but I need help doing because it will help me be a better me and a better me can better help those around me.\n\nSo how about you?  How has your sense about getting help changed in sobriety?",

            "body": "I went to therapy for the first time because I was in my own head and not happy. I knew drinking for 40 years was taking its toll. I was fearful of unlocking this big emotional baggage from my childhood. It went better than I expected. He taught me how my brain was modeled and why I have been running from conflict forever. He explained that the 16 year old me found booze as a relief. I realized how tired I was of lying, hiding, running, and drinking. Getting help made me see how much I\u2019ve lost, but I have time to recover my body, my marriage, and be a great grandparent. Stay well everyone!!",

That led me to some dark places so this year I realized I have to build relationships and networks outside of work.",

Getting help isn't something I have ever found easy, but as time has gone on with this sobriety journey I have become honest with myself I'm starting to feel more comfortable with this rather than constantly in a shame and guilt cycle. Sometimes it naturally slips out (the honesty) with others ,which to me is a sign that I'm more comfortable sharing. I have never found it easy after a traumatic event as a child,even counselling has only on occasion had me actually seeking help: I don't want to ' burden'  others. This time sober has finally given me some inner peace, I'm starting the important stuff now which includes asking for help.\nThis sub has been a great,safe ,place for me to be vulnerable.

It's been a huge step in my life and one that was waiting for me a long time. I feel so much ligther in my spirit, and a kind of peace that I really needed all these years. There are still hardships and I haven't figured it out but it's a life long journey to find new things. I'm grateful for the self awareness in that and that taking the steps to where I want to be is the first step.",

Several months later, I met a lovely woman.\n\nIt takes a village of support to keep me sane most days. I\u2019m going on nine months of sobriety in a week, I\u2019ve worked this program like my life depends on it to get me over the reasons I drink. I have gotten zero people back in my life from the fallout that caused me to quit drinking initially. No old friends, no old community. The fallout was so severe that no one who has heard my amends that I wrote in AA have invited me back into their lives, and most of them have been unwilling to hear what anyways.\n\nI\u2019m extremely grateful for all the new people in my life who have been so supportive of me. I would, quite literally, be dead; if I hadn\u2019t asked for help.",
