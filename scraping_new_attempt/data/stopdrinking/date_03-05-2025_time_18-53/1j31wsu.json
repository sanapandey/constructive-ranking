When I first quit drinking, I gained 20 lbs because I started drinking gourmet soda like it was my job. It filled that void. The cold bottle in my hand, the same motions. I figures \u201cbetter fat than drunk.\u201d And I was right. I eventually switched to sparkling water but those habits are hard to break!  Have a glass of grape juice. Hell, drink it at room temp if that helps. But you got this. IWNDWYT",

            "body": "It\u2019s never just one for me tho. Even on nights I managed to keep it under a normal amount, I\u2019d still think about it. My mind would get loud about when to get another one or calculating how many are left and when I have to wake up in the morning. If I was out with people, I\u2019d think about if anyone notices or  if I have to do anything to hide the effects of the last couple I snuck. My mind was always on the next one even if I tried to sip and take it slow. I\u2019d also make sure to reward myself handsomely in the immediate future for my \u201cdiscipline\u201d and I\u2019d be right back to where I swore I wasn\u2019t going anymore. When I play the tape forward for me, it\u2019s never just one and off to bed. I have plenty of research to tell me where i go and what I\u2019ll do and I know from that extensive research that it\u2019s easier for me to stay sober than it is to get sober.\n\nI still catch myself staring at peoples drinks from time to time or I\u2019ll think about having a drink when I\u2019m just relaxing. I feel like I have a hand on the volume now and I\u2019ve asked myself what I actually like to do for fun and how I like to relax. Connection plays a big role in my sobriety now and I try to not pursue the isolation I kept myself in as a drinker. When I\u2019m connected to others who work on the Sam thing, I feel more connected to myself and I\u2019m able to answer those questions more honestly. It\u2019s a lot more fun with other people too.",
