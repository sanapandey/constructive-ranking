Was about to tell my wife but I came here to tell you folks instead because I know you will understand what that means to me. Maybe I\u2019ll tell her later but she will just nonchalantly say oh that\u2019s great and then change the subject or just go back to what she was doing. And that\u2019s ok. IWNDWYT",
