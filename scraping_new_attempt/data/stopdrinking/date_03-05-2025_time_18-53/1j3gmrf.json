Finally getting over a hump of hitting 6 months and the little voice was creeping in telling me I should since I could clearly \u201chandle\u201d abstaining. I won\u2019t be drinking and all these reminders are daily. Proud of your time keep it up it gets so much better.",

That feeling is so much better than any drink you\u2019ve ever had. \n\nThose grinding gears had years of neglect. A bit of tlc and they run smoother week by week. Too subtle to notice but every now and then you think about it, and the grinding noises are so much quieter than they used to be.",
