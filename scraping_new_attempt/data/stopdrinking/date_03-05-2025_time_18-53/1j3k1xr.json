    "selftext": "I've been drinking almost daily for about a year and a half (maybe more, honestly I dont remember stuff well. I dont drink blackout drunk ever, but I still just lose track of time and forget when things happened). I have a cronic sore throat now, and just feel bad in the mornings. I never used to get hungover, and I dont even remember how long I've been getting hungover. I just dont want to keep doing this to my body. But I dont know how to stop. It's a cycle. I get of work, and i pick up booze. It's just my routine. I dont know how to live my life without substances. Where the hell do I begin?",

            "body": "You took the first step. I, too, lived a life revolving solely around substances. Booze, weed, adderall. I really thought that was the point of life. Work during the day to make money to spend on booze and drugs. I spent most of my 20s that way, thinking I was similar to everyone else, maybe just a bit tougher and more prone to \"go hard\". \n\nLooking back on it now as I close in on 2 years sober, I rarely was enjoying those times. The only part of it I enjoyed was the escape from mundane day to day life. And that, in and of itself, was a problem. If you had asked me a few years ago I would tell you that life is not worth living without alcohol or drugs. And while life isn't the greatest now, I have learned I am capable of a life without those things. You are, too. It may seem like it's not possible now, and I'm just some guy on Reddit telling you it is. But trust me, I was EXACTLY like you. I would drink on work nights just because. Go to work sluggish and with a headache. Feeling terrible. Then would improve just enough to resume the cycle that night again. The worst part is eventually those nights will start to bleed into the mornings, and that's when the hole gets deep. \n\nHang in there, believe in yourself. And most importantly, never, EVER, give up.",

For example if I was in your shoes I would plan a quit date for May 1st and slowly work towards that date. Whatever you do please don't abruptly quit as that can cause you a lot of hell. I witnessed it first hand. I am rooting for you and IWNDWYT",

A couple of months would be too long for me to keep my eyes on the prize.\n\nOf course, you should check with your doc to be sure you\u2019re safe to withdraw at home.",
