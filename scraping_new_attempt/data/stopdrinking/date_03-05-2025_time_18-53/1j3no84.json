    "selftext": "Back again.. Day 1. No victim shit cause I\u2019ve contributed fully to this reality. Lost my relationship once again. Got into a car accident due to my drunken selfishness. Almost lost my job. Got into my first physical altercation..with a family member nonetheless. Spent my whole family trip either black out or filled with hangxiety. Physically and emotionally hurt myself. Left work early/called out. Neglected the needs of my loved ones. Neglected myself. For the love of god, when will i stop?? When do i finally put my foot down and stay sober? How do i do that? Am i truly this weak? Ok..maybe i am a little victimy right now. I\u2019m sad, angry, regretful, and honestly feeling like shit. Just like that instant gratification of alcohol, i wish i could fast forward 10 years and remain sober. Regardless, no matter how hard.. the time will pass. And god willing, I will pull the strength needed out of my belly and try. Because maybe it\u2019ll get better. Cheers to this moment, I will not drink with you. ",

White knuckle through. Glad you are back here . For me this place was the strength and inspiration I needed to go through the first tough days. There\u2019s so much support and love in this place - and no judgement\u2026 all of us have done our fair share of stupid drunk stuff and share the same desire to stop sabotaging our lives with alcohol\u2026. You can do this! We all can! IWNDWYT",
