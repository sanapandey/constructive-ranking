    "selftext": "When I wasn't drinking, I was thinking about drinking. \n\nFor the last year or so, my brain has been obsessed with the booze. How many have I had? How many more can I have? How many did I drink this week? When can I drink again? What will I have to drink next time? How many will I have? \n\nOn and on and on and on and over and over and over and over. \n\nAfter 6 months, the obsession seems to be subsiding. And it feels so great. It's a huge relief, actually. \n\nI'm getting my brain back. And my thoughts back.\n\nI'm so glad I stopped. I want to stay stopped. I want to keep trying. \n\nIWNDWYT!",

I tracked diligently for the most part because I\u2019d been trying to quit or moderate for years. Until I\u2019d get blacked out or super drunk and it would trail into jibberish or random shit I thought of and drunk thoughts. Kinda funny tbh. \n\nGlad to be out of that but still can\u2019t wait for my brain to rewire and stop thinking about it all the time still.\n\nOne thing tracking my drinks diligently tho it did make it easier for me to taper in a legitimate methodology than guesswork\u2026 so there\u2019s that. I def could only accomplish the tracking when I\u2019d reduced my drinking to like 10 or less a day",
