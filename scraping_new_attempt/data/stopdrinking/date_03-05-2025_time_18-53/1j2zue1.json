    "selftext": "Today 7 days clean working on 8. I was walking around my house today just doing random chores thinking to myself 'huh my house is sure cleaner then usual' i never really noticed how many small tasks i never did anymore because i was so hungover or drunk . I also have been working on making myself do things so that i don't just spend all my time thinking about drinking.  Don't get me wrong the first 4 to 5 days awful.. i havent cried that much in a while .... But still, a lot of things like just simple chores or even leaving my house to go get something as simple as milk. I wouldn't do it , I just would go without if i had to. \n\nToday i went to the store, cleaned the house, did the laundry and had an apt for one of my kids at my house and i wasn't scared they would know how fucked i really am. Today is another day that actually feels like i'm getting better and it gives me hope. I dont feel so hopeless today. And thats a fucking win to me \n\n",

Good feeling to see stuff get done.\n\nIWNDWYT",
