First we did a 20 minute  HITT type of workout followed by a recovery meeting. On my way home I thought I have to do something like this. \nI am a Spin Instructor. I brought my idea to the owners of the gym I teach at. One week later SoberCycle was born. I lead a 30 minute spin class the I lead a 60 minute recovery meeting. A topic is discussed about recovery, addiction, trauma anything to do with mental health. It's free for the community and it's every Friday night. Grateful for the owners of the gym holding the space for us. \ud83d\ude4f",

Sometimes I read stories on this sub of people who have been sober for 3, 4, 5, 6 years + and then they drink and find themselves right back into where they left their nightmare. I get scared when I read those stories. Even though right now I feel like I will never drink again, didn't they feel that way too? Anyway, thank you for sharing and  being an inspiration. \ud83e\udd29",

I just remember how bad it was for me to drink. Now I love being present and remembering everything. I always have an exit strategy and have left on many occasions because I was uncomfortable.I know if I start drinking and using again I will lose everything I have worked for. Living life on life's terms can suck but I it's better than drinking or using. What it really comes down to is it's my choice. So far I never want to be in that life again.",
