Or just so anxious,we spent all the time hiding from everyone an always thinking about if we had enough money to go out an if we did, did we then have enough for a drink an a smoke  too. It wasn't a life. We existed. That was all. On Friday we are having a new carpet fitted. Yet again something we would never have bought if we were drinking. Our life is completely different now. Every day I'm glad we gave up. Your life can an will be better the longer you remain sober too. Good luck on your journey. IWNDWYT xx",

Remember these feelings of yours, and honor them.  They may help keep you sober for years to come.  \n\nBut forgive yourself the shame, cause alcohol has taken down the best of us.  It is oh so cunning.   Even though I don't go any more, I recommend AA for those desperate enough to need it in the beginning of sobriety.  You don't EVER have to utter a single word, but it still can help big time.  When they ask \"are there are any newcomers who want to...,\" you don't have to say anything at all! Just sit there if you want... and walk out of the meeting whenever you want, and don't talk to anyone after the meeting if you want! Just get up and leave, and come back if YOU want to. LOTS of newcomers do that. However, if you leave in the middle of the meeting as a brand new newcomer, someone MAY follow you out simply to ask if you are okay. Handle THAT how you want to. Say you're okay, or break into tears, whatever. There are NO requirements for AA EXCEPT \"a desire to stop drinking.\" Period, full stop. But there's magic empathy there. They will feel it for you, even if you never open your mouth to speak ever. You will feel it for them when you hear some stories. Magic, I swear, but only as much as you want, on your terms.  The magic can lift you up.\n\nLove.",

I know I have many regrets, such as being too drunk to drive home on the night my beloved doggo was dying, leaving my daughter to have to navigate that. So many regrets! But I have today, sober and proud.",
