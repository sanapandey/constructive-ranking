    "selftext": "I LOVE the feeling of being drunk. I HATE the feeling of waking up scrambling to put the pieces of the previous night together. I made it 3 days without drinking last week, my longest stint in way too long to remember. \n\nI felt better those days, and hopeful. But also I was counting down to when I would have a \u201dsocially acceptable\u201d excuse to drink next. Well that chance came (more like I SEIZED the opportunity) and now a week later, I have had alcohol every night since. Back at it again. It\u2019s not hard to find reasons to drink. I have become really good at it, to the point that my, at first, occasional use escalated to every evening over the past several years. I saw it happening. The number of days I wouldn\u2019t drink started slowly increasing. And I just kept on. Started with just when hanging out with friends. How did I get here? Why can I not stop thinking about having a glass (or 5 if I\u2019m being honest) of wine tonight after the chaos I don\u2019t remember causing last night? I use it as my \u201ccomfort\u201d but I know what I\u2019m doing to myself and just keep digging the hole. \n\nThanks for getting to the end of my stream of consciousness. Don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for, but this first step of writing it down felt important for me. ",

I had to quit drinking. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve learned to have the feeling of \u2018the glorious second drink\u2019 every day all the time in sobriety!",
