    "selftext": "Has anyone else had their family doctor shame them for being honest about their drinking? \nI haven\u2019t shared this with many people, but I required a medical note for my union a while back to support my leave due to complicated grief. I shared with my GP that my alcohol intake was a little bit more than I was comfortable with since the tragic and unexpected loss of a family member (2-3 glasses of wine a day). \nMy MD told me that I was on a bad path because there are alcoholics in my family (information that I shared with him because I have an alcoholic brother who was harassing me, compounding the grief). \n\nAfter the letter was sent to my union, I found out that he shared with them that I was an alcoholic, unbeknownst to me. \n\nI\u2019m a professional entrusted with minors, who has NEVER drank on the job. And this could have absolutely destroyed my career. Not to mention he didn\u2019t tell me that he thought that I was an alcoholic. The only reason I found out was because my union called to clarify what my treatment was for the alcoholism. \n\nI had bloodwork done and he said that my results were \u2018unremarkable\u2019. Honestly, he seemed surprised and disappointed. \n\nThe way he treated me like a pariah for being honest about my drinking has scared me from being honest with anyone else. I read these other stories of people having doctors who supported them and helped them see a path forwards.\n\nI really wish that\u2019s how I would\u2019ve been treated, rather than someone he saw as disgusting. \n\nIt\u2019s disheartening, and I don\u2019t want to ask anyone else for help now. \n",

I sincerely hope it was a horrible oversight due to an overly busy doc/miscommunication.\n\nPCP and other medical docs seemingly have no or hardly any training in how to talk to people as in mental health counseling skills, or re addiction issues and how people should be approached about substance use, which is so disappointing and frustrating and can really hurt patients, it's awful.\n\nFYI if it helps any I wouldn't read into the word \"unremarkable.\" My docs always use that exact word when lab work is normal and there's nothing out of range or nothing concerningly out of range. I've gotten this word dozens of times, on all sorts of results, and unrelated to anything to do with alcohol.\n\nPlease don't let this derail your efforts to take care of yourself. He is not worth you hurting yourself over. Please take good care of you. You deserve it. And you deserve time to grieve, all the time you need. IWNDWYT",

That\u2019s fucked up, and would seem to be a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality (unless there was anything to indicate that minors were in danger due to the consumption). Not a lawyer, but that\u2019s my main thought.\n\nI would certainly discuss this with the doctor. That could be a major ethics violation.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel great about it, but I wouldn\u2019t take serious issue with the \u201cbad path\u201d remonstrance. For a second I thought that was the \u201cshaming.\u201d\n\nThis doc sounds like an asshole and probably someone who I would not continue to see (assuming this is the whole story of course).\n\nI\u2019m glad to hear there wasn\u2019t any serious repercussion, but yeah, that sounds like major red flag territory.\n\nETA: this hopefully shouldn\u2019t discourage honesty in future. That\u2019s almost always the best policy, both with doctors and from alcoholics. There\u2019s always bad apples out there, but that shouldn\u2019t change the rules.\n\nGood luck, IWNDWYT",

            "body": "Agreed, the \"bad path\" thing is probably okay. Not technically shaming, but truth telling. \n\nWhat's annoying though, is that probably like 90% of us already rationally know it's bad, or that we have a family history, so when you reach out and tell your doctor your concerns, you're not looking for them to turn around and tell you what you already know.  You're looking for some additional help. \n\nThat was definitely not accomplished in your scenario.\n\nAlso, not to downplay the drinking, because at one point in my life, I drank three glasses of wine once a week and then found myself years later drinking two bottles of wine several times a week. it's in my family too. I guess my point is that he probably has a large percentage of patients who are drinking two to three drinks almost nightly. And they are all just lying on that little questionnaire, and apparently, he's that clueless. \n\nGeez...\n\nYour state might have an office of professional misconduct you could call to run the situation by them without saying names. \n\nHopefully, the Union is the only entity that found out and can keep a tight lid on it from your employer. \n\nYou should find this out ASAP. \n\nAs far as attorneys go, you probably only really need to look into this if something happens like the Union tells your employer and there is an adverse employment action. At that point, you're going to want to talk to an attorney as soon as possible because you only have a certain amount of time to bring a civil suit. \n\nThere is somewhere where you can make a complaint about a HIPAA violation, but it'll probably disappear into a dark hole until you're like 85 years old. \n\n\nThe note thing is weird. It sounds like you were asking for a doctor's note for grief? Anxiety? It's possible he's never written one of these before, and so he clung to whatever medical thing he could think of. But it's not like you were out of work getting treatment at a rehab or something. The note should have been reviewed with you. \n\nLast, liver enzymes can look fine in lab work even if the liver is still struggling. I knew this, and the brand new primary care physician I went to several months back also knew this. And I was not shamed at my appointment. I was ordered an ultrasound which showed mild fatty liver despite normal blood work.\n\nPersonally? I would get another doctor. And start with that story and see how they react. If you feel comfortable after that, that's your new doctor.",
