    "selftext": "I initially wanted to go a month without alcohol and felt so much better that I decided to keep it going. I\u2019m on a work trip and when we go out I just order mocktails. The funny thing is I don\u2019t even think my co-workers realize I\u2019m not drinking. I don\u2019t miss it at all. \n\nPrior to this I wasn\u2019t drinking every day, but most days, and I was sick of constantly thinking about alcohol. For years I focused on cutting back which is like a slow torture. I\u2019ve been afraid to quit thinking it would negatively impact my social life, but so far it has only improved. I\u2019m much less anxious and it seems like I\u2019m more fun to be around. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to celebrate these wins with people who drink because it feels like I\u2019m being preachy, so I appreciate being able to share here. \n\nI\u2019ve been lurking on this community for a while, and I\u2019m glad it exists. Thanks to everyone who contributes! ",
