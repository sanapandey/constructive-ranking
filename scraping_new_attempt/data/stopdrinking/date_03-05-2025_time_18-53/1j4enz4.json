I started dating someone sober - on paper he\u2019s perfect, and I thought him being sober would be a plus. Maybe it's projection, but it makes me uncomfortable and feels too close to home and makes me feel weird. Can\u2019t decide if that\u2019s what causing the issue or there just isn\u2019t a connection",

There's too much potential for us to enable each other to relapse. \n\nMy preference is someone who is not in recovery but drinks or uses drugs moderately, which I'd say is most of the people I've dated.",

If they like to have a foofoo drink while on vacation, not an issue. \n\nI also don't think I could date a hardcore 12 step shove it down your throat sober person. Or someone whose whole identity is being sober. \n\nI also think how long someone (you) have been sober is something to consider. How strong their sobriety is. \n\nIWNDWYT",

On the other hand, if someone is sober/in recovery, they have to have *at least* five years in.  I'm unwilling to take a chance with a newbie in recovery, lest they become my problem down the road if they relapse.\n\nWhether someone is sober or not, as u/wholenessISgoodness wrote, \"*you can't force a connection*\" if it's not there.",
