Posting here is a good place to start.  I would suggest that you consider looking into alcoholics anonymous or Al-Anon, if alcohol in your family.  Be gentle on yourself and remember that it\u2019s just one day at a time.",

It's a lot to deal with, but there are many, many young posters on this sub dealing with the exact same thing. And many other sober peeps that share a lot of experiences and wisdom.\n\nMy bet is that you are a good person because of your personal concern for yourself. \n\nI'm glad you're here today. Keep reaching for answers and never give up. Peace.\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",
