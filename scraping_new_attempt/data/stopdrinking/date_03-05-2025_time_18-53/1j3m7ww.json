    "selftext": "Im a sahm and was feeling a bit hard on myself because I've been pretty anxious today sitting around a lot and doom scrolling Reddit. I was thinking about all the stuff I hadn't done. Then it occured to me , these days that I'm lazy isn't nearly as bad as the debilitating hangover id feel atleast once a week after a night of binging. I would lay there paralyzed to the couch , unable to lift a finger. The kids would be destroying the house watching tv all day and getting into things while I laid there trying to fight off throwing up, I couldn't make food , I could hardly make it to the toilet. \n\nToday as lazy as I am I still got 4 loads of laundry done, cleaned the kitchen , I'm still going to make a healthy dinner for my family and then take a long shower and perhaps clean some more.\n\nI certainly do not miss the days where I truly was lazy as lazy can be not lifting one finger because of how sick the poison made me from over doing it. \n\nEven the worst days of sobriety feel a million times better then the day after from my favourite nights of drinking.\n\nIWNDWYT ",

Least that\u2019s what it\u2019s been like for me after the initial first 2-3 days. Without thinking I suddenly do the laundry, make a delicious breakfast, vacuum\u2026 all those dull things. And professionally I suddenly behave like a Ferrari (and found back to pleasure in working!) \u2026 \n\nYour words describe so well how I feel too\u2026 when I go to sleep at night, I say thanks for that incredible shift in life in a more genuine way that I have been able to give thanks in years.",
