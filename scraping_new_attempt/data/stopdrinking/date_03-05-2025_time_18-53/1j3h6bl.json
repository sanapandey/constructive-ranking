    "selftext": "Hi all, I've been following this page for a while for inspiration. I'll admit I've thought many times in the past that I could start today but didn't do it. I was laying in bed last night after wine thinking \"I didn't even enjoy the second glass, I just drank it to relax... is this really it for me?\" woke up this morning knowing I need to be a better and healthier version for myself. I want to be that for those around me too. I already struggle with anxiety, which ironically is another reason I drink, despite it giving me MORE anxiety in the morning and I'm actually even anxious to stop. \n\nYears ago I was sober for a month for a fitness challenge but besides that, never since I was probably 16. Part of me is scared to change, but part of me knows there can be so much good waiting for me on the other side if I just find a way to get there. \n\n  \nI'm tired of feeling like shit, looking like shit, and my body suffering the consequences more and more as I keep getting older. \n\n  \nI want today to be the day, I'm just scared / anxious to do it on my own.",

Glad you posted, Everyone here has had to get through day 1 (some a lot more than others) but to get to the sober side you have to start at day 1. I know from experience (45+ years of daily drinking) the shit you are going through now is nothing compared to what awaits down the road. Stopping now is a GREAT plan and one you will never regret. The first few days may be hard but it does get better. Get a plan in place that suits you. Books, podcasts, youtube vids, in person meetings (AA eg). Whatever works. If something doesn't click with you, so what, it's your plan. Good luck and keep coming back here. IWNDWYT",
