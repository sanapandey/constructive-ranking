    "selftext": "So just over 2 months after a terrible night and my commitment to quit still stronge in my head and my heart. I was cleaning my room, minding my own bussiness trying to get myself in order, while clearning a can rolled out from somewhere. I knew this was an oppurtunity, a chance to refresh my commitment to leaving that awful thing behind, i went to the sink, opened it up and poured that poison that crashed my life down the drain and as it went away i said I will not drink with you tonight!! Great win.",
