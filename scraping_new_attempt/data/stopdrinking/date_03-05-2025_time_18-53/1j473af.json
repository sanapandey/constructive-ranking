    "selftext": "I have been a high functioning alcoholic for 3 years. Drinking in the evenings and on the weekends. We began dating in September and I fell so hard for him\u2026 He has strong boundaries and has always told himself he wouldn\u2019t date someone with an addiction but fell for me before he realized I did (and before I came to terms with the fact that I AM an alcoholic). December 23rd I got blackout and caused a problem. He said he wanted to leave me then but loved me too much. February 1st he came to my place and found a bottle of tequila I had hidden, from myself, because I was trying to do better, and almost broke up with me that day. I didn\u2019t tell him I had drank the night before because I was ashamed. I had planned on telling him when I saw him the next night as I didn\u2019t want to tell him over the phone\u2026 but he found it before I had a chance.\nThat was my last day of binging. We had a couple of drinks for dinners and casually but I didn\u2019t binge for 26 days\u2026 which is HUGE for me. But, we went out with friends last Friday evening and I had 5 drinks and a shot and I accidentally embarrassed him\u2026 and that was it. He broke up with me that night on the way home. I am beyond devastated\u2026 I love him so much and I was doing SO good. I was putting so much effort into my sobriety and into OUR relationship because I would do anything for him\u2026. But he gave up on me. I feel like I\u2019m dying inside. I put so much effort to be better for myself and for us and I failed us, I failed him. He says he still loves me but he can\u2019t deal with my setbacks and doesn\u2019t want to be with an alcoholic\u2026 \nWhy do I have to have this disease? Why did I ever begin it? Why couldn\u2019t I have stopped immediately and never picked it back up? All I want is him and the future I saw for us. \nI am beginning therapy on April 7th with an addictions counselor. I am so ANGRY at alcohol, I hate it with everything in me right now. I can\u2019t let alcohol ruin the good things in my life any longer. Today is day 5 without it. No more \u201ccasual\u201d drinks, as that isn\u2019t how it can work for me as much as I want it to. ",

Why would I stay with someone that over and over again showed me they don't put me first but I have to always put them first. <-- that's what my wife asked me in response to \"why are we splitting up?\" Once I asked myself that same question it clicked. \nMy wife wasn't responsible for my drinking so shouldn't be responsible for my sobriety either. I also didn't drink for my wife so can't get sober for her either.   See what I'm hinting at with all this? \n\nI've now been sober 8 years and we will celebrate 16 years of marriage in a couple months. But I had to get myself sober, another big help was realizing that massive lie we tell ourselves about being \"functioning alcoholics\".  Hahahaha no such thing lol",

Of course I didn\u2019t mean literally /anything/ lol but I did think he would stay to at least see if there was truly any hope as I have only just began my journey in the very beginning of February. But he has his own personal limitations and I have to respect that, as hard as it is.\n\nYeah for sure, \u201cfunctional\u201d is a lie I tell myself to make me feel better lol",

He controlled it much better and didn't get blackout but it was still a problem. My mom never left. \n\nNow they're in sort of a weird sad limbo where they're just together because it's easiest. But my sister and I have had a lot of open conversations about how his continued drinking impacted EVERYTHING in our upbringing even if we didn't notice it at the time.

When in reality the three of us (sister, mom, and I) are the ones with the emotional and mental scars and the only scars he has are on his liver.",

Its not fair to them, and I wouldn't expect my partner to treat me any differently if I did something to hurt them like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course there is a nuance to it all, alcoholism isn't something we choose, its debilitating and often out of our control (hence why we're here) BUT we HAVE to learn how to control our actions, like picking up the bottle or not picking it up. If we tell ourselves we aren't in control then we allow ourselves to be free of blame and responsibility, and its not fair to us to let something else control us. We all deserve better, but we have to work **hard** for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck, I hope this is your rock bottom and you're able to get the help you need. \ud83d\udda4",

I was destroying myself, until another shameful episode of drinking somehow awoke me: no more. The whole episode helped me to come to terms with me being an alcoholic. I'm 50 days sober now, and it helped me to reach out to her again, expressing my understanding towards her (she suffered quite a lot, something I realized only properly after being sober for a while ).

My partner said that they can\u2019t deal with my drinking anymore, was tired of being embarrassed, tired of seeing me flirt with random people (even though I swear I wasn\u2019t, but I know I get too giggly/touchy when I\u2019m drunk), and was tired of the empty promises every time I said I was done. \n\nHonestly, I tried drinking in moderation, tried taking breaks, tried being kinder/less flirty/less belligerent when I did drink\u2026 tried what I thought was everything. And I felt pretty helpless at the hands of alcohol. But early last month, I finally had this internal switch where I said \u201cenough. I don\u2019t want to be hungover anymore. I want to like myself again.\u201d So I stopped drinking, fully. \n\nIt sucks to even admit, but I couldn\u2019t make that change for my partner, regardless of the deep love I have and the desire to be what they want. I could only make that change once the flip in my own brain said \u201cman, I don\u2019t want this for myself anymore.\u201d \n\nIt hurts so bad. I feel you and you\u2019re not alone. This community has been amazing for me in maintaining this change in my life, but I also recommend removing all reminders of drinking and filling that time with something completely new.
