    "selftext": "Tw: relapse\n\nSo I relapsed about 2 or so weeks ago and have been drinking pretty heavy again. There wasn't much of a buildup this time is just went from 0 to 50 to 100 so fast.\n\nTried to quit again yesterday after drinking far too much (and far far more than I intended) and waking up on the floor with one of the worst hangovers I've ever experienced in my life.\n\nSince then, my anxiety has been through the roof. I've been getting suicidal thoughts and the urges to drink to remove all these emotions are so incredibly high despite knowing it's what's causing it.\n\nThe nausea has just been making it so much worse because I haven't been able to see anyone.\n\nConsidered going to an AA meeting, but I couldn't drag myself out of bed (online one wasn't really an option due to Internet issues).\n\nI don't really know what I can do right now to help myself. If anyone has any suggestions let me know :)\n\nAlso sorry abt my flair, it needs changing",
