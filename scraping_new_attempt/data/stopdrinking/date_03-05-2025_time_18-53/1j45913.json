In the book Carl faces all sorts of shit and at his darkest he says, \u201cyou will not break me\u201d his mantra for keeping himself, and not letting all the bullshit change who he is as a person. \n\nThis morning, I saw the bottles of wine in my fridge, full and glistening. I grabbed both, popped them open and started saying, \u201cI will win, not you\u2026 you will not break me\u201d as I poured it all down the drain. \n\nThat\u2019s it. No wine in the house. I won today, and alcohol, YOU WILL NOT BREAK ME. ",
