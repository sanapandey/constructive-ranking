Until.. I\u2019d see him passed out drunk, listening to the same 3 heartbreak songs he always plays, then I remember \u201cOh yeah.. don\u2019t miss that\u201d \n\nPlay the tape forward and remember it also comes with a debilitating hangover. And another trip to the liquor store first thing in the morning\n\nThe hassle of it all, meh. Seems too long, for that 30 second blip of \u201cWhat if\u2019s\u201d that come with wanting to drink.",

But then I remember that I\u2019m the one with the problem not her. So I\u2019m learning to keep the focus on myself as best I can. \nOf course your situation is different than mine but the principle is the same. I\u2019m doing this for me not her. I can\u2019t expect the world to change just because I am. Accepting the things I can not change is my daily battle. \nIWNDWYT",

            "body": "My wife still drinks but nothing like I did. We talk about it as my comfort level has changed over time and it\u2019s important but I had to figure some shit out on my own first. Boundaries were a new concept for me and I honestly needed to learn how to talk about it without getting defensive, shutting down or lashing out. I needed to get out of my head and being around other alcoholics in recovery provided that outlet and guidance. I think my perception problem is just as bad as my drinking one so I really have to work on letting shit go and not taking things personally. I didn\u2019t get sober to change what other people say or do but I\u2019m allowed to have boundaries.\n\nEarly on, we talked about not keeping bottles of wine in the fridge to die for months and I didn\u2019t like feeling like it was being hidden from me. Not a big deal. She\u2019s supportive and wants to help but I learned I have to get the words out of my mouth for that to work. How I say it matters so I try to flush out what\u2019s going on with me instead of trying to read minds. We\u2019ve given eachother permission to talk about it but it took some work to get there. She was willing to work on it because I took the actions for my sobriety first. I never intended on hurting anyone with my drinking but I had to come to terms with the resentment it created and do some work on myself before I could ask someone to work with me. There\u2019s lots of help out there if you want it",
