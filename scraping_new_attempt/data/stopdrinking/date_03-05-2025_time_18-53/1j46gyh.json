    "selftext": "I already know that today will be the hardest. I don\u2019t work today and really only have plans to go to the movies tonight with my dad. He offered to get us dinner before and I purposefully picked a place that doesn\u2019t serve alcohol. Typically we both get a drink when we meet up for dinner.\n\nI thought about telling him about quitting alcohol but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to share with anyone but my husband yet. I\u2019m lucky enough that my problems controlling my intake and actions didn\u2019t start until I was in my late 20s and removed from that side of the family. Its nice to have people in my life who actually don\u2019t know how dark it got at times.",

Perhaps in awhile you can tell your dad, but only when you are ready. You don't have to tell any of the dark stuff, it's your story to control. Good luck and keep coming back here. IWNDWYT",
