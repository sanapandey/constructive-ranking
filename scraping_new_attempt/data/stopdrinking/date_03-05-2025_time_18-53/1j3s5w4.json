    "selftext": "Ten years ago, husband and I would land; check in; grab an eight ball; and drink the morning, day, and night away barely eating. The day before heading home we\u2019d be so dead and sick laid up in the hotel room. \n\nTwo years ago, I was sober. Husband would leave the hotel and go to the bar by himself while I was at the hotel reading/sleeping. He would be hammered a lot whilst I was sober. It was annoying and defeating.\n\nThis year, I relapsed around the holidays. We had a serious conversation how we were BOTH problem drinkers. We stopped drinking January 8th, 2025. \n\nThis week, we went to Fort Lauderdale and had our first sober vacation together. It was fucking fabulous. \n\nHome, unpacked already, and totally relaxed. \n\nSobriety has a lot of growth. ",
