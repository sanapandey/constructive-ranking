    "selftext": "basically the question is in the title. \n\nIt has been 3 days since my last drink, coming off the back of a nasty 4 month relapse. In that time I met someone, showed them the worst version of myself, and they dumped me for this disease on Sunday - as is their right! It\u2019s been a big few days of reflection. \n\nI\u2019m finally coming to terms with the fact I will never be able to drink again. I can\u2019t have a casual beer or glass of wine. It\u2019s never one. I need to never touch alcohol again. \n\nAt the moment that is terrifying, because my whole life revolves around drinking. every day i think about it. every hour even. probably multiple times an hour. Will I ever be at peace with this realisation? I really can\u2019t foresee a life for myself where I\u2019m fighting tooth and nail every day to abstain, just to stay miserable. I want to live a happy life. \n\nAny advice/personal experience is greatly appreciated. Thank you",

Hobson's Choice, really, but if you tell me I *can't* drink, my awkward sod of a mind will revolt. Tell me I *can,* and I will choose not to because -- as with you -- it's never one. Never was, never will be. So just for today (never mind tomorrow, let tomorrow look after itself) I am choosing not to drink even though I could if I wanted to. I'm not abstaining. I'm just choosing to put the bottle aside to do something else, some activity I like. \n\nSo far so good.",

Find a therapist to supplement self-help books like Carr's. \n\n- - - - \n\nSpending your whole life using will power to resist a craving is at best torture, and at worst, unsustainable. The best way to succeed is to not WANT to drink in the first place, that way there are no cravings to resist. If someone offered me a syringe of heroin, it wouldn't take \"will power\" to resist it. Allen Carr basically helps you get to that same point with alcohol.\n\nI recommend his book. But I will say that he radically over simplifies the process of gaining sobriety. Understanding on an intellectual level that alcohol really does nothing positive for you, that it's all the result of a \"confidence trick\", doesn't immediately translate into an emotional or subconscious understanding of it. The process of getting your subconscious/irrational mind (limbic system, responsible for desires) on the same page as your conscious/rational mind (pre frontal cortex, responsible for desires and cravings) takes work and a lot of neural rewiring. Especially if you've been a heavy drinker for a long time. \n\nYou can get to where Carr wants you to get to, but very few can achieve such a huge cognitive shift overnight as he suggests. OP's best bet is to read the book, and combine it with therapy to achieve the alignment I described above. And by therapy, I don't mean some former corporate type who got bored of the rat race and took a course in psychology for easier money doing \"counseling\". I mean an actual PhD / PsyD with a deep understanding of neuroplasticity.",

I think in the book he acknowledges that alcohol does give you some kind of a dopamine hit (the buzz) and that it can give a feeling of pleasure, even if it's an illusion of pleasure. I asked Chat GPT what he'd say if he was still alive. This is what I got:\n\nI don\u2019t deny that alcohol physically alters your state\u2014it\u2019s a drug, after all. Yes, it gives you a buzz.\n\nBut the \u2018buzz\u2019 is just mild poisoning of your nervous system. It doesn\u2019t create genuine pleasure\u2014it just dulls your brain\u2019s ability to process reality.\n\nThe \u2018uplift\u2019 is not real happiness or confidence\u2014it\u2019s just your brain struggling to function properly.\n\nI don\u2019t deny that:\n- Alcohol causes a chemical change in the brain.\n- That change can feel pleasurable in the short term.\n- People experience a buzz, lower inhibitions, and altered mood.\n\nWhat I Reject Is the Illusion That the Buzz Is Beneficial. The buzz isn\u2019t adding anything positive\u2014it\u2019s just temporarily suppressing reality. The cost always outweighs the \u2018benefit\u2019, even if the cost is delayed.\nIf alcohol actually created genuine happiness, confidence, or relaxation\u2014you wouldn\u2019t need another drink an hour later.\n\nSo yes, alcohol gives you a buzz. But what you\u2019re really asking is: Does that buzz actually improve my life? And once you see that it doesn\u2019t, the desire for the buzz disappears altogether.",

My only counterpoint would be that an endorphin rush is the same no matter the source, your brain doesn't care about the difference, \"real\" or synthesized.

He'd say cocaine is a social lubricant for the same artificial reasons that alcohol is. But the reason we treat booze differently is due to centuries of social normalization, marketing, media, etc. He'd push back on the very idea that anything other than the social gathering itself should serve as a social lubricant. He might even say that the belief that social situations can be lubricated artificially is part of the problem we all need to acknowledge. I don't know if he says this in the book, but I think that if alcohol hadnt been discovered by the Greeks / Romans etc, and someone discovered it yesterday, it would be immediately made illegal.

We all want to get away from, or manage, pain and suffering; the addictive belief is that there is a way to get to that suffering-free state through the substance.  Which is not actually true, because the substance just temporarily blocks *awareness* of suffering by distracting us from it -!and then as we know, piles that awareness up for later.

In my experience, all of the horrible skin crawling feelings and sensations were ultimately placed in the \"early sobriety bucket.\" That is, the realization that I drowned my brain and body with so much ethanol, the only normal physical and psychological reaction I could possibly have after removing this substance was, at times, insanity, but most frequently, pure discomfort. It's like the rule \"don't listen to any broad reflections about your life after 9pm.\" For me it was like that, but for months after stopping drinking. As many other folks have and will share, I can always refund my own misery. The bottle ain't going anywhere. What's stopping me is the overwhelming goodness and transformation sobriety has given me. I can honestly say that, while it is challenging to live sober in a booze soaked world sometimes, today I genuinely do not desire a drink. \n\nOne of my big hang-ups in early sobriety is the bewilderment about \"not having a glass of champagne at my wedding.\" I was advised to worry about that ONLY when that day comes. If I kept drinking, that day would have never come, for reasons ranging from the inability to ever find someone who would marry a drunk like I was, to simply not being alive.

I decided to take a full year off, instead of just a few weeks or a month. I had been able to do those shorter stints, but always fell back into my same habits. Maybe a full year would do the trick, I reckoned.\n\nI had a very important goal to be a \u201cmoderate drinker.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know that would look like for me; Drinking only on the weekends and never more than one drink? Maybe two on special occasions? One glass of wine at dinner at night and that\u2019s it? But wait.... what if an old college buddy came to town to visit? Could I \u2014 once in blue moon of course! \u2014 sit at a bar with an old friend and knock back a few shots, for old times sake? What about a ski trip? A hot apres-ski rum and apple cider? like once a year! I spent a lot of time and energy during that first year planning and stressing on how much consumption I would allow myself to consider myself a 'moderate drinker.'\n\nIn retrospect, I can see the reason I spent all that time trying to conceptualize the idea of a \u2018moderate drinker.\u2019 and then desperately aspiring for that, was because the idea of never drinking again was too terrifying. From my puberty years on, alcohol was a critical component to living my life. I didn\u2019t really understand how to live without it. Shit, I didn\u2019t even know how to fall asleep at night without (at least) a good buzz.\n\nBut at some point during that year, I started to coming to the liberating realization that I\u2019m capable of living life sober. Not only that but life got better for me, quite literally, in every way. Once the addiction was broken and I learned how to enjoy all those times, vacations, visits with old friends, dinner, weekends, etc. without alcohol, there was no reason to want to reintroduce alcohol into my life. Even if I could beat the odds and go from \u2018problem drinker,\u2019 \u2018heavy drinker,\u2019 or the more fatal-sounding term \u2018alcoholic,\u2019 to \u2018moderate drinker.\u2019 Fuck all those types of drinkers, I\u2019m sober.

My boyfriend was concerned one night cause I was cracking jokes left and right and laughing, and he thought I relapsed lol. \nAlcohol adds nothing of value to your life (at least mine) and quite honestly, 3 months into sobriety, I don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019ve handled Christmas, new years, birthdays, valentines, etc since becoming sober and didn\u2019t even want a mocktail. \nI\u2019m so happy to never touch that poison again, I\u2019ve started going back to the gym, enjoying not having panic attacks daily, sleeping better, feeling better, and not being a gross puffy mess. The only thing I can say, is I wish I realized this sooner rather than finally getting my shxt together because of cirrhosis! But, can\u2019t live life in what ifs and I wishes.\nCongrats friend!
