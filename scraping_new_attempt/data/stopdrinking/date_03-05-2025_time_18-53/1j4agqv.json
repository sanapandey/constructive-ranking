It\u2019s lifelong sure, but the more you don\u2019t allow yourself to take part in the disease, the better you feel. Every single day I wake up, I feel great. In a good mood and not hungover. I will never take another morning for granted and put myself back in that position again. \n\nThankful is a weird word to use. I\u2019m not thankful for all of the problems it has caused in my personal life and I\u2019m not thankful that it ruined a relationship. But I\u2019m thankful for what\u2019s on the other side of sobriety and I\u2019m excited for it. \n\nHappy Hump Day and IWNDWYT. \ud83c\udf25\ufe0f ",

I was telling myself it\u2019s only been like 6 years of 6 month or so daily and then a short break I have nothing to worry about. It finally clicked with me this time that I was acting and thinking exactly like an alcoholic, I am an alcoholic, it doesn\u2019t matter how long I\u2019ve been doing this it\u2019s something I have to address now. I was at it for about 6 months so getting to the point of my normal what I was calling detox. Monday morning instead of setting a date saying no beers until April 3rd like I used to I said no more beers. I\u2019m only on day 2 but I\u2019m feeling a very different hopefulness than I\u2019ve ever felt going into my \u201cbreaks.\u201d IWNDWYT",

I\u2019m thankful that I haven\u2019t but at the end of the day, I don\u2019t have to experience those things in order to know that those would be in my distant future at some point or another if I didn\u2019t stop drinking.
