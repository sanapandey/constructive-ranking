It just sucks and I'm feeling like shit. My insecurities about myself seem to be hitting harder now. I don't want to feel like this and I don't want to deal with this. I'm writing this in hopes that it will somehow help. ",

Breakups suck *ss.\nOnly advice I can give is try and distract yourself and also to just take time to feel all the emotions and cry if you have to. \nAt least you can be sure it will take time, but it won't last forever. In a couple weeks/months you'll already feel a lot better I'm sure.",

It is so hard and feels impossible to not continuously think about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. But I would not be able to manage all the stress around it if I was drinking and hungover. Being sober and present and of clear mind is what keeps me looking forward instead of back. You might think that drinking will help temporarily alleviate the pain, but will it make you be the best version of yourself and someone you can depend on? More than ever you deserve the best version of yourself as you learn to become your own best friend. I know how lonely and hard it is but please know you are worthy of love (especially from yourself) and we are here with you. I hope you can reach out to a friend or family member or do something nice for yourself today. Sending strength and hugs.",
