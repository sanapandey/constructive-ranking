    "selftext": "I had to call out of work today because I was so hungover. It was the fourth time I\u2019ve had to do that already this year. \n\nThis morning I worked up the courage to finally tell my husband that I wanted to try quitting and he was very supportive. He rarely drinks so I\u2019m lucky that it will be easy to not have any alcohol in the house. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about going to meetings but the one time I went before it was very God focused which isn\u2019t something helpful for me since I don\u2019t believe.\n\nHowever today has already been a struggle since he left for work. I\u2019ve been trying to distract myself with the cats and food. I know that for me my alcohol addiction really started after I had my gastric sleeve. My food addiction transferred to an alcohol addiction. And eating just doesn\u2019t do it for me like it used to.\n\nI have two more hours until he gets home. And I\u2019m stuck inside since its pouring rain. I don\u2019t know what to do with myself when drinking isn\u2019t an option. It seems like all I\u2019ve been doing for years is just work and then come home and drink and watch tv. And then on my days off I\u2019ll do chores and then its back to drinking. I would purposely plan stuff earlier in the day on my days off so I could be home and drinking by 4-5pm.\n\nI\u2019m hoping that scrolling reddit and writing this can help me get through the rest of my day.",

I primarily go to SMART but sometimes go to AA during the day to hang out with sober women. \n\nIWNDWYT!",
