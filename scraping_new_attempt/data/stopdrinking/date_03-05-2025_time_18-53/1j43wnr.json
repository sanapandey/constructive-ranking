When does the sleep get better? It honestly feels like someone is poking my voodoo doll all night constantly forcing me to wake up. And don\u2019t get me started on the stomach pain at night. ",

After about the first month, sleep started improving, and I was getting some of the best sleep in my life by month 3.   Hang in there. You got this!  \n\nHere's a timeline of what to expect: \nhttps://www.columbusrecoverycenter.com/alcohol-addiction/quitting-benefits/",

Instead of falling asleep like a normal sober person, I think I'd just been passing out at night for several years.\n\nAfter 3 or 4 days of nearly zero sleep while in withdrawal, I went to my doctor and _begged_ for some pills.  He reluctantly wrote a prescription for a few days worth of pills but insisted that I see a sleep specialist.\n\nThe sleep specialists emphasized a need for good \"sleep hygiene\" and I think you could benefit from browsing some websites that talk about good \"sleep hygiene\".\n\nMy withdrawal was Bloody Awful.  I say it was like a bad flu with a touch of psychosis thrown in.  The worst of it was over after about 4 or 6 days, though the second week was still a bit unpleasant.  Small price to pay for years/decades of **Splendid Sobriety!**\n\n#_IWNDWYT!_",

Hot shower or bath before bed and sleepy time tea also helped me a lot.\n\nWith serious stomach pain, it might be worth checking with a doctor. Some gut stuff is definitely normal as it recalibrates, but pain to the point of sleep-deprivation sounds concerning to this not-doctor.\n\nWishing you peace, health and some damn Z\u2019s!\n\nIWNDWYT",
