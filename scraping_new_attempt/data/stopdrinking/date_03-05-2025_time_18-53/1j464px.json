It gets so much better when you do!! \n\nEvery other time I posted a milestone I was really sad. I'm not today \u263a\ufe0f I'm making better choices even if I still doubt myself. I'm being me again! Someone recently told me this is not your endgame. It's not! I'm healing and getting better all the time. I have more to do. I'm grateful alcohol doesn't control me anymore and I'm finally able to do whatever I set my mind to! \n\nIWNDWYT \u2764\ufe0f ",

I'm hoping to get there in a few months too!\u00a0\n\n\nI'm too sat here thankful that alcohol isn't controlling me. 2 years ago I'd have easily been sat drinking outside about now (sun is shining in Birmingham, UK for the first time in months) but today I'm sat with a cup of tea, whilst a few friends have a beer.\u00a0",

We never go long without sunshine here, and we wait for the days the clouds come out. I'm looking forward to the rain this afternoon and one of our last cool fronts for winter. \n\nIt feels good to know you don't have to drink it. Something else inside of you finally has control again. not a drink",
