    "selftext": "Feeling ashamed (NOT from drinking!). 3rd time in the ER today in the past few weeks. I told them I keep feeling like I'm going to pass out, I have pressure in my head and heart palpitations. Brain zaps were bad. I took an Uber to the ER...a different one since the other hospital I went to a few times in the past 2 weeks is obviously fed up with me and did absolutely nothing the last time I went yesterday. \n\nI was there at the other ER from 11:15am-6pm today. I got an IV bag and a separate bag of magnesium. They did an EKG and put me on a heart monitor. I do have \"prolonged QT\" on the EKG which can be caused by my asthma inhaler. They also did an ultrasound of my abdomen. I have fatty liver and enlarged liver, which I knew, but I also have a gallstone and \"sludge\" in my gallbladder which I was never told I had before...which is making my stomach a little distended.\n\nThere's an app called MyChart where your results appear as soon as they're ready. The doctor ordered a hepatic function test and I saw that my ALT, AST and bilirubin were higher than last time. I lost it crying uncontrollably before I was able to talk to the doctor, figuring I was dying and really f*cked up and my daughter would grow up without a mother, etc. Because I couldn't stop crying and my heart rate was high 80s they gave me something for anxiety. When I got there my blood pressure surprisingly wasn't even that high. Definitely much lower than I expected which is good. The nurse said my home bp machine is probably wrong. Neat.\n\nThe anxiety med helped a lot. The nurse and doctor were absolutely wonderful. Amazing people. This will be my preferred hospital from now on. It's only 2 mins further away than the other one. \n\nAnyway, I was discharged with a diagnosis of elevated liver levels and anxiety and told to follow up with my GI doctor and cardiologist. I have appointments coming up with both next week. The amazing doctor told me that liver levels can go up or down for many reasons but that it's NOT liver failure nor ascites by any means but to just watch my levels, I wasn't having a heart attack or stroke and prescribed the anxiety med to take at home for a few days. (Can't take it long term which is fine.) \n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me vent. You all are absolutely amazing and wonderful. I'm glad I'm okay and not dying after all. The brain zaps subsided as did the tingling in my legs. My blood pressure was normal the entire time. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nThis is some horrible, horrific sh*t though. I can't stand it...but I'm going to keep on keeping on. I'm going to keep going for my daughter...and for myself.\n\nCurrently drinking some lemon ginger tea and listening to my daughter laugh while she plays her MetaQuest VR.\n\nAgain, IWNDWYT. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\ud83d\ude4f\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I'm not drinking and then going to the ER. I think I may have confused some people.",

You got the best of the three.\n\nYour doctor was right. Alcohol can do a real number on your lover and GI system, but sometimes can be addressed with supplements or medication (combined with abstinence from alcohol). And anxiety is hugely related to alcoholism (mine too). That's a more long term thing to deal with, but alcohol generally makes the problem much worse long term.",

Try not to sweat that issue at least, because just 1 week off the drink can have a drastic positive impact on BP levels.  \n  \nAlso, I'm gonna guess they gave you a benzo while you were there since it helped so well with the anxiety and relatively quickly.",

The vomiting never got better and I couldn't hold anything down until after I threw up my first shot, to which eventually I couldn't even hold liquor down. My period pretty much stopped. I was sure I was in premenopause too lol. I can assure you now that I wasn't. Damnit. I wish I had the foresight to stop after the third ER trip. On a lighter note, I haven't used my wheelchair in over a month and feel mostly comfortable enough to walk in stores without falling. Neuropathy is a bitch.
