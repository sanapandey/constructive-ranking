    "selftext": "Not much I know but I feel really good I\u2019ve had really dark moments for sure but I\u2019m working through them and not trying to substitute through the hard times too much I feel that for myself I have to because I\u2019m scared that if I try to distract myself too much or too often when I\u2019m finally needing to sit with it it\u2019ll just be too much. I\u2019ve cried a lot but also laughed and thoroughly enjoyed being in the moment. Simple things are stating to feel less boring and more relaxed. Still having a hard time as the evening and weekends approach as that\u2019s when I would drink but I had my first weekend come and go without one drink. I will not drink today. I might tomorrow but not today is something that has helped with the anxiety of the \u201cforever\u201d being too big for me. The word forever is something I learned triggers me for now so saying it in a way that lets me feel I\u2019m in control is helping me so much. I hope you all beautiful souls have a wonderful day and remember you are worth it. Hug yourselves and be proud of who you are in all your chapters \ud83d\udc97",
