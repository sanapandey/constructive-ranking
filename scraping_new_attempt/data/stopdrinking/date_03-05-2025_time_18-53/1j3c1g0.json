    "selftext": "After years of barely managing and a conversation with my partner I decided to take the leap and go into detox. I went to an ER, waited 6 hours, was told they have no social worker on staff and sent home after 1am with 'resources', a sheet of paper with numbers I've already anxiously researched. There's too much context about how this month has been going for me to sum it up but it feels like every time I say \"no, this time will be different, I'll really show up for myself and people will meet me\" I get emotionally suplexed by the medical system. I'm on the morning after anxiously pacing my apartment. I don't understand what I did wrong, should I go back to an emergency room? My NP refered me to a treatment center that only does outpatient counseling, I'm drinking well over a pint of liquor a day. I can't be trusted on my own. I told myself if yesterday didn't work out I'd keep trying, but now I'm feeling it was a cosmic sign I'm just meant to be a drunk. I feel so alone. ",
