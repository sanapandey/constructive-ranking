I always wanted to look like I was SO tolerant even of unhealthy people or people I don't like or see eye to eye with, but you know what, I'm tired of doing that. Maybe I had to numb out to tolerate these people and situations and I am trying not to do that anymore. IWNDWYT",

My twin brother is an alcoholic and the stupid annoying shit he does while drinking makes me want to drink ironically. \n\nWhat helps me is getting space, go for a walk a drive.

Like helping out with dishes or anything just to keep busy. For every time I managed to be around them without drinking the triggering feeling got easier to handle. I grew my distance to them and it made me feel proud about myself and reminded me that I\u2019m on a good track.",
