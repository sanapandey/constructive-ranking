    "selftext": "I don't even enjoy it anymore! Since I started my sober journey in June, alcohol isn't wven enjoyable.. I don't enjoy the feeling of being bogged down when inebriated, sometimes I even get immediate anxiety & no matter how many I drink I feel shame & fatigue the next day. I have a support system in my family. My spouse had cut down significantly, but he still drinks because he's not the one who has a problem & he generally doesn't say anything about my drinking because that's not his job. I lament to him about my frustration on not saying no even though the negatives outweigh the positives (which are none). He tells me... just don't drink! Just say no! But why is something so simple not sinking into my head? I don't even enjoy it anymore.\n\nThankfully I just started therapy and I'm going to try to dissect these feelings today. And maybe it's finally time to accept the help in AA, something I had been avoiding.",

On a sunny summer day around 4 in the afternoon when I\u2019d want to start pounding drinks and grilling I\u2019d read what I journaled about, play the tape forward, and associated booze with the pending doom it brought me. It sounds like you have a grasp on all that. Being able to immerse myself in the negative emotions from drinking allowed me to see it for what it is. \n\nIt\u2019s like euphoric recall from a toxic ex.",
