Social events, celebrations, even just relaxing at home meant drinking was always part of the equation.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve quit I\u2019m learning how to enjoy things without it, but it\u2019s wild how much I have to **retrain my brain** to see fun, stress relief and even boredom without reaching for a drink. Anyone else feel like this was the biggest adjustment?",

It sucks, you're rebuilding your life as well as your health.\n\nThe thing is, the neural networks in your brain has fortified it with everything. Fun? Drink. Bored? Drink. Sad? Drink. Happy? Happy drink. Your brain needs time to fight this habit, for me anyway, it's all habitual.",

It's really weird now when I just decide I'm gonna run an errand or drive to do something after 5 pm now, because for the past three years or so, I have very, very rarely been sober enough to drive in the evenings.\n\nI also bought a guitar and some puzzles, been reading a ton too, just trying to throw hobbies at the wall and see what sticks.",

I didnt drink when bad things occured, I found a reason to drink when anything good happened....Lol. Give yourself time, be kind to youself and get to know the sober you again.",
