    "selftext": "I've never completely blacked out but I've humiliated myself so many times. From dancing with strangers to full on making out with them. Then I feel awful about it in the morning because I remember every single detail. I'm not sure when this behavior started happening but it's so scary to think that I have no boundaries. I'm swearing off alcohol because this promiscuity and lack of awareness can lead me to a lot of trouble. ",

But then it goes completely overboard. But yes I will heed your advice and quit while I'm ahead. IWNDWYT.",
