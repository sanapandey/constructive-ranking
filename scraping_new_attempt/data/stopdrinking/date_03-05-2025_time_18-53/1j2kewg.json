I had 2 NA beers last night with zero desire to have any more.  I wish I could've done that with regular beers!  I would be basically a \"normal\" drinker if I could just enjoy 2 beers and call it a day.  But I know I can't do that for some reason.\n\nAnyone else out there able to drink a couple of NAs and that's it, or am I just weird?  \n\nIWNDWYT!",

When we drink alcohol, we not only get the buzz of inebriation, but a dopamine rush as well and you have to keep drinking to maintain that same level or more of the dopamine rush. With an NA beer you're getting about the same dopamine hit that you would get with a soda...probably less actually if you're comparing it to a full sugar soda.\n\nI drink NA beers on occasion, but I was always more of a cocktail guy and I enjoy some nice mocktails with Ritual NA booze substitutes and it works the same way...I might have a few while I'm grilling and hanging out by the pool with my friends and family but I'm not drinking a dozen of them.",
