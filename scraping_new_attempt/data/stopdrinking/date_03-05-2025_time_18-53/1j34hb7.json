    "selftext": "From 2012-2017 it was booze and Xanax. Boy was that a fuzzy time. Lots of sleep. Lots of embarrassment. \n2017-2020 mostly sober. Got my health back, got my looks back, my friends back, my respect back. \n2020-9 days ago: Lost my best friend at 32, got whiplash from a car accident, and then covid. It then became booze and Percocet. The one needed the other. Together they made me numb. Solo I still felt too much. \nI have never been out of control with alcohol without while also abusing prescription pills. It\u2019s probably why in the back of my mind I\u2019ve always wondered if I was truly an alcoholic or if my real addiction was pill popping. Either way, no more 2nd chances with the wife. Time to\nGrow up. Just wondered if I\u2019m the only one with  a combo lifestyle like this? ",

Took me passing out at the wheel and getting my 3rd dui to finally realize what I was doing. Luckily by the grace of god didn\u2019t hurt anyone, but my lord was that a slap in the face to wake the fuck up and get my act together. Was about 12-13 years pretty consistent too. Checked myself in to treatment and am now on 64 days clean, longest I\u2019ve been in all those years and even though I have consequences to deal with, it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve ever made and I feel the best I\u2019ve ever felt. Stop while you can man, it\u2019s all a temporary fix for a long term problem. Besides the fact that this combo can kill you easily, it just ain\u2019t worth the bad that can eventually happen. Best of luck to you brother",
