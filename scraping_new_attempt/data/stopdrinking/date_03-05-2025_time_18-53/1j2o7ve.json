    "selftext": "Let's preface by saying I've been smoking 1-4 cigarettes a day, and I think it contributed to my symptoms. (Finally threw away my pack this morning. Wish me luck.)\n\nLast Friday after work, I had nothing to do (I've been feeling extremely lonely these days, and I'm working from home), so I decided to go to a restaurant nearby to grab something to eat quickly and maybe have a beer. One beer turned into 4-5 shots of whiskey and 2 beers... I wasn't THAT drunk, but I clearly drank more than I had intended.\n\nI got home around 11 PM, smoked a cigarette, and went straight to bed. That's when the nightmare began.\n\nI woke up the next day (and consider that I still feel somewhat this way three days later) with these symptoms: low fever, general intense fatigue, mucus in my throat, chest pain, feeling of a puffy face, fast heart rate, dry mouth, insatiable thirst, intense depression, and increased heart rate. I dreamed about my ex, and I've been having dark thoughts. Is this just a sign of aging, or is something wrong with me? Nevertheless, I'm stopping alcohol and cigarettes from now on.\n\nThese symptoms occur every time i drink more then 2-3 drinks.\n\n  \nAdditional information : I go to the gym 5 times a week, 5'11. in shape etc",

            "body": "Somewhere, and medical people probably have a better idea of where the line is, I think there's a distinction between \"hangover\" and \"**withdrawal**\".\n\nWhen I stopped drinking, I did so cold turkey with no medical advice (or let's say, inadequate medical advice) and my withdrawal experience was quite _horrible_.\n\nThe first four to six days were like having a bad flu (perhaps with a touch of psychosis for extra unpleasant flavor.)  The second week was also fairly unpleasant.\n\nThere's a phenomenon called \"kindling\", or \"sedative\u2013hypnotic withdrawal\" where (as I understand it) the cycle of drink cessation followed by more drinking and cessation again tends to get worse and worse, the withdrawal gets more and more severe, and it can even become a medical emergency, i.e. it can kill when seizures and fevers come along.  I'm pretty certain that this can even happen to people who are otherwise healthy or \"in shape\".  (Could be worth a web search for your edification: \"alcohol kindling\".)\n\nThe only other thing I'll share is that I find Alcohol Free life to be just fine.  I've found there's nothing to be missed in the practice of getting intoxicated.  In fact, I'll take that a step further, I find Sober Life effing Splendid!\n\nHope that's helpful.",
