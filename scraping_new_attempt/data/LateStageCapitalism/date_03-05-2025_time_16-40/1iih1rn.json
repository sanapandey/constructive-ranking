The current global capitalist mode of production is insanely inefficient and wasteful, which is simply incompatible with a livable planet. Unfortunately, the people who benefit most from this outright insane mode of production have became unimaginably wealthy, and as such, they have extreme influence on society.\n\nThe reality is that at this rate, avoiding billions of deaths will take a global movement to dismantle capitalism. We need to reduce production, and that is simply something capitalism will never accept. We need global degrowth (especially in the Global North) and widespread rewilding.",
