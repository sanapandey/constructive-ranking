F.ex in much of Scandinavia farmers own A LOT of forest, mountains and so on from historical reasons, but they do not in any way have full private control over the land they own. They have fishing rights and the right to drive cattle or sheep in the mountains and hunting rights, but they can not block the public from roaming the land (except on fields) or harvesting mushroom and berries. They can not build whatever they want. In addition arable land have special protection, so they can\u2019t just sell their arable land to IKEA, they would have to through a looong process to reclassify that land first. Imo this works great here, but it might not work as well in a less organized society or in a society where much of the valuable land has been practically stolen by multinational corporations.",
