    "selftext": "The absolute bare bones of staying alive. I own my car outright, and pay on seasonal bulk payments for insurance, not once a month, to save some money. \n\nI share a house with a roomie and we split rent 50/50, (so actual house rent is $2050) and average rent in my area is $1849 according to Zillow. \n\nIf a living wage were tied to housing it should be $36. Instead it\u2019s $14.70 As a server I\u2019m lucky to average between $19 and $33 a shift depending on the gig and the day, and that\u2019s because I get a tipped wage. \n\nMy health insurance (plus extra for dental, and no vision coverage, I need to update my prescription) has a $7000 deductible and doesn\u2019t cover my therapy, which I can only afford for working with a private therapist. \n\nNote how there\u2019s no groceries or gas, and I still need to come up with $2328 a month. \n\nThe debt is a combination of credit card debt from my early 20s, now on a well managed debt relief program, and medical bills from when I broke my arm. \n\nIt cost too much to live here.

They have unions for labor, credit, and tenants. \n\nYou are doing everything you possibly can. The system is designed to extract as much money as it possibly can from you. Your poverty is by design. If you feel any shame from being economically insecure, please don\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault.\n\nI made a booklet as a resource for every day things that you can do to fight against the system that has left to this kind of strife.

I also don\u2019t have kids, so there\u2019s that. \n\nI\u2019m also lucky to work for small businesses than respect their employees and work with them, so I\u2019m never in fear of losing my job, or even needing to work sick. \n\nIt\u2019s just mind boggling to KNOW I\u2019m in such a better state financially than most of my American peers, and it\u2019s still sooooo bad. \n\nA Union is a great idea, I know there\u2019s server unions around the country, it\u2019s probably a great time to get involved.",
