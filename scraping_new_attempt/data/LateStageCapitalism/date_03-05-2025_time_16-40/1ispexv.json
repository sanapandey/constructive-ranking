He held on to this conception throughout his life, allowing only for one exemption: the United States. It is worth noting, though Segev does not explore this issue, that Ben-Gurion held on to this view \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that especially before World War II, antisemitism was rife within the United States. And when American antisemitism substantially diminished after the end of the war, Ben-Gurion seems to have also ignored that fact, which would have forced him to consider the role that the postwar changes in the socioeconomic conditions of the American Jewry played in it.\n\nWilliam Pelley is a good example of how the United States, while historically safe for Jews, is still not that exceptional. Had there been a coup or especially a prolonged civil war that radicalized antisemites in the interwar United States, there could\u2019ve been Europe-like pogroms or an attempted genocide of American Jews. At first glance, this would seem like a good argument for Zionism. However, I'd say that the opposite is true. If the U.S. government was unable to prevent or at least halt a genocide of Jewish Americans, how would Israel help? What good could they do at that point?\n\n>In 1950, the president of the American Jewish Committee, Jacob Blaustein, signed an agreement with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to clarify the nature of the relationship between Israel and American Jews. In the agreement, Ben-Gurion declared that American Jews were full citizens of the US and must only be loyal to it: \u201cThey owe no political allegiance to Israel.\u201d For his part, Blaustein declared that the US was not \u201cexile\u201d but rather a \u201cdiaspora\u201d and insisted that the State of Israel did not formally represent Diaspora Jews to the rest of the world. **Interestingly, Blaustein added that Israel could never be a refuge for American Jews. He emphasised that even if the US were to cease to be democratic and American Jews were to \u201clive in a world in which it would be possible to be driven by persecution from America\u201d, such a world, he insisted, contrary to Israeli claims, \u201cwould not be a safe world for Israel either\u201d.**",
