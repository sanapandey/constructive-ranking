    "selftext": "TLDR; looking to write a personal research paper on the blatant fascism that we see in the Trump administration and MAGA movement, looking for fascist acts of Trump and papers regarding the rise of fascist regimes.\n\nI have been talking to family and friends about the what we are seeing in the U.S. and how it is exactly the path that led to brutal fascist regimes. Some see the writing but others refuse to see it and say that Biden did the same. I decided that I am going to write a short research paper on the topic so condense the information and have sources all in one place.\n\nI know it\u2019s a stretch, but I was wondering if anyone has kept track of actions and statements from Trump and his administration so that I can make this as comprehensive as possible. The news cycle just goes so fast, it\u2019s so hard to keep track of everything. Also any academic/journal articles discussing the nature of fascism and the rhetoric that led to the rise of fascist regimes would be amazing. I already have some that I will work from, but could always use more.\n\nAlso if anyone is interested in the final paper, let me know and I can share. I don\u2019t get paid for this or anything, so it\u2019s not professional, but I do have a background in political science, economics, and IR, so it might still be useful for some.",

            "body": "Don\u2019t have a list, but the parallels are easily spotted. As recommended by others you need a larger scope as Biden is complicit. American empire is decaying into fascism and that\u2019s a bipartisan process, the dems were just less openly violent against their own population (unless you\u2019re speaking up for the Palestinian cause)\n\nYou might want to try the opposite approach. Through researching zionism I ended up reading about how the Nazi regime came to power and it\u2019s hard not to see parallels (especially if you include economics). Link the 2008 credit crunch to the 1929 crash and continue from there. BadEmpenada has a video (which has sources you might like) analyzing the Nazi conquest for lebensraum in eastern Europe as German colonization greatly inspired by the genocide of the native Americans, and there\u2019s a lot of colonial posturing by Trump. \n\nA nice little detail you might like is that the nazi\u2019s only build working camps (which are still concentration camps) on proper German soil and all extermination camps were on newly conquered polish ground so the german population would be less aware/exposed. Kinda like how ICE has started sending migrants to Guantomano (sp?) bay without a clear plan on how to proceed. \n\nThis last part isn\u2019t mirrored in our timeline yet, but Nazi concentration camps didn\u2019t start out as extermination camps, but were initially to, well, concentrate people to process out of the country and when you\u2019ve got them there in a camp they might as well wirk. The Haavara Agreement (another great sourced vid on YT as part 16 on a Palestine series but can\u2019t remember the channel name) was there before WW2 to guide the Jewish exodus (steering it towards Palestine, but that\u2019s another whole bucket of worms). The hate for the untermensch outgrew the pace of the emigration and plans for a final solution were drawn up.",

It is ignorant to pretend that Trump appeared in a vacuum, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I think that it\u2019s also necessary to acknowledge that authoritarianism exists on a scale and there are different forms of it. It\u2019s hard to deny that MAGA is building to fascism in a way that, to my knowledge, we have not before seen on American soil in modern history. Replacing all dissenters with loyalists, even down to the JAG corps, is pretty alarming. Idk, what are your thoughts?\n\nI know the US is a capitalist hell-scape that has inflicted countless atrocities, but right now we are at the edge of things getting a whole lot worse. I want to write this paper not to examine the course of US politics that have led us here over the last, but to show how we are not on the verge of fascism, but that fascism is here. And now we have to decide how we will respond to it, starting at the grassroots level.\n\nThe reason is because I come from a very conservative state, the people in my life will not be willing to read a 50 page communist critique of what has led us to this point, but they would be willing to read 5-10 pages of our current situation and what is terrifying about it.",

He's just bringing fascism back home when it was typically projected outwards against ''lesser'' countries and people who weren't allied with US hegemony. The US has always been a fascist settler empire spreading death and decay all around the world.\n\nAlso every state is by nature authoritarian. Conflating authoritarianism with fascism is how you end up with politically illiterate liberals who think that opposing authoritarianism is the most important virtue in existence while they keep drone bombing people in the Middle-East. If you want to measure fascism as a spectrum, then honestly, Trump is still lacking in that regard compared to his predecessor who committed a genocide.\n\nJust keep a list of the ways Trump is violating domestic and international law and pushing for reactionary, bigoted policies and legislation if you must, but I wouldn't measure it, honestly.",

Give a little benefit of the doubt instead of picking apart allies. \n\nI am aware of US atrocities, as I said in my comment that you are replying to. I am very aware that Trump is bringing home what we\u2019ve done to other countries, hence why I said \u201c on American soil.\u201d But this should still be alarming for even those that recognize the evils of the U.S. It\u2019s possible to recognize that we\u2019ve terrorized countries around the world, but that things could get far worse. \n\nPolitical dissent will be suppressed more aggressively, negative impacts from losing trade and allies will squeeze Americans tighter while also playing into the victim-complex that Americans have. They will blame outwardly more and more, causing increased aggression. Maybe it won\u2019t play out like this, I hope it doesn\u2019t, but we can\u2019t pretend like things can\u2019t descend further into madness.\n\nAs for authoritarianism and fascism. I suppose it depends on how you are defining, but typically authoritarian rule is typically considered part of a fascist regime. Again, I know the U.S. does fucking terrible things, I\u2019m not arguing Biden or past presidents aren\u2019t war criminals. But it is also worth keeping in mind that Trump has been in office for a month, so we have not seen how this will play out. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but it\u2019s not looking like Trump will end his time in office behind Biden.\n\nWith all of this stuff, I\u2019m open to being wrong, but I just ask that you\u2019re not condescending and realize that we\u2019re on the same side. And I shouldn\u2019t have to cover every possible point for that to be acceptable. Like I said, I\u2019m writing this paper for people that aren\u2019t as well-versed as you or I. People that feel things are crumbling and are scared and tired and don\u2019t know why. People that think \u201conly communists are fascists, like the nazis!\u201d So I think starting by trying to convince them that the U.S. has always been fascist on a global scale is a stretch.",

This paper is not for communists like us, it is for conservatives who are starting to see the cracks because MAGA is going mask off with fascism.

You almost certainly do not. \n\nThe amerikan regime belongs to the same owners and is not being remade. It is not our government. It is the government of the capitalist class. It is a dictatorship of the bourgeoise. Always has been and it always will be until its dying day. \n\nStrict loyalists to the capitalist dictatorship have always been in power.

Perhaps you are witnessing a newfound and paradoxical honesty in the approach to the regimes specific organization, but you are not witnessing change. \n\nP2025 is not materially different from the platform of the Biden regime, or that of any other amerikan presidents stated policy objectives. While I will give you that the regime has a newfound aesthetic bravado, I would advise against focusing on its appearance.

My suggestion is to through the various leftist news ticktock accounts like Aaron Parnas and MeidasTouch (and listen to MT podcasts.) Also sift through the account TotalHypocrisy. She hasn\u2019t been doing it quite as much recently but she has a ton of fantastic content dissecting trumps EO\u2019s, what they mean, and often how they align with Hitler. Also read the book \u201cHow Fascism Works\u201d by Jason Stanley if you haven\u2019t already. It was written during trumps first term but has reminded me of a lot of forgotten red flags from the past. I really look forward to reading your paper and thank you for doing important work.",
