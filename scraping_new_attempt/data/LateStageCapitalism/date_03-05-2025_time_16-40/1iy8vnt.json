Nor does it mean that all Muslims that do believe in it are worthless, evil and deserving of death. That is *obvious* from humanism.

Be it harm within cultural practices (as is the case with genital mutilation, as an example). Or cultural hatred and incited violence against people outside the cultural tradition (as in fascism),\n\nI do not think such practices should be tolerated. I think there is tremendous value in the Islamic tradition. Just like there's tremendous value in *all* human traditions. Wisdom is always part of the inheritance left by centuries of human civilization. However, harmful traditions have also historically been used to control sectors of populations and those permeate *all* cultures. Being selective about these practices is mandatory. \n\nAnd we're in a goddamn socialist subreddit. I don't think the western world is the be all end all of morality that does no wrong.

By phrasing things vaguely like \"being pro tolerance\" we open the way for all sorts of bigots and fascists to say reasonable sounding things and look good in the process, which then makes them more believable when they veer the conversation into bigotry. \n\nThey can do this because we, as leftists are overstating out points to absurdity. Or rather, most of this side of politics is where neoliberais and leftists agree, yet there's always a degree of performative virtue signaling on the neoliberal side that is nothing but an open wound for fascists to feast upon. \n\nThe truth is that inclusivity and tolerance aren't really the goals to strive towards, they're a simple consequence of fostering values of understanding, empathy and solidarity. Of seeing each person as the individual they are under cultural pressures beyond their control.\n\nBigots see these cultural pressures leading to harmful (or often just perverse through the lens of their own purity values) results and generalize that the entire group is harmful or perverse. However, we can't, as a response, see this cultural pressures as immutable and holy and attack all that feel ill at ease with practices that cause genuine harm as intolerant. \n\nI do not think anyone in the world is evil or irredeemable. I hate the term evil for that very reason. It is inherently myopic. However, cultures and systems are the closest we get to evil. And we can't be tolerant of those systems. Yes, that does mean being intolerant of some cultures at their most fundamental. And that's *fine*. Some aspects of cultures do not deserve to endure. \n\nThat's a hard message to swallow because it *is* close to genocidal rhetoric. Specially when you consider genocide in its less overtly violent variants of domicide and exile as opposed to mass murder. But it is also obviously true. Everyone can think of examples. Moustache man culture being an easy one. \n\nThe distinction is quite simple. There's no imperative to be the world's moral police. I think interfering in foreign cultures is pure hubris. Even if what they're doing is heinous through our cultural lens, our duty starts and ends at providing aid and refuge to those that want it. Some might see this as cruelty. But what is the alternative? World conquering? Inflicting our own moral values on everyone across the globe? \n\nHowever, within our communities certain harmful behaviors can't be tolerated, even if that means some cultures must be warped beyond recognizability or disallowed all together. But this process should be done through preventing the harmful behaviours themselves, not through culturally motivated prosecution.",
