Why are literal fucking Nazis becoming a protected class in AMERICA, a country that helped KILL them.\n\n\n- *Elon sieg heils at inauguration.*\n\n- *Multiple Nazi rallies protected by cops.*\n\n- *Kanye legally selling swastika merch through Yeezy.*\n\n- *Elon backs the AfD, a literal neo-nazi organization.*\n\n- *Trump says to 'prioritize' South American and European immigrants (whites).*\n\n- *DOGE re-hiring a self-proclaimed racist and white supremicist.*\n\n- *Literally banning books (churches burning some).*\n\n- *Kanye fulling coming out as a true, literal Nazi.*\n\n- *The biggest social media site strictly promotes hate-speech and Nazi propaganda.*\n\n- *Meta, Amazon, Twitter, Reddit all bowing down to an authoritarian regime in exchange for special treatment.*\n\nHow are we normalizing this!? How, over the course of 8 years, did we go from \"the Nazi party was a ruthless, horrible regime and should be exterminated\" to \"actually let's hear them out\"!!?? \n\nI am losing my MIND. Why are we okay with this!? How have we fostered a society that allows these couch-fucking troglodytes to feel safe enough to show their bastard asses? How did we embolden them so thoroughly?????\n\nI just realized today one of my co-workers has a fucking swastika tattooed on his finger. I need to find a way to report him but my company doesn't have HR or anything like that. How are you allowed to have a job at a place that employees all walks of life when you openly state you despise half of them?\n\nWHAT ARE WE DOING!?",

Such as the [CIA black sites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/09/cia-torture-black-site-enhanced-interrogation) spread around the world where people are kidnapped to and tortured.\n\nThere was a study by Lars Schoultz in 1981 that found that US aid to Latin American countries was diametrically opposite to their human rights record. The worst violators of human rights received the most aid. The study adjusted for population size and per capita aid, and found that there was no correlation between poverty and need for aid, and the amount of US aid. Just torture. The exact same thing applies today in the Middle East\n\nReally none of this should be a surprise to anyone informed or politically aware over the last few decades",

They made sure they were constitutional; they were created by a group of AG\u2019s.  These NAZIs thought American race law was \u201cunfair\u201d and illogical.  After passing these laws they partied in NY with American AGs.  They asked why our laws were so random; answer by the America First AGs; it\u2019s by design and leaves a lot of wiggle room. (Hitlers American Model).  \n\nEven the Nuremburg laws were done in accordance with their constitution.  The Final Solution was not.   \n\nThe Nazis didn\u2019t become the modern boogey man they are today until 1939.  During a Nazi documentary; Germans were asked about Hitler\u2019s policies.  One said; had he died in 1938 he would have been a National Hero.  Don\u2019t forget the world glad handing him during the 36\u2019 Olympics.  \n\nSo calling someone a Nazi doesn\u2019t have to imply they are murderers.  Lots of variations in the Nazi regime.",

No it\u2019s not social awkwardness, no it\u2019s not ignorance, it\u2019s Nazism, period. Pick an ideology and stick to it\u2014just like I knew someone who thought Biden was incompetent and old and not mentally present and at the same time thought that he was evidently some strategic mastermind planning \u201cThe War\u201d to start within the United States. Like\u2026 no. Call these people out when they contradict themselves. Demonstrate to them that their assumptions don\u2019t track with one another. He is either a \u201cbrilliant\u201d Nazi or an INCREDIBLY sheltered moron, which would obviously mean he has no gaddam business in Washington but guess what? He is there so, guess what that means. 1+1=\ud83e\udd74\n\nTo be clear I don\u2019t think he is brilliant, I think he is a con. Anybody with that amount of money or even close to that is, why? Because no one individual needs that amount of money to survive, that money didn\u2019t come out of thin air, these assholes did not earn it on their own, they COULD NOT attain this amount of money without us, and here is this collosal asshat \u201csaving us from fraud\u201d by stripping us billions of dollars of funding\u2014which people need because these assholes hoard the wealth and hardly anybody can get ahead anymore\u2014while not discussing where is it going and sitting atop his 418 billion dollar stack. That is ($999,000,000 + $1,000,000) x 418 = $418,000,000,000.00\n\nImagine the difference he could make in the world with what he already has. But guess what? He hasn\u2019t. If anyone expects that to suddenly change now, they ain\u2019t they brightest crayons in the box. Much like Trump, all his philanthropic work basically funnels money back to himself. These guys are parasites. Anyways, /vent I guess\n\n\nEdit:  I want to add an fyi for everybody even though many probably already know, most of the major journalistic news outlets are owned by these people. Expect the \u201cpolls\u201d and \u201cacceptance/approval ratings\u201d to somehow be more favorable and higher (as I have seen already) than what you know people are really feeling. They can scratch each others\u2019 backs, and if they run into some outsider with a bit of integrity, what\u2019s a million bucks to fudge some numbers? Not much when you have 418,000 of them. All of our media is at risk of devolving into Russia 2.0, but for now they know that they have to keep it somewhere diversified because they know that as least the other half of us that reads isn\u2019t braindead. /vent, the sequel",

                    "body": "It\u2019s absolutely wild to watch people all wake up like this in real time. \n\nI was a sophomore in college when Trump won in 2016, and had been huge into Bernie since high school (with merch and everything). I saw everything playing out exactly as it is now\u2014 I had to change anxiety medications several times in college and stopped weed for 2+ years after Kavanaugh was confirmed.  I kept having doomer spirals about the State and Future of the World every time I was stoned, especially re: climate crisis. \n\nSince then, I watched small encouraging victories become increasingly small in the sea of bullshit, for example:\nI was in the room with Ilhan when she was first sworn in as a state rep, worked on a campaign against Jacob Frey the first time he ran, several of my closest friends were wrongfully arrested at MN pipeline protests (including a planted DUI), my parents wouldn\u2019t talk to me for months because of my participation in the George Floyd riots and mutual aid (when I worked in the same small office as my mom), and in grad school became a victim of red state abortion restrictions and had to get a DNC out of state. \n\nI\u2019ve very viscerally seen and felt everything literally become the nightmares that felt ridiculous in college, right down to becoming a drop in the bucket of horrifying abortion statistics. And I\u2019m an ecologist, so the suite of environmental issues we\u2019re dealing with is at the forefront of my waking mind all day every day. \n\nI have long thought that me and my friends are just over idealistic young people experiencing the timeless coming of age anxiety that every generation has experienced before us. I thought that if it was really that bad, sensible adults with a sense of duty would be ringing the alarm when the writing was on the wall. But that didn\u2019t happen, the post-9/11 neoliberal dream of the 90s has a gorilla grip on Gen X and they couldn\u2019t see past the rose glass to see that institutions and rules we have taken for granted can and will disappear in their lifetimes. \n\nTrump has been on all 3 presidential ballots I\u2019ve ever cast, and not one of those times have I had faith in the candidate I voted for. My entire adulthood has been watching a promised world be dismantled piece by piece\u2014 like rubbernecking an apocalypse. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised people are freaking out en masse only now, but I am still disturbed by it. It\u2019s very telling group behavior\u2014 people pay very little attention or care to issues that don\u2019t directly offend them. Our culture\u2019s selfishness and individualism has intellectually isolated people\u2014 not just social media and regressive working conditions running our humanity raw, but an opt-in bubble effect where people literally choose ignorance as bliss. \n\nThe monoculture was dead or at least dying until now.  people are disoriented being ripped out of those bubbles and plopped back into a universal reality where we let fascism out of the bottle to poison the entire USA. All of this SHOULD be a vicious wake up call to the people glued to CSPAN or CBN who have been complaining about Bernie bros, protest voters, or Hillary\u2019s emails for several years. They\u2019re understanding, finally, what they refused to take at face value with their own eyeballs when they had a chance to nip it in the bud.\n\nWe are going to be seeing a LOT of cognitive dissonance, dunning Kruger, strawman etc etc etc shit across the political spectrum throughout the near future. People who are in denial (it wasn\u2019t a Nazi salute), are naive (they can\u2019t just ignore a judge\u2019s rule), stupid (project 2025 isn\u2019t real), opportunistic (grifters), and diabolical (magas et al.) are going to be saying a lot of out of pocket shit while we collectively spin out as a culture. If we can anticipate this, we can rise above it with patience, clarity, resolve, grit, courage, and a righteous belief in a better (and possible) future. \n\nThis comment is not any kind of call to arms or specific sentiment, just a brain dump of how I\u2019ve been processing the hilarity that has ensued in the last few weeks and months.",

America has always been a very troubled country - able to produce many good and wondrous things, certainly, but ultimately vulnerable to corruption so unabated that it leads to total collapse from the inside. That's where we are now.\n\nAs a Canadian, I've been an America hater for years now, and it's nice to finally not be so alone on that.

Instead of opting for socialist policies to resolve the contradictions in our society, we opt for fascism which has the state come in to reinforce the privatization further.\n\nThen liberals are so captured by their need to capitulate to capital lest they sacrifice whatever modicum of power they have in society. This leads them to end up siding WITH fascists over stopping them because while they would love for the status quo to return and for people to have ostensible freedoms, but not if that means doing away with capitalism and the structures it informs.\n\nThis is why the Democratic party seems so useless right now. They are inherently the other side of the capitalist owning class. As has become very clear in recent weeks they are unwilling to fight back because they do not ideologically disagree with what's happening, they just disagree with the optics of how its happening. If they disagreed they would be fighting back vociferously and obstructing these evil motherfuckers not voting with Republicans to confirm Nazis to cabinet positions or working with Republican majorities on bills targeting at risk populations.\n\nAnd I'll add this isn't just a US problem. It seems all liberal democracies are struggling with this. Capital has consolidated too much and the rich have an outsized influence that globally the liberal powers that be are unwilling to deal with. And if you are in a country it hasn't made it to yet rest assured its coming for you too unless we can form some global movement founded in solidarity with all members of the working class. Liberation must come for all before any of us are truly free.",

I do not understand the people who are just starting to freak out now.\n\nI do. It's largely because the United States doesn't teach this history in fear of the public getting out of line and challenging the power structure of the wealthy elite which corrupt the United States. If they accurately taught history to everyone including it's own daily media about their past corruption, it would lead into an explosion of government distrust, societal dissalusionment, rebellions, murders targetted at government members, wealthy elite, and corporation magnates whom orchastrated those wars.\n\nPeople in every generation will ask similar questions to this because their is no monetary incentive for corporations to teach it if they ever want to use facism and ultranationalism as a weapon to destroy communism or any other system that equals out the playing field.\n\nWhy else do you think the billionaires in this country want education privatized. For the simple reason that it is beneficial to keep society unaware, complacent, or what they really want, eager to support the facist mechanism that holds them in their respective classes. Then through propaganda, demonize awareness and education as wrong and backward, and label ideas and words that had connotations with proper education as bad like they did with redefining the word woke from awareness of social and systemic issues to being anything that I dislike.\n\nIt's easier for the billionaires to lie and enable more lies if the populace is kept stupid and unable to critically think for themselves. Plus, do to the enormous amounts of capital that they have at their disposal, they can buy news networks, social media websites, advertisements, music record labels, sports teams, and every other mechanism of entertainment they can use to manufacture public influence and consent.",

It isn't. There are multiple elections.\n\n* Federal presidential year elections every 4 years\n* Federal congressional elections (midterms) every 2 years\n* State elections\n* Local elections\n\nAlso each one of these 4 elections also has a primary election as well as a general election.\n\nIn the federal presidential election, turnout may be 60%. The turnout in the federal congressional elections may only be 40%. Turnout in state and local elections can be closer to 20-30. Turnouts in primaries can be as low at 10%.\n\nTake AOC. She is the representative from NY-14 district. She ran a primary against Joe Crowley, who was an establishment democrat. AOC won the primary with 17k votes, vs Crowley who got 13k votes.\n\nShe then won the midterm general election with 110k votes. The population of NY-14 is 740k people.\n\nThat means that 2% of the population of NY-14 (more like 3% of the voting eligible population) voted to make AOC their representative in the primary. As a result, now we have AOC instead of an establishment democrat who would probably be less willing to fight for people.\n\nIf you really want to have an impact on America, vote in every election. Vote in the federal presidential, the federal midterm, state and local elections. And vote in both the primaries and the general elections.\n\nDoing these things will take you about \\~30 minutes of effort a year (since you'll end up voting 1-2 times a year, every year, instead of only voting once every 4 years), but will make you the most influential 10% of voters. When I vote in local or state elections, or when I vote in primaries, there is never a line. I drive to my polling place that is 1 minute away, vote and go home. The entire process takes me about 5 minutes. \n\nStates and local officials are working to resist Trump. Congressional democrats are working to resist Trump. These people are decided by primaries, local and state elections as well as federal midterm elections.",

To also reference your clearly recent favorite author, FDR himself had to appease the radical left wing of America with his own policies just to keep communism \u201cat bay.\u201d  In that regard, the historians aren\u2019t wrong.\n\nSo far as contextualizing the (downfall of) democracy starting from the 80s - that\u2019s exactly when government began its steepest decline towards authoritarianism. The Mafia was legalized when loansharking became the legal lending policy of America. The closing of asylums nationwide then allowed the most dangerous in society to walk among us freely AND VOTE. Then to make matters even worse, began seeding the idea that government bureaucracy had expanded beyond control and targeted critical environmental agencies and regulations that were born FROM the 60s and 70s and Carters time.  \n\n\nI will spare everyone a longer list, but democracy was on an upward path with the enfranchisement of black and women voters.

The Holocaust wasn\u2019t even a priority until late in the war.  \n\n- Post-war, everyone hired Nazis. The US (Operation Paperclip) and USSR recruited Nazi scientists/spies for tech and intel. West Germany rehired Nazi bureaucrats to rebuild.  \n\n- Hypocrisy alert: The Allies fought \"Nazi racism\" while practicing segregation (Jim Crow), colonialism, or supporting authoritarian regimes post-war if they were anti-communist.  \n\n- The \"moral crusade\" narrative is mostly retroactive. Churchill low-key admired fascism, America had Nazi sympathizers, and even some Zionist groups made deals with Nazis pre-war.  \n\nConclusion: The Allies did stop Nazism, but the fight was driven by power, not purity. Recognizing this complexity matters today\u2014it reminds us that fighting fascism requires confronting all systemic hate, not just performative gestures.",

A lot of comments here are talking about how hopeless the situation is because we here in the US don't have a unified left, we don't have a united party. It's only hopeless if you believe it is. I believe one real issue is that those with extra time in their days (perhaps some people on this thread) spend it consuming and placating themselves; I certainly am not above this, and am trying with all of my might to break free of habits that placate me or trick me into ignorance. I think people with time and privilege need to be making meaningful contact with the workers and people who are the most exploited in the country \u2013 we are disconnected from the folks who make everything in this country happen. This is our struggle, all of us together. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can be effective.\n\nI have some thoughts. I have been cleaning up trash with a friend of mine twice a week, doing no-barrier food giveaways (cook cheap food with friends, give out at bus hubs) and film screenings (if you have a space, all you need is a flyer). It's incredible how friendly everyone is at all of these events (or just on the street while picking up trash); I've met some incredible people and expanded my community considerably. I've also been going to local organization meetings, such as Foodnotbombs, and my local sunrise movement hub. Even thought I don't agree 100% with their politics, I think it's really valuable to see how these groups organize and to meet people who are active and dedicated to a cause.\n\nI'm still very new in my political and historical education, but I've found it incredibly inspiring to watch documentaries and read books on past revolutionary movements \u2013 an important thing to remember is that those past movements \"failed\", but they also SUCCEEDED if we can learn from their mistakes and their downfalls. This revolution, our revolution, the ongoing revolution is special because it is impossible without mistakes; we just have to use them and learn from them. For example, using the brutal infiltration and repression of the Black Panthers as a tool for self-radicalization and a way of identifying the enemy (capitalism, state repression) while at the same time realizing that their free breakfast program was a godsend for many people too busy and oppressed to become politically literate \u2013 helping people meet their basic needs is an incredible form of organizing.\n\nAlso, [it's important to realize the difference between mobilizing and organizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZXePR6tBPk). We've been mobilizing, when we really need to be organizing our local communities(just not with state-sponsored unions) and helping folks build class consciousness.\n\nAbove all, **we need to truly love our neighbors and friends through action**. Having a \"goal\" or \"ideology\" is complete useless if no action is taken. Importantly: **anything is better than nothing**. Seriously \u2013 MLK said \"analysis is paralysis\" and he's right. \"act into thinking\" is another one that I like. Collaboratively doing small things builds communities and relationships. Call up a friend and cook a meal for someone. Start a book club about revolutionary history. Be curious. Get sober. This is the time.\n\nThere are many starting points in terms of history, but I recommend reading A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn. It's not perfect, but it changed my life and my view on American Politics.\n\nCurious to hear what y'all have to say.",

This is such a polarizing issue. Nazis hate Jews. Jews hate Palestinians. Palestinians hate Jews. People who sympathize with Palestine are now more open to sympathizing with Nazi rhetoric instead of being completely and morally closed off to the possibility. \n\nSo since the \u201cLiberals\u201d protest Israel blowing up Gaza, the \u201cConservatives\u201d choose the polar opposite choice which is allying with Israel except some get lost along the way because of Twitter and YouTube because\u2026.\n\n2. Hitlers speeches have been translated to English with AI. I have a fucked up story about this. I was playing games with my friends not paying attention to what was playing in the background and I heard what sounded like an old time style microphone and the popping and static of a phonograph. I tuned in to listen for a second and heard someone speaking about \u201ctaking our country back\u201d \u201cthe media being evil\u201d \u201cmorality is crumbling and it\u2019s up to us to preserve our culture\u201d. \n\nSo I\u2019m thinking to myself. \u201cI wonder if this is Truman or some old Timey president I\u2019ve never actually listened to. I Kinda like what I\u2019m hearing.\u201d \n\nSure e-fucking-nough I had been listening to a soft spoken Adolph Hitler in clear English with no accent for like 15 minutes just vibing and thinking it was JFK or something. I was appalled when I realized. It was too relatable to what is happening in the world right now. I know when I hear an Angry German man screaming things I can\u2019t understand that it\u2019s Hitler most likely and to be on my way but I was caught completely off guard and I felt disgusted in myself. \n\nI think there are lots of people coming across his speeches organically and attempting to understand and identify with what he says because it\u2019s out of context to know how to move past it and understand that these speeches were the reasons millions of people died. \n\nTo answer your question. How did we get to this point? Technology and the free dissemination of ideals. Considering our education system hasn\u2019t been worth a shit for so long (now it\u2019s shut down so fuck us right?) and has been underfunded, people just don\u2019t have the education to contribute to society In meaningful ways.  You have angry virgins all over the place that can\u2019t \u201clooksmax\u201d because they\u2019re diet is fucked and they can\u2019t get out from behind a keyboard and stop being a warrior for 5 mins to exercise. So they stew in this hatred and misinformation for hours and hours and eventually start spreading ideas like \u201cHitler was such a kind sounding person\u201d in forums. \n\nThere are probably other ways to look at it but this is just my personal observation so please take it easy on me.",

Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to\u2014to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\nBut the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u201cGerman Firm\u201d stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nAnd one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u201cJewish swine,\u201d collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays.\n\nBut the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\nSuddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven\u2019t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.\u201d\nEdit: syntax",

Frank Zappa was saying in like the 80's that he could see the United States going down the road of a fascist theocracy. You had writers such as Parenti and Chomsky in '86 and '88 respectively published *Inventing Reality* and *Manufacturing Consent*. Media manipulation with a right wing bias.\n\nI remember, just personally, in like 2015 or 2016 a professor introducing political philosophy to us and talking about how Canada and the United States are infinitely closer to falling into fascism than socialism or communism. As a 19 or 20 year old then I thought he was speaking nonsense. But every year since then I have seen that he was more and more correct.\n\nOur current political landscape was not created overnight. It took decades of the right undermining democratic institutions and just flat out lying to the public. The liberals here in North America didn't drop the ball, they allowed this to happen either happily or through gritted teeth. Regardless, they didn't put up a fight. There has been no serious left wing group with their hands on the reigns of political power here in NA since the 80's at least.",

Which manifests as police protecting the KKK and neo Nazis right to assemble and march. This is the very definiton of stupid dumb retarted crap that will start the cycle all over again. \n\nI think this is a mistake, the logic is that no one has the right to decide what is a bad idea in the market of ideas, which is bullshit, there are cases so extreme such as Nazism that an entire planet went to war and pretty much settled on the agreement that this is a bad idea and cannot be allowed. For FFs Capitalis and Communism allied with each other to defeat it in the greatest war ever. Is that not enough to prove to all this crap cannot be tolerated. \n\nLo and befold a few generations later of allowing those ideas to grow unchecked we are now seeing the rise of it around the world.",

For decades it's been impossible to avoid the narrative that tech and its creators, those vaunted silicon valley Geniuses, are gods and should be allowed to control society - that the imperatives of Innovation and Growth should come before that antiquated idea of the Public Interest.

They fly lame flags and hold up little signs to rally and inspire their brand of stupidity. They hide their faces in fear and shame, believing their anonymity to be even more \"white\" power.

Any power they have they channel into promoting faith in ideas that most people don't want and that cannot prevail because they're stupid and impractical, let alone immoral or evil. \n\nThese \"conservatives\" just need a nickname that encapsulates the weakness they don't realize they are championing. Swasticucks comes to mind. They hate \"cuck\" and spend way too much time thinking about being cucked as an entire race and gender. That's where their grievance lies, and they don't realize their cuckdom is what they broadcast with their imagery and their rhetoric.

Every politician is guilty of this, not once did anyone stand up against this policy, and they Congress defended it while perpetuating the crisis through the media. Alcohol kills more people every year than any known drug to man. If not for the war on drugs how much gang, cartel, violence, or terrorism would be in the world today. \n\nIf the War on Drugs was never about stopping drugs, then what was its real purpose? How far would the U.S. government go to maintain control over Black and Latino communities while protecting white superiority? Trillions of dollars spent, entire neighborhoods turned into police war zones, families torn apart, and a prison system designed to profit off human lives was this really about public safety, or was it about ensuring that power and privilege stayed exactly where they\u2019ve always been?

The US Treasury Department, along with American banks like JP Morgan & Co., Chase, and Citibank, loaned large sums of money to rebuild Germany after WWI. JP Morgan, Chase, Citibank, and many other institutions continued funding and laundering money for Germany from 1933 until the US \"officially\" entered the war in 1941, following the Pearl Harbor attack. After Pearl Harbor, the US declared war on Japan. The US had colonized the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, and they spent the next three years there before joining forces with the rest of the Allies in Europe.\n\nThe United States was the last to arrive. By the time they did, the Soviet Union had already pushed the Nazis to the brink of defeat on the Eastern front, and they likely would have defeated them outright without the US. That\u2019s exactly why the US waited so long to join. The real enemy for the US was the Soviet Union. Communism (socialism) posed the biggest threat to American capitalism, and the US entered the war to protect their global interests and stop the Soviets from liberating Europe and spreading socialism across Europe and Japan. Japan actually reached out to the Soviet Union to surrender three months before the US dropped the atomic bombs. The US had no intention of a peaceful resolution. They wanted Japan for strategic purposes. The Soviets declared war on Japan, and the United States dropped the bombs as the first act of the Cold War.\n\nNext, we move on to the Nazis in America. The US pardoned 1,600 Nazis through Operation Paperclip. The US needed their expertise for NASA, biological warfare development, and other nefarious activities. The US also played a significant role in the Nuremberg Trials, deciding who would be prosecuted and who would be pardoned for their Cold War expertise. But the Nazi party\u2019s influence didn\u2019t stop there. They played a huge role in the development of the Apollo space program, as well as mustard and sarin gas for the US military. They even conducted human experimentation and developed numerous weapons, including bombs, that the US put to use. So in answer to your question I think the US is doing what it always has done.",
