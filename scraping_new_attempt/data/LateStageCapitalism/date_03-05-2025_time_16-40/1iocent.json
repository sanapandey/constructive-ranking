One in six Americans has [unpaid medical debt on their credit report.](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0349) [50% of all Americans](https://news.gallup.com/poll/317948/fear-bankruptcy-due-major-health-event.aspx) fear bankruptcy due to a major health event. [Tens of thousands](https://pnhp.org/news/lack-of-insurance-to-blame-for-almost-45000-deaths-study/) of Americans [die every year](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Fact-Sheet_Medicare-for-All-2023.pdf) for [lack of affordable  healthcare](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323087/). \n\nWith healthcare spending [expected to increase](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nhe-projections-forecast-summary.pdf) from an already unsustainable $15,705 in 2025, to an absolutely catastrophic $21,927 by 2032 (with no signs of slowing down), things are only going to get much worse. \n\nSo the way I kind of see it playing out is healthcare as a political issue starting to reach critical mass for the 2032 election. Unfortunately the healthcare industry is the most powerful lobbying force in the country, and incredibly adept at propaganda. This will lead to politicians paying lip service to healthcare and blowing smoke up our asses; making trivial changes that won't have any significant impact. There is only so much you can do to make people work against their own interests as they increasingly see friends and loved ones suffering and dying in ever growing numbers.\n\nIt will take another 8-12 years for it to become obvious to even the most desperate of those among us to deep throat the propaganda that those actions don't work, and then another 4-8 years to actually get something implemented. \n\nSo.... somewhere between 2044 and 2052 we'll finally have hopefully meaningful reform implemented. I'm 52 now, and it's one of my life goals to see universal healthcare before I die. But we'll see.",

            "body": "For capitalist society we lack competition in health insurance. Which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Google says we 900 health insurance companies. But most health insurance companies own about 16 or more smaller health insurance companies. While others are state selective or job selective. For example one federal insurance plan called GEHA has a biweekly premium of $80 biweekly deductible with $ 350 annual in network deductible for individual health insurance with 6.5k out of pocket which less than 2.5 million have. While i got priority health owned BHSH and what's this back the card CIGNA. I pay $275 premium per paystub, with $1,300 deductible  in network , 6.5k out of pocket on family plan.(Single plan is half). My plan from last year was priority health  was i think $100 biweekly premium with $3200 deductible and 10 k out pocket in network family plan. When i had united healthcare i shit not exact same plan amounts. So Cigna owns Anetem thats now Elevated healthcare, that also owns alot Bluecross. And all these plan were the exact same prices when i had UnitedHealth care through work. \n\nSo really if want play numbers game. I figured out no-matter you get HMO or PPO  or POS its all shit. Because the f price difference between all them is $75. Because the annual premium plus deductible are all close same amount. I pay 8-10k a year on health cost with insurance i never reach my deductible because im an employee for nonprofit Hosptial group (beaumont not saying CH) that own for profit priority health. And all our hostpital group faccilties and doctors are supposed be inetwork. That what they are listed on Health insurance site . But they don't operate at Beaumont facility, even though they have a Beaumont office.they go to different private hostpial for surgery, that all ANES are outsourced and Tier 1. And you want look at how many people have close same health insurance optiion as i did. Thats  100M for Anetem, 115M for sister company. 45M for United healthcare (that still have the cards there same options).  That 250 million covered out the 300 million covered by health insurance. Which includes other plans like medicaid/ medicare in these plans, that gov helps pay for the cost. But it's still insane that  83 percent the health insurance is controlled by  2 extremely similar parent companies.\n\nWhen comes down to it . Insurances make their own rules, like 1 year deductibles rather than long term service. They don't have compete with 100s of very small field health insurances because most people don't qualify for health insurance outside the Top 5 parent companies. Which are $100-200 total different from each other but non are affordable. State insurance/assisted insurance plans are pretty b.s too because its got limit of support too many people, so you end up in hole, as if you had no insurance. Then the insurance penalties was bullshit. \n\nWe' re fed to believe it  is a market but just oligopoly with subsidized health insurance that takes advantage of us, we pay for to try lower the cost of healthcare that also takes advantage of us, and pay our government that also takes advantage of us, in effort to pay for said health insurance that we also couldn't afford.",
