The natural response that all of us should have is to violently **DEFEND** ourselves from our attackers. What I'm trying to say, is that a lot of people are scared/angry and they're going to express their feelings (threats of violence) verbally online.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that violent rhetoric is **NECESSARY** because democracy is under attack; this is not an exaggeration. The moderators of Reddit (and other websites) are failing us when they ban violent rhetoric; they are intentionally (or unintentionally) aiding a fascist takeover of the US. I think everyone should be spreading the John F. Kennedy and Thomas Jefferson quotes.",

To add to this terrifying shitpile, that also means they bypassed all security clearance requirements, while going mobster on the country's top agencies that contain a mountain of personal citizen information that they can basically guaranteed is verified and reasonably accurate.

                    "body": "There are a lot of people who have written good, well researched comments on this with sources. I'm on mobile and a Day 1 target of P2025 and the current regime, working a fucking stressful job, so... You can look for the sources if you'd like, but I'm still going to try to answer in good faith and I do have a polisci degree. \n\nThere's so much working against us. One of the things you have to understand is that the US is huge, decentralized, and has no major public transit connecting any of us. France is the size of like four large states and everyone is within a few hours of Paris. \n\nBut that's not the only problem. The Republicans have been working on this for ages. Literally decades ago, they started focusing on local elections which pushed in bad faith towards gerrymandering and stacking the lower courts. This means that local stuff basically can't be fixed the intended legal way. I live in Ohio and we're held hostage to the Republican party because of how bad it is here. They keep trying to (and sometimes do) overturn actual voter lead initiatives that passed because they think the voters are too stupid to do anything about it and we have no way to get them out. After they stacked the courts, billionaires managed to get Citizens United passed which basically said corporations are people which eventually lead to a huge influx of special interest money into politics AND congressional officials are tacitly allowed to trade stocks even though insider trading is illegal, even the left has gotten rich off these two things. \n\nSo you have two parties, beholden to the donor class, not the people. There's a lot between where that starts and now, but this comment is already a wall of text. The short of it is they started quietly pretending to be divided while working on corporate interests. This has spiraled since Reagan who also did a ton of damage in his terms. \n\nSome of these corporate interests realized the push for people to go to college, y'know, taught them things - political or science things that contradict what they want us to believe. So they started defunding education, warping media outlets to their message, and smarter people focus on careers so they have less children, meaning the less educated start outpacing the smarter people. This has been going on for a while.\n\nTrump in 2016 was a dry run. The guardrails didn't hold because he stacked the supreme court. He ended up fomenting an insurrection and half the country cheered it on and pretended like it didn't happen. Now you have him saying Fox News is too liberal and his supporters go even further right where none of them are being told the truth. My wife's parents watch OAN and I know how bad it gets. \n\nHe wasn't held accountable for anything in his first term and they spent years working with very alt right Christian fascists (Heritage Foundation) to craft an agenda for the next term. And now they're doing it. And they're doing it so fucking fast and furious that no one can keep up with all of it at once. Half the country is cheering it on because they don't know better and at least another quarter is denying it's as bad as it is and \"surely our system will weather the storm\". It's not going to. They want a fire sale like the end of the Soviet Union. \n\nTrump wants to be Xi or Putin, unchallenged ruling over Les Miserables. Who the hell knows what coked out Elmo wants besides more money and power, but he's the one that really worries me. But even IF we could try to hold them accountable, the Supreme Court already said he can do whatever he wants and Congress has no interest in stopping him if they get rich off it. Almost every congress person is a millionaire.\n\nSo now you've got a quarter of the population at most who agrees how bad this looks and thinks it can't work itself out legally / end well, but spread across a country similar in size to Europe and less densely populated with limited avenues to get to each other, especially the capitol, and the state trying to consolidate control over information (which it was already doing well at).",
