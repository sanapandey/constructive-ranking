Especially towards the end of the war, German Conscripts were almost exclusively teenagers, senior citizens or men already crippled from birth or from battle from battle, forced to go back as long as they can hold a rifle up long enough to fire a round\u2026. so I\u2019m not going to hold that against them as I view them as also being victims of the Reich and I say this as someone whose relatives survived the camps, so I hope no one thinks I\u2019m spouting the \u201cclean Wehrmacht\u201d myth, I\u2019m certainly not, *but* it is very important for people to know the difference because otherwise NeoNazis will lump the SS psychopath volunteers in the same group as the *Volkssturm* made up of elementary aged boys and men in their 60s who were told \u201cEither fight, or be shot right here where you stand\u201dand try to use that as a way to whitewash and revise the role of the SS. I feel that due to most people not knowing the distinction between the SS as 100% volunteer entity and the Wehrmacht being a mix of forced conscripts and also Nazi fanatics, is why the \u201cjust following orders\u201d argument is still breathing. Because neonazis still spread the lie that SS members were simply soldiers doing their job. Nah, fuck that noise. It\u2019s not only volunteer but you also had to beat dozens of other candidates all trying to prove that they\u2019re the most loyal Nazi. These evil fucks *grinded* for their place in the SS\u2026.\n\nTL,DR *anyone* who joined the SS quite literally volunteered for a place reserved in hell. Rest in stale two week old piss to all SS.",
