And it is the mains stream vision of capitalism and liberalism nowadays, anything else is considered \"socialism\" or an utopia.\n\nThe first theoretical liberalism never existed in practice, just as comunism never did.\n\nThe main difference is that you can't never assure the \"true liberalism\" in a capitalism system, because private wealth production will always lead to assymetrical relations of power in political representation. But with no private property you have better odds to achieve those goals. For example, you can take a look at the background of USSR leaders and USA leaders, one nation is/was led by oligarchs and the other nation was led by sons of workers and farmers.",

In China, land reform made the countryside more equal, and general welfare was included in public planning.  India, despite hollow socialist rhetoric, was more \"gradual\", giving liberal rights to all (ie right to vote), but without tweaking land tenure or property relations (ie who gets paid).  The results?  China eliminated chronic poverty - and the associated high death rate - much faster than India, since day one.  In 1989, economists Sen and Dreze found that:\n\n>Every eight years or so more people die in India because of its higher regular death rate than died in China in the gigantic famine of 1958-1961.  India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame. (\"Hunger and Public Action\" (1989), pg 214-215)\n\nSpecifically, even on top of the enormous Great Leap Forward (GLF) catastrophe (killing 15-35m), this excess death rate translated to a relative death toll in India [of **130-145m**](https://strikewire.xyz/India-vs-China-vitalities.png) according to UN data from 1950-2021; according to Western demographers\u2019s [data](https://strikewire.xyz/china-v-india-raw-data.png), the toll is near **300m** (35-50m and 140m by 1980, respectively).\n\nWhile Mao\u2019s failures are often ahistorically focused on (and inflated), the hidden price of a gradual, liberal-inspired approach tower above.  Why does this basic fact remain so unknown?  See my article [here](https://strikewire.xyz/Wu4AE.html) for more (explanation, methods, sources, etc).\n\nThis is one of my copypastas - some topics come up repeatedly, and like to have relevant material on hand.

Amazon pulling a walmart, destroying small business as a loss leader till the local businesses close down. Now streaming services have paid ad models because people are too comfortable with the remaining options they know they have us by the balls. Amazon raised the price of prime and does dynamic pricing (use an extension to check price history). All this while unable to lower internet prices, improve quality, or improve public transportation.\n\n\nYou can talk about how tariffs prevent you from buying or maintaining better cheaper Chinese EV's than Musk's EV company.\n\n\nHow due to no regulations business owners moved factories and jobs out of the US.",

Communism is more a shift in human zeitgeist than simply economics.\n\nJust because a country calls themselves communist does not mean that it's true.

There are aspects of socialism in this system. Any communist system need not be perfect either. What 'working' means is also completely contextual. Does capitalism 'work'?
