Trump's Department of Injustice got the charges dropped without prejudice, then Tom Homan finished threatening him publicly that if he wasn't 100% compliant with whatever Trump wants to do in NYC, the charges will come back.\n\nThis is likely a preview of things to come. Pam Bondi inherited the corruption investigation Biden's administration had going, but she can \"invent charges\" against any other official that doesn't fall into line. \n\nThere's something like 60,000 federal crimes. So she can pretty much just watch them and take her pick.",

The cannot actually plan or have foresight; they can only understand how to grow faster and opress others because that is all they were told how to do, and now it is a vice, for of they stop now, they would get destroyed by the huge pressure they had put themselves in.\n\nWhy they ended up like this?, because competitive pressure had eliminated the ones that would rather have self preservation above capital growth. That is why so many of the founders of this big companies are now out of them, because they are cautious and careful, while the current management is vicious. That is also why these big companies would inevitably fail, by their own hand, and the next golden boy enterprise that replaces them will be then subjected to the same presures.\n\nThis will never end until we tame and harness competitiveness itself instead of debating if competition is or not good with the capitalism vs communism debate. Cooperation is better than competition for stability, but stability is stagnation an that is just deadlier in the long long term, while pure competition will inevitably favor the suicidal for success. Only by adresding this issues can anything change forma the better.",
