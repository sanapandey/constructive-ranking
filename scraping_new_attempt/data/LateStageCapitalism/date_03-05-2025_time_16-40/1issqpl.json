The change of survival are significantly higher than they were during Sankara's presidency. Africa and the rest of the Global South will eventually liberate itself from their colonial and imperialist oppressors, hopefully by means of communist revolutions and coups. I just hope it's going to accelerate at a pace that makes it impossible for the US empire to rely on contingency plans and compartmentalize funds and special ops in an effective manner because the spread of revolution fervor is too much to handle.",
