As in, I\u2019ve got enough savings to maybe cover the absurd out of pocket expenses that would come with trying to utilize my health insurance depending upon the condition.  And I realize that I\u2019m probably a lot better off than most Americans in that regard.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely disgraceful.  We are living in a failed state.  This should be one of the most basic benchmarks of how well a government functions and we have failed entirely.",
