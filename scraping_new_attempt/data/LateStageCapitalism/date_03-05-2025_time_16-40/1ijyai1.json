And American propaganda of all kinds actively tries to close the mind to it and turn people against education.\n\nWithout revolutionary literature and speech and thought, there will not be a grand awakening of the American population.

I consider myself somewhere between a left libertarian and progressive liberal, probably more like a New Deal liberal (yes I know that's not held in much regard here, that's fine.)\n\nAnd I've been seeing this pivot towards fascism long before even Trump. I expect the Right to dismiss my warnings as \"fear mongering\" and \"hyperbolic\", some of whom tell me that in bad faith as they subconsciously or covertly support fascism. \n\nBut I especially hate that liberals and progressives dismissed my warnings all throughout Trump, even when January 6th happened. And then when Biden took office they got complacent again, despite the danger getting increasingly worse. \n\nI do admit I was guilty of naive faith in our justice system holding the fascists accountable, but in the back of mind I knew it probably wouldn't happen. I had hope that Trump was just so brazenly anti-democratic that the voters would see that. But unfortunately, there's too many factors at work that enabled his return to power.\n\nBut that's in the past now, we need to focus on the very real immediate fascist coup that's happening right now. And I think that all of us across the spectrum who see it for what it is, need to form alliances to stop it, just like we did 80 years ago. The only way we can defeat this fascist scum is to join forces and put differences aside. The only thing that matters now is survival and protecting everyone that's under threat from this menace.",
