Near the end of the civil war, Lincoln concluded that the bloodshed had been divine punishment for 200 years of slavery in the United States. For turning a blind eye, he thought God had punished the North by placing them into a position where they had to intervene in the South. The Confederacy was willing to negotiate with the Union, but only if both slavery and the right to expand slavery were explicitly enshrined in the Constitution. The issue is that while moderates such as Lincoln had been complacent, they really did oppose the further expansion of slavery.\n\nSo, the only choice was to endure the pain and fight. The defeat of the Union at the [First Battle of Bull Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run) shocked Northerners and helped them realize that victory would not come easily and would take great sacrifice on their part.",

For nearly a century, the entire Western world has been systematically brainwashed into thinking that Israel is both hero and victim, that it has an undeniable right to exist, that the actions of its sociopathic people are justified, etc. I don't think we have ever or maybe will ever see such an overwhelming, consistent, total propaganda campaign like that of \"Israel\", the US, Australia, and all its other cronies. \n\nOn top of that - once again, incredibly simplified - the world is both 1. So overwhelmed with the constant horrifying news and info that we've become numb to it and 2. More focused on our own individual crises than that of the greater world, like cost of living, legislation stripping minorities' rights, etc. This can be either as \"oh no, my right to xyz has been taken away\" or \"oh no, we have to take away the rights of [othered group] for our own safety\". Or the classic \"I can't worry about that, I have to afford rent this week\". This is by design. Keep us distracted with identity politics, both minor and major, distract us from the much bigger shit at play.\n\n\nETA: I was talking to my sister a few months back (for the first time in ages, for obvious reasons). She's 24. I mentioned something about missing a local protest against \"Israel\". Her response? \"What's that?\"\n\nI said, \"you know, Israel and all the terrible shit they're doing in Palestine\". \n\nShe says, \"What's Palestine?\"",

It's not about how someone in 1825 read about something happening on the other side of the planet in their local newspaper three months after the fact.\n\nThe way in which the population of Israel almost in its entirety shows enthusiastic support for what is being carried out against the Palestinians is something you can't really find an equivalent to in modern history.",

If the world took their eyes off them for even a second I have no doubt they would exterminate as many Palestinians as they could with broad public support, without any need to play the plausible deniability game to the world (though tbh it's not even plausible to deny a genocide is taking place anymore).
