That is not the same as providing independent journalists with access to training and resources.\n\nIf there is evidence they have done more then it would be interesting to see, although given that even major broadcasters in western countries are more editorially independent than RT, this seems unlikely.\n\n>There were shows getting Russian government money that were wiped off the internet after the Ukraine invasion.\n\nI'm not going to shed any tears when the propaganda arm of a fascist government is shut down.

That's not a good thing.\n\nThe US government is the one choosing to package superficial charity with media propaganda. They don't have to do that. They choose to because it's not intended as aid but as a means for geopolitical control. They aren't interested in providing *actual* aid that helps exploited countries materially develop (e.g. developing a modern local healthcare system and sanitation). They didn't even want to globalize COVID vaccine production during the pandemic because exploiting their patents as leverage was more important. \n\nThat's the other commenter's point. They didn't say \"ending USAID is good (and there shouldn't be any projects to help exploited countries)\". They said ending USAID is good.\n\nYour argument is like saying we're not allowed to be glad with the abolition of slavery because it also meant black people stopped getting food and housing from their owners. It's like you intentionally pretend every aspect of the social relation is independent from the other to glorify the social relation as a whole.",

Y'know, the newspaper owned by one of the hyper-wealthy oligarchs front and centre at Trump's inauguration.\n\nHere's a couple things to pay particular attention to (aside from the fact checking parts):\n\n(1) \"[According to surveys](https://archive.ph/o/CJhqh/https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/02/04/Voter-Ignorance-Threatens-Deficit-Reduction), many Americans have a misguided view of how much money the United States devotes to foreign aid. Polls consistently reveal that Americans believe that it is about 25 percent of the federal budget \u2014 and that [a majority believe](https://archive.ph/o/CJhqh/https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/public-opinion-supports-an-increased-us-foreign-aid-budget/) it should be more like 10 percent. *In reality, foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the budget*\" (my emphasis).\n\nSo already the amount of money being spent on foreign aid is considerably less than most people feel ought to be the case, and\n\n(2) \"In fiscal year 2023, USAID was appropriated about $25 billion by Congress, according to [ForeignAssistance.gov](https://archive.ph/o/CJhqh/foreignassistance.gov/). (The website in recent days has been changed to combine USAID spending with foreign aid distributed by the State Department, so the combined total is nearly $39 billion.) The White House identified only about $12 million in grants \u2014 one of which was $6 million \u2014 though one allegation vaguely claimed \u201chundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d Upon inspection, that turned out to be from 2005 to 2008.\"\n\nThis means that of the less 1% of the annual federal budget, the White House has claimed that about *0.03%* of **that less than 1%** was allocated in ways they feel are problematic. So, not even 0.0003% of the annual budget is what they are getting their knickers in a twist about here--*even if* their claims were accurate, which they are not, apparently.\n\nSo, yeah, Musk is doing a **great job** preventing all that \"massive fraud\" he claims to have uncovered at USAID, lmfao.\n\n^(The laughter is to indicate the /s of the statement, btw.)\n\nSo, you see how what you're pointing to is total propaganda to support a BS narrative, right?",
