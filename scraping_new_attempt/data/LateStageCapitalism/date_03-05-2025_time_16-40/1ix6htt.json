    "selftext": " Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, out esteemed (/s) president has ordered that all records of police misconduct be deleted. This opens the door for a lawless force of thugs with guns and a budget. \n\n\n\nI've been the victim of police misconduct and it hits on a whole new level. Especially when you know you did nothing wrong. \n\n\n\nBrown shirts will be wearing blue. \n\n\n\nI have no doubt that we will soon see the homeless communities disappear. Project 2025 makes it clear that we are undesirables. I bet even the so-called \"liberals\" will stand silently by. \n\n\n\nYes, I said we. I'm homeless. I worked my ass off starting at age 15, only to lose everything after an attempted murder left me with brain damage and unable to work. No longer a productive member of society, I have lived under bridges, in abandoned houses and in tents. \n\n\nBeing homeless means living in constant fear anyway, but this is the 1st time my fear has become palatable. Even though the cops around here don't really mess with me (much) because they know I don't do drugs or drink, I realize that the tripwire is always tight. \n\n\nI played by the rules all my life. Worked, saved , took care of my family. All to be lost to a deputy with a double digit IQ and a steroid problem. I've lost 2 tents and everything I had over the last 2 months, but this is where I get scared. \n\n\n\nHow many of you will stand with us when the time comes? \n\n\n\n(Just to be clear, because the word \"homeless\" is usually enough to have a post removed and the occasional permaban. I am not soft begging or asking for any kind of help. For the moment I am good. I have about everything I need. Thanks.)",

A lot of people say that having Trump and Elon cause chaos with a bunch of morons in top positions is a cunning move, but it looks like a group of people summoning a tornado and trying to build a house in it. Everything they are doing is increasing the chance of class consciousness spreading.",

All white flag shelters have come to an end in my immediate area, for example. \n\nBut what this administration has done with strengthening a police force that is already on the verge of going rogue will be the end of us. The relationship between Leo and the homeless is already fraught with danger. The next step, according to Playbook 2025 is to make it almost impossible to hold the police accountable for misconduct. I think that explains why police unions overwhelmingly backed Trump. \n\nOf course, at the end of the day, this is just my opinion.",
