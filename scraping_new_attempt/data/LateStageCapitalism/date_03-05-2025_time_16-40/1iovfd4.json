Not only did the \"allies\" refuse this gesture, they leaked this effort to Germany. Only France was interested.\n\nWhy? Cause the \"allies\" knew Germany wanted to go east, and that's fine.",

Which made that award more true to the intention of the prize than many others in the last few decades, but it was also coloured by the hyped optimism in Europe that this was a turning point for the US after 8 years of Bush.\n\nObviously the committee should have been far more cautious about selecting a newly elected US president and there's precedent that they should have included the other party to that non-proliferation agreement as well to make it clear what the prize was meant to highlight - which would have meant Obama and Putin ought to have shared the prize.\n\nWith that mentioned, nominations to the peace prize are not an exclusive group, as any member of a national parliament anywhere in the world or any professor in certain fields (history, politics etc) can nominate whoever they please. There's hundreds of nominations every year, and many of them are entered by sycophants as a service to their \"great leader\".",

My issue with Trump doing this is that he'll carve this up so poorly and be in the pocket of Putin, but wanting this to end is not necessarily 'liberalism', it's understanding that they will get behind the table eventually, and in view of international worker solidarity, the sooner the better, but the terms need to be fair and done so it doesn't exclude Ukraine.\n\nThe comparisons to the 30's are disingenuous, shortsighted and lazy because they exclude the important role of NATO in this.",
