The points Politico highlighted aren\u2019t *quite* a representative sample of the doc\u2019s contents. (It is pretty instructive to note which ones piqued politico\u2019s interest.) \n\nAs the doc makes all too clear, Dems are hopeless on many levels. Just a slower train to the same place. But I\u2019d prefer to be deeply disappointed and disgusted with Dem \u201cleadership\u201d and all its attendant shittiness without also having the very real fear that my mom will lose her social security, home, and ability to feed herself at any moment.

Embrace patriotism, community, and traditional imagery (these are included in some of the most fascistic sections of P2025)\n2. Ban far-left/refuse to participate in purity tests (this is probably the most consistent element of P2025 so far)\n3. Push back against far-left staffers/groups (there are hundreds of pages on this and it's a huge part of what Musk is currently doing with the Federal Government)\n4. Owning the failures of Democratic governance and committing to improving local government (tons of overlap here in scapegoating and a \"we'll finally fix it now\" attitude)\n\nThe wild thing to me is that P2025 justifies itself with protecting the \"hard won rights of women\", \"opposing racist policies/ideologies\", and \"protecting vulnerable communities (like children and the disabled)\" by pushing literal fascism. Liberals do the exact same bullshit, and I guarantee that implementation of any/all of the points in the post would be justified by the same things. \n\nIf someone claims to be acting in the best interests of the vulnerable and that they are championing human rights, always look at what they do.
