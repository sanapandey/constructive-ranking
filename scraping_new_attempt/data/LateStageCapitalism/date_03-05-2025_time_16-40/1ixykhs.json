Create incredibly wrong economic models, make them politically accepted, and then political process making them the mainstream economic view, and refute every opposing model because the norm now has different truths.\n\n\nThe whole process is liberals find something that is well written and articulate and promote it to be the immutable word of God, and justify every action based on the assumptions they take as undisputed truth.",
