Or them. It's like when the Republican Party tries to say that they are punk or that Rage Against the Machine has changed or Star Trek went woke. \n\nThey're not entitled to buy everything that has been used to make fun of the bastards. Let's not perpetuate the idea that they have any shred of cool like they want us to.",
