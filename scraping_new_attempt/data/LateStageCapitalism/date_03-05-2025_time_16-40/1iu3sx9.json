    "selftext": "I'm sure we've all pondered what you do with a time machine, looking back on all the people who would say, \"One of the first things I'd do is kill hitler.\" \n\nWould you? Look at what you are doing now, we are watching the rise of fascism sprouting faster than bamboo, and we are watching, cowering, and not doing anything. I've come to the conclusion that with a time machine, there aren't many people with the actual balls to kill hitler. For all this talk about punching nazis, we have people who are doing fuckin nazi salutes at the goddamnned presidential inauguration. All this talk, all this rhetoric, and we are doing nothing. \n\nThose phrases and what ifs mean nothing now. They don't spark the fear that kept fascist scum down anymore because there is no more meaning in it, no action behind it. \n\nI'm not saying we do anything extreme, But make sure you have the ability to take action behind those words, be ready to punch a nazi, because the chances of that needing to happen is rising everyday. Be active in your community, know your neighbors,  be aware of those who will need help the most, and be aware of who back fascism.\n\nOutside countries are not going to help, you can't rely on Denmark to buy california or whatever nonsense is going around right now. Outside countries are focusing in to prep themselves, because we all know what happened when hitler finally took complete control, and I doubt they will make the same mistakes as were made in ww2 when it comes to just handing over territory for appeasement in the beginning.\n\n Arm yourself, prep yourself, be prepared for the worst, and let's all hope for the best.",

Biden sent over $17.9 billion dollars (please correct this number if you can bc I feel like it\u2019s higher) to Isntreal instead of helping the struggling, suffering American people with those funds.\n\nFor all this talk about fascism, people seem to be incredibly comfortable with the status quo (funding genocides, increasing police funding, letting the working class suffer) until trump is in office, despite being perfectly fine with fascism under prior democratic rule.\n\nFor all this talk about punching Nazis and hating fascism, people seem to fail to recognize the fact that Biden and the CDC prematurely allowed everyone to vax & relax + unmask in 2021 and now we have an ongoing blaring Covid-19 pandemic, which people are still dying from and during which disability rates have soared.\n\nFor all this talk about punching Nazis and hating fascism, people fail to be knowledgeable of the fact that the United States didn\u2019t fight Nazis out of altruism or caring about the Holocaust on the Jewish people, they did so for their personal interests.",

Hitler and nazi germany put American values on a pedestal and sped run the entire process ( or the US pulled the breaks a bit). Once everything was said and done, the US took that credit and ran with it. This is why I think  a huge chunk of the population is compliant, the usa proclaims anti nazi rhetoric when both our history and actions speak otherwise. But \"we stopped the nazis theres no way theyve infiltrated us.\" When no infiltration was needed.\n\nThe whole system was built for the wealthy and privileged  from the very start when they tried to make voting only for land owning people. In USA history, only a fraction of it has the people rather than robber barons running it. A majority, if not all of our presidents are war criminals, I think Franklin Roosevelt was the last \"people\" president, and even that could be considered a stretch.\n\nIt's also why we are seeing so many people support a genocide, we never got rid of the problem, we just let it fester, and they are going to keep trying to make their monstrous future the boring status quo, an imperialist birth defect the country was born with.\n\nEdit:the United States was built on more than one genocide",

The mask is completely off, and there is no excuse it. No amount of stupid could miss this. We all KNOW what it was.

Those factors don't necessarily apply to today.\n\nFighting is serious business. Nazis deserve a punch in the face, sure, but the way fights end is exactly how the winner of the fight wants it to end, and often that can be permanent. Is it cowardly to be cautious at times like these? Maybe. I'll tell you one thing, though: you shouldn't get violent unless you're prepared to get deadly violent, because there's no telling where your opponent's line will be. You win the fight; you can be merciful,  but only a fool assumes their opponent has their back and will stop after they yield. \n\nFantasies about revolution must always, eventually, come to terms with the outcomes of violence. They aren't pretty, or noble, moral or righteous-- even if their cause is. Think hard about it before you commit. And don't be so quick to think poorly of those that shy away from that commitment... because win or lose, it's a doozy.",
