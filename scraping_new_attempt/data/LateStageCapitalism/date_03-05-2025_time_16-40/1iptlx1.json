Idk I\u2019m just tired of feeling like I\u2019m getting charged an arm and a leg for irrigation, electricity, and heat. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

Great question i think, though its beginning is probably more blurry than the recent context so i might reccommend putting a time frame such as since the beginning of USA, if thats what youre interested in. Get the right question and then you could take it to askhistorian for a higher quality answer, if not literature recommendations.",

            "body": "So, I haven\u2019t read any books on it, but in my area there are two power companies. Georgia Power and a local customer owned power company. You don\u2019t get to choose, it is based on where you live, but I\u2019ve talked to my mother in law(in her 80s) about the local one, and she remembers when they went around getting people to sign up, and the incentives they provided. She owns a share of the company and can cash out, I think, anytime, but she plans on holding onto it and letting her kids cash it out. I know Georgia Power has acquired a lot of these local power companies, and, I would assume, dismantled their original promises and such. \n\nMy assumption based on what I know, is that originally when the services became available (either through government funding or community desire) little local companies went round to everyone and offered incentives to get enough \u201ccustomers\u201d on board to motivate implementation of the infrastructure. Then later, companies either became insolvent or were offered incentives/threats from larger companies that then acquired the smaller companies and became big powerhouses like GeorgiaPower. After getting to a certain level of monopoly, customer satisfaction became less of a motivator for the companies (like Southern Bell, an awful phone company, that only lost its power after the rise of cell phones and internet or the cable companies, who only lost power after the rise of Netflix). \n\nThere is corollary between this and the apple houses in Ellijay. From what I\u2019ve read, the apple houses started as coops formed during the government funding era after the depression (cc camps and all that), none of them are coops now, they are all individually owned usually by one family. My best guess on how this happened was either, those families were heavily involved with the coop and interest waned/money got tight and they bought out the others, or they swooped in and purchased it in a financially stressful time. It\u2019s possible it was more insidious depending on who they were. I\u2019ve heard some real horror stories of what some of the richest folks have gotten up to in this area. I do have a good book on that type of thing about the kaolin industry\u2019s start in Washington County called Red Clay, Pink Cadillacs and White Gold. It\u2019s out of print but well worth finding at the library. It kind of opens your eyes on the bullshit straight up lies and trickery that can be involved in parting poor folks from something valuable.",
