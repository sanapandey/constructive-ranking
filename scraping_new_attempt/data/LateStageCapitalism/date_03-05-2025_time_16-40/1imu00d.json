Jews fled Christian kingdoms to escape persecution to Muslim ones. This is not a defence of kingdoms, it's simply that claims that Muslim people are innately hostile to Jews is bunk, as the historical record shows.\n\nThe fanaticism in Israel is quite secular. There are religious factions in the Israeli regime but the secular and \"liberal\" factions are just as genocidal. Go peddle your reactionary sectarianism elsewhere!",

They're still terrorists and religious zealots, they're extremists whose values couldn't be further away from the values of the left. \n\nFuck Hamas, they're not a good representation for Palestinians. The only lesson to be taken from them is that Israel created monsters through their campaign of violence, but they're monsters still.",
