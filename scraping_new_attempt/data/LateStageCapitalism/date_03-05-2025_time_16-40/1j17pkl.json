They also attempted making deals with middle eastern leaders to permanently relocate Gazans but behind closed doors. If Trump gets some exploitative deal signed with Ukraine, Dems will clutch their pearls over it then not change course once they take back power. \n\nBut republicans definitely do speed the process up and do it more explicitly. Even though they definitely both go in the same direction there\u2019s absolutely a very valid harm reduction argument to be made for dem foreign policy\n\nAlso not related but Libs seem to think America is aligning with Russia/China. I think America wants to strip Russia away from China and divert to a more anti-China foreign policy. America is a failing empire and will not go quietly. China is on pace to overtake Americas economy in the coming decade(s), and their military machine is rapidly becoming stronger. America still has the biggest stick and will for some time, and they will not fade quietly. They\u2019re going to have to drum up some excuse over the next few years to cripple China, and even if America is openly exploiting its western allies they will still ultimately fall in line",

The shift to actual dislike happened when he won, and shattered liberals smug illusions about what they've liked to tell themselves they think they know about politics. You know what I mean, think back on any glib explanation you've ever been given on why Democrats couldn't do something when they were in power that basically amounted to a condescending \"yeah that's not how politics work\".\n\nTrump comes along and ignores all decorum where Dem presidents had limits he suddenly has free reign. Apparently they have had no idea \"how politics work\" this whole time, and this dumb nepo baby is making them look stupid, and everything they believed to be true look like a laughable lie.",

This was a forced upward transfer of wealth, also with everyday people being forced to die in war.\n\nTrump recently suggested a 50% cut in the US military budget which was the biggest lie that's ever been told.\n\nTrump is trying to come to an agreement with Russia because it would begin to allow for the extraction of Ukrainian rare earth minerals and to try to buddy up to Putin and decouple Russia from China because China is the true target at the end of the day.\n\nLiberals are shocked at Trump's brazenness but this is how the empire has always acted.\n\nI see people stupidly comparing Ukraine to Palestine when it is a western proxy and more like Israel (another western proxy) than it is Palestine.\n\nThe liberal reaction to Trump is really disgusting me because capitalism is decaying and with the way liberals are resisting Trump, they continue to be enablers of him and Musk.",

Post WW2, what kept the US on its toes was the existence of the USSR. After the Soviet Union fell, the US had no reason to keep things under control and domestic politics went haywire, leading to someone like Trump coming into power. \n\nAnd anyone who thinks Trump is the worst of it is either stupid, or in on the whole thing. There are already people like the brainworm guy, DeSantis, and other smaller extremists that actually believe their ideology.

Dismissing voting third party because they are \u201cuseless\u201d or because you are \u201cthrowing your vote away\u201d also violates this rule. It also encompasses saying Trump is \u201cworse\u201d for Gaza, as that place is already completely destroyed. Trump is merely carrying out what the american ruling class started under Biden. Resorts being built and mass relocation were already happening under Biden and Kamala would\u2019ve continued it.",
