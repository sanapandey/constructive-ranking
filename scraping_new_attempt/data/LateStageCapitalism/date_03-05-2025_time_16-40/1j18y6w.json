It will most likely never be acted upon militarily unless heavily provoked, which neither side wants at the moment, so atm its just a big \"yelling across a river\" situation waiting to see the west fold sooner or later.\n\nThe Uyghur situation is just not true, there has been wrongful imprisonments and violent clashes with the extremists in the region but it is definitely not an extermination/genocide. China needed to deal with the Muslim extremists in the region and put the people they've found to hold extremist ideals to be educated on why its like, yk, bad. These re education facilities are not what the West wants you to believe, it's quite literally just an adult school but for your ideals, there is no torture or castration or anything of the sort. The West's favorite way of dealing with Muslim extremism first of all, overseas 98% of the time, and second, usually set off by Western support, is to militarily get rid of them, along with civilians. This is what they've done in Afghanistan and Palestine, just off the top of my head. The Uyghurs enjoy religious freedom, China does not aim to exterminate the ethnicity, nor the religion, but the violent extremists in the region, and as peacefully as they can manage.\n\nI will say the South China sea expansion I have not looked into much, so I can't talk about it.\n\nNo hate!

Imperialism refers specifically to a system that arose in industrialized capitalist nations in which the development of monopolies necessitated expansion into new markets.

Yes, that\u2019s just semantics, but it\u2019s important to understand because this is the foundation of anti-imperialist thought. I\u2019m not saying this to defend China, I\u2019m saying it to clarify a very important part of modern Marxist theory.",
