However, we need to remember that human beings are complex, are products of their time, and that not everything can be viewed through the lens of being black or white.  \n\nFor example:\nThe Greeks gave us democracy, but were quite sexist and were slavers.\nThe Arabs gave us a fuck ton of mathematics, but tended to be pretty fundamentalist in their policies.\nHell, the calendar we use was developed by Julius Caesar and then updated by Pope Gregory, and while I know of the horrible things Caesar did, I\u2019m sure Gregory also did some less-than-honorable acts (especially with the Catholic Church at the time)\n\nHumans are complicated.  And to paint a human as all good or all bad is just disingenuous.  Nuance and context are important.\n\n(I swear to God, if y\u2019all take this spiel as me being pro-slaver or pro-murder, you need to read about history more before you\u2019re doomed to repeat it.)",
