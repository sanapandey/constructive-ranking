There was also purge of intellectuals and bureaucrats from the previous regime.  \n\nMoreover, building factories and the corresponding required infrastructure to export anything takes time, even if they wanted to engage in international trade, they would not have been yet capable of producing much to bring to international markets. Furthermore, they weren't yet very interested in doing so, prior to 1972 China was one of the most heavily protectionist nations in the 20th century.\n\nThere should probably be a single link between China and the USSR as the Soviets were initially supportive of the Great Leap Forward before Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated and surely included some material support if mostly one way from the USSR to China.  But otherwise, most of the nations that would be their natural regional trading partners were also not in a position to do a lot of trade back.   The Korean peninsula was still recovering from the Korean war and the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between China and the DPRK wasn't signed until 1961, and much of Indochina was still recovering from the first Indochina War and the unofficial start of the Vietnam War occurred in early 1960, when the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam began armed resistance against our puppet regime there. And don't think we even have to mention Japan in this timeframe.",
