Not to mention, Musk\u2019s history in South Africa has revealed that he\u2019s always been pro-fascist and pro-Nazi, it runs in his family and the salute was common among them in South Africa. Jewish people today are not in any imminent danger from some dictator or group and yet the Zionists still align themselves with people who would otherwise want to eliminate them, make it make sense.",

I completely agree with you that the ADL and their application of the label has been highly selective and politically expedient.\n\n      For the moment, Musk is essentially the co-president of the most powerful nation in the world. He also is doing so as part of a coalition that is composed of a significant number of evangelicals who believe Israel's resurrection as a state and the rebuilding of a second temple is essential to bringing about the end times.\n\n     There are a lot of reasons it's easier politically to sidestep that indiscretion and the political influence that may bring over the current administration. With Kanye, it's easier to point and apply the label because it highlights the problem of antisemitism continuing to exist and costs nothing politically.\n\n    Again every single part of that is bad. But politically it's a short term gain for a long term loss in credibility.",
