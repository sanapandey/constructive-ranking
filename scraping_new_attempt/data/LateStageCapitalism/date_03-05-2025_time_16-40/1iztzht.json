    "selftext": "People seem to get really angry/defensive/ gaslight me when I remind them of the fact that we\u2019re in an ongoing pandemic that Biden \u201cended\u201d for the purpose of capitalism. The bottom line is that the rate and levels of illness people are experiencing are not normal, and I know this as an immunocompromised person who has experienced getting repeatedly ill. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to face the fact that many of us vax and relaxed in 2021 but it\u2019s better late than never to get back into protecting ourselves and each other, especially with RFK in tow, who knows what will happen with vaccines? \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that on top of everything else, covid-19 wasn\u2019t prioritized to a point where it could become manageable. It\u2019s not fair that Joe Biden instilled a level of carelessness and cognitive dissonance within everyone to the point that people seem to be clueless about why everyone is so sick so often these days??? Couldn\u2019t be due to the T-cell damage from repeated Covid-19 infections, no? \n\nIf this upsets you, it should. It\u2019s really f-cking upsetting. But ask yourself why it upsets you instead of gaslighting a person who is more at risk and saying some weak sh-t like \u201cthere will always be disease\u201d (there are also ways to avoid disease, would you say the same thing about avoiding syphilis or HIV? Why are mitigations no longer important when it comes to protecting other people or yourself from a multi-organ damaging disease? And it doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cmild\u201d your Covid-19 infection was. \n\nIf you\u2019re hosting events or organizing, now is a really good time to make them \u201cmask required.\u201d Now is a really good time to give a sh-t about other people in one of the most accessible ways possible, protecting them from your exhalations + preventing spread. Some people really need to rethink their values if they consider themselves leftists, yet refuse to acknowledge the very real issue that is the ongoing pandemic + how Biden\u2019s ending of precautions and most of our willingness to go along with it has affected society & disabled people, how many people it has disabled, and how many people it has killed. \n\nSigned, immunocompromised individual who has had some nasty responses towards my comments about carelessness toward the quad-demic as of late. Immunocompromised individual who would love to see my grandma who is sick with cancer + has autoimmune disease, so it\u2019s too unsafe to even see her because of the state of public health. ",
