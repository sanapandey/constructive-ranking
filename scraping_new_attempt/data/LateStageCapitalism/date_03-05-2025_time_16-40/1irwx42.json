The Hind Rajab Foundation has made dozens of complaints in more than 10 countries.\n\n\u2022 The campaign has yet to yield any arrests. But it has led Israel to tighten restrictions on social media usage among military personnel.\n\n\u2022 The 1949 Geneva Conventions specify that all signatories must prosecute war criminals or hand them over to a country who will. The U.N.\n\n\u2022 Security Council asked all U.S. countries to include universal jurisdiction in their legal codes, and around 160 countries have adopted them.\n\n\u2022 The group built its case around Vagdani\u2019s own social media posts, a photograph showed him in uniform in Gaza. The case against Vagdana was brought by the Hind Raja Foundation, a legal group based in Belgium.\n\n\u2022 The director general of Israel\u2019S Foreign Ministry, Eden Bar Tal, last month said fewer than a dozen soldiers had been targeted. The cases are sponsored by a very low number of entities that have direct connections to terrorist organizations, a co-founder of the foundation said.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 [TipJar](https://paypal.me/paulfox360?country.x=IN&locale.x=en_GB) \n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.*",
