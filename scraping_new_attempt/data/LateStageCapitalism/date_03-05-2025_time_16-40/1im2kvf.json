The surrogate is doing it under implicit threat (of homelessness, starvation, etc.) even if she swears she wants to and is not being coerced.\n\nSecond, there should be no better choice. Some people can't have kids, but just because they can't doesn't mean they dont deserve a child that is their blood. This is a whole other story (what does it matter if the kid is your blood or adopted?), but I can get that some people want kids to be theirs in that sense, and is shitty that most of us can simply make a kid, but they can't.\n\nAnyway, I dont think point 1 is posible under capitalism except maybe for rich people, and I dont see a growing population of rich surrogates.",

We have horrible access to reproductive care and soaring rates of maternal mortality and other perinatal complications compared to other developed countries. That\u2019s not even touching the ethics that a living woman\u2019s womb and consent to use it is a marketable good. Like all exploitative industries, the number of individuals entering them voluntarily free from coercion will always be the minority. If abolishing an exploitative industry requires those privileged few individuals who entered it voluntarily to leave, they should be willing to do so. Sorry if it sounds harsh, but I will always side with protecting women coerced into selling their bodies vs protecting the privileges of a small amount of women who do this \u201cvoluntarily\u201d. I feel like this concept is so readily understood in every other industry except surrogacy and sex work.",

A lot of rich and famous women who \u201cmysteriously\u201d emerge mere days post-partum on a beach in south France for the paparazzi and look exactly the same as they did 10 months prior didn\u2019t actually just give birth, they simply paid another woman to do it for them. The one thing I *will* say about lily Collins is that, at the very least, she actually came out and admitted it to everyone. Maybe she was outed somehow and basically forced to come clean, maybe she decided to on her own, idk. I mean, she probably did it intentionally just based on the fact that *so many* famous women use surrogates that it wouldn\u2019t really even be much of a story at all; it\u2019s a glaring open secret in those circles, why else would there be a whole surrogacy industry that\u2019s thriving and growing day by day? Most of them just use another woman\u2019s body as an incubation chamber, disappear for 9 months (also Google the word \u201cmoonbump\u201d if you aren\u2019t familiar), then crawl back out of the woodwork hours after the baby is born with an even more killer bod than they\u2019ve ever had before and let everyone think they did all the work and still immediately bounced back. Hilary Baldwin is pretty notorious for this, just as an example. \n\nWhile I still find Collins\u2019 situation pretty gross\u2014especially since she has no health conditions or anything that would make it risky or impossible to bear children\u2014the latter to me is even more revolting and abhorrent by far. Like, hey I\u2019m already getting away with exploiting a poor woman to fake a pregnancy, might as well lie about it and make every woman on earth who\u2019s actually given birth feel even worse than they already do about their post-partum bodies by making myself look like a genetic anomaly \ud83d\ude0e I actually have childhood memories in the supermarket queue with my mom next to the row of tabloid magazines and her remarks about \u201chow the heck does so-and-so look so good 2 days after having a baby?? Guess she won the genetic lottery, life is so unfair!\u201d Meanwhile the old lady cashier is shaking her head and grinning in agreement and my 11 year old self is standing there in bewilderment like \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f  \n\nLike, no they didn\u2019t, there\u2019s no \u201cgenetic lottery\u201d rich people magically possess, they\u2019re just exponentially fucking disgustingly wealthy and it\u2019s most likely fake, or they paid a plastic surgeon and physical trainer $3 mil each and then hired a team of full-time nannies and tutors because god forbid they have to ever deal with even the most minor of consequences of existing as a human being. Literally partly why I developed an eating disorder as a tween. Everything about it\u2019s truly fucking vile, but it happens allllll the time. Needs to be made illegal, without question, though it never will be in the US. No way in hell the Uber wealthy will give up the opportunity to outsource the labor of growing their own genetically legitimate spawn now that they\u2019ve had that power for as long as it\u2019s been scientifically possible, esp in a country that routinely tells its citizens over and over again how much it fucking hates every one of us whose net worth isn\u2019t at least top 5%.\n\n**Edited to add a side note after finding and reading the article: fuck this headline, and fuck the author and Collins\u2019 PR team that hired them to write it\u2014every person has the explicit right to judge Lily Collins for this just like we can judge her for being successful despite her SHIT ASS acting solely because of nepotism. We judge people all the time, in fact most rich folk judge the poor for every single thing they do and no one ever calls them out for it. We all reserve the right to judge her and her ilk, especially when it comes to their abundant and intentional exploitation of other people who have so much less than they do, using that to their advantage so they can get all the best out of life without having to sacrifice anything for it whatsoever. Getting to have their own genetic spawn without risking their own health, gaining weight, getting stretch marks or whatever it is they\u2019re so afraid of despite having all the money in the world to buy the very best medical care, cosmetic procedures, physical trainers and nutritionists that have ever existed. When was the last time you heard about a rich/famous woman (or the partner of a rich/famous man) dying in childbirth? I can\u2019t think of any 21st century examples, but it is happening more and more to American women especially those who are poor or POC. Fuck lily collins and fuck paid surrogacy. Let\u2019s all take a moment or two or ten to judge the ever-living shit out of her and her Lily-white wealthy nepotistic ass\n\nHoly crap I just ranted an entire essay, Jesus lol. But I mean every word of it, fuck allllla this noise and all these dumb ass paid thought pieces defending this crap. This article literally states that we shouldn\u2019t judge lily Collins for not adopting and that \u201cyou and I\u201d should adopt orphans instead, nearly word for word, as though it\u2019s the working class\u2019s duty to provide for needy children when we have almost nothing while these nepo babies have all the money in the damn world. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have endless resources to adopt all the children on my <50,000$ a year salary because the post-Reagan oligarchs turned adoption into a for-profit industry that now costs upwards of $30,000 per child in adoption fees alone (and that\u2019s on the low end). \n\nJust FYI, the author of this pathetic excuse of an article is some sycophant fuck named Claire Cohen who \u201cworks\u201d for British vogue, and if she happens to come across this comment, I want her to know that she\u2019s a total SHIT writer who can suck the norovirus diarrhea straight out of my asshole and floss her teeth with the pubes that line it \ud83d\ude0b",

I know some people who\u2019s gone to the US paying around $100000 whereas others go to Ukraine because it\u2019s cheaper. This caused to problems when the war broke out because the biological parents could not come and pick their children up and the surrogat mothers had no rights or responsibility for those children. They had to be left in orphanage for a while. Sick system if you ask me. I don\u2019t judge people on an individual basis for going to those lengths but it seems a bit too common amongst celebrities these days. Like Kim K already had two, to buy another women\u2019s body seems quite selfish in that situation.\n\nETA: I also know a woman in the UK (I lived there for a decade) who\u2019s done it twice. Now, she also used to work for many years as an escort. It seems to me that she had some mental health issues surrounding her own body, and I think going from one to the other is not that much of a stretch and one can certainly ask if why either should be ok. But then again, from the child\u2019s point of view I\u2019m not sure about egg/sperm donation or even adoption. But I haven\u2019t got all the answers.",

The surrogate wanted a selective reduction (when you abort one twin but not the other) to reduce the pregnancy to one baby. The \"parents\" were against that and pressured the woman to give birth to triplets.

Things that might seem reasonable to the not yet pregnant surrogate but then are claustrophobic when pregnancy hormones and symptoms kick in. It really is like being cattle.\n\nEach pregnancy is very different and potentially dangerous for any woman and unless the contract  provides for each situation that can possibly happen, there might just not be enough money. People think $50,000-$100,000 is a lot of money but that's only a year or two of salary and can quickly run out with hospital bills and lifetime injury.

That's not necessarily untrue! I actually agree with that in some regard, because like sex work, surrogacy in the US is unregulated to the point where it causes *victims.* And until the market is regulated to ensure the safety of workers and consumers, sorry!

There are often complex, profound physical and psychological changes that result from pregnancy, and very often, it is traumatic for a woman to carry a baby to term and then have it taken from her - even if her consent for this was bought, or given beneficently. \n\n[Article about some of the potential trauma from surrogacy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2023/07/17/a-psychologist-explores-the-complex-emotional-costs-of-surrogacy/)",

Certainly not men.\n\n\nNone of this is responsive to any of what I said. My statement doesn't deny the status quo of exploitation. It simply states that there are potentials for states of agency even within capitalism. If you want to argue the position of capitalist realism that mark fisher makes, go ahead. We can talk about how women are exploited but your framing is always consistent with material pessimism. My claim doesn't deny the reality of capitalism and how it reifies patriarchy....it's a question of not recognizing moments of liberation even within the dreary mechanisms of capitalism. For you to claim that the logistics of capitalism put women in a permanent state of commodification seems to reject notions of rejecting those very structures....\n\n>Sure, surrogacy affords a woman the liberation from pregnancy while still being able to have a kid, but under feminism, what about the woman whose livelihood comes from renting out her womb and taking on the longterm health toll because she needs the money? \n\nNow you are intentionally ignoring my arguments and the previous ones for the optics of debate. The other women mentions the blisses of surrogacy as those moments of liberation. My argument is that your disadvantages cannot be an AN ABSOLUTE prescription regarding the status of surrogacy. If you are going to argue in good faith about material consequences, why would you deny the cases where both parties successfully got what they wanted? Pregnancy is a biologically complex process but the complexity of the process is not a reason for women to never have any agency when they willingly choose to be pregnant. Yes there are cases of financial exploitation...but that is not the intrinsic definition or intention of surrogacy. \n\nThe differential circumstances surrounding the process means that surrogacy IS complex AND SHOULD NOT BE given the absolutist labels that you and other redditors do on this sub.",

I've actually been thinking about surrogacy a lot lately (the concept, not considering doing it myself lol) but I kept jumping back and forth between different perspectives. I do think having a strict 'surrogacy is completely unethical' approach isn't very considerate of a woman's agency and almost feels infantilizing. At first I felt like it made sense but after reading many opinions & posts on it, it seems like a lot of the arguments are similar to those of swerfs. Either way I just can't see how completely abolishing surrogacy could end well, prohibiting anything just makes it way more unsafe for those still choosing to participate, regardless. Anyways, thank you for putting it so nicely. Im actually going to save your comment so I can come back & reflect later when I have more time, if you don't mind?",

That doesn\u2019t serve elite interests? Because most women aren\u2019t at the Lily Collins end of the transaction.\u00a0\n\nSurrogacy and pregnancy doesn\u2019t occur in an economic vacuum. Where I\u2019m from, it rarely occurs between women from the same economic class. Ignoring the economic factors and reducing things to \u201cboth parties get what they want\u201d is an oversimplification of the so-called \u201ccomplex\u201d phenomenon you\u2019re insisting. Because very few women realize a livelihood in surrogacy without economic pressures.\n\nSurrogacy is an entire industry that relies on mostly poor women\u2019s reproductive capabilities. In my country there are agencies that capitalize on and manage women into being surrogates for well-off women here and abroad. \u00a0Surrogacy isn\u2019t very complex when there\u2019s an entire class of women whose bodies are more likely to be used for this purpose than others.

For example, intensive cognitive behavioral therapy is reported to have a 30-50% rate of achieving successful remission of bulimia nervosa. But, as with most chronic conditions, successful treatment does not mean a person is now cured for life of all eating disorder symptoms. In reality, there are many things that can cause a relapse of eating disorders. Fun fact, since we're talking about choosing to become a parent: pregnancy is actually considered the most obvious/notorious trigger by most healthcare professionals. Additional fun fact along this tangent: most of the medications used for long term management of eating disorders are not considered safe for use in pregnancy.\n\nAnd it's also true that therapy is a great tool that can be instrumental to some people's health and recovery -- be that from eating disorders, other mental health conditions, or even as a way to deal with situational stressors or trauma.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that requiring people with mental illnesses to go to therapy and be cured before they're allowed to reproduce would be eugenics. Nor does it mean that someone dealing with lifelong struggles with a mental health condition is bad or selfish if they choose to become a parent.",

A surrogate mother must agree to do it for free, but she can be refunded for some reasonable costs. As average, 400 children are born every year via a surrogacy that exists outside economical and political influence ([source](https://brilliantbeginnings.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Parliamentary-briefing-paper-2023.pdf))",
