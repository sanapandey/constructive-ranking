Sometimes a few harmless protests, no biggie. Not our responsibility to give a good deal or even a fair one, pay the workers as little as you can get away with.\n\nthis crap happens in Europe aswell and a lot needs to be done to tackle this, It's good to see Boycotts being more and more used and people ''voting with their wallets'', especially in eastern europe the last few weeks there has been some action but that can only be a start.",

Where it goes i have no idea.\u00a0\n\n\nI used to think a general strike was impossible in America, but now I see the possibility. Trump is creating conditions that are necessitating that reaction. There's nothing abstract about the conditions Trump is creating it is very clear when they hit\u00a0",

The 80s destroyed unions. The 90s and 00s is where the digital revolution contributed to productivity via improved software/automation. \n\nWhat happened in the 2010s to cause productivity gains to plateau? Offshoring niches fully saturated? If AI fails to optimize manufacturing further, compensation may re-couple with productivity gains and we'll have only lost 4 decades worth of income growth to the vampires at the top.  Will capitalism fail to suppress wages further, then, as capitalists are forced to admit that labor holds all the cards in production businesses, afterall?",

Because of that, it was also stolen from local and federal taxes that would have been collected from those workers' higher earnings, and there would have been higher spending/consumption which could be good for , especially local, business (and local sales tax etc.  if any, which would help municipalities with struggling budgets).\n\n If the wealth explosion at the top since the late 80s had instead gone more into wages across the board, social security would have been funded more all of those years.  Instead, the wealth being siphoned from greater productivity to the top was outside of the 150k earning social security taxation cap.",
