The fundamental contradiction to capitalism (IMO, and there are many others) is the fact that it creates poverty for the masses faster than it creates wealth for the parasitic few.  This means that each successive generation is - and is guaranteed to be - worse off than the previous one.  Capitalism ensures that more people move down the ladder than up it and is the root cause of pretty much all of our problems as a society.",

Just had a horrible discussion with my father because I said things are going to get hard in the US to which he answered  \"Thats Biden's fault, Trump is going to fix it\", this stupid media have brainwashed everyone at that include my parents and now it is so insufferable to talk to them.",
