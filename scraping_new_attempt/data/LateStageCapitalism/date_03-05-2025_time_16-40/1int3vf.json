Search results are compiled from over 400 different sources, making it more than just a simple rebranding of another search engine's results.\n\nBing and Yahoo: DuckDuckGo uses search results from Bing and Yahoo, which are part of the Yahoo-Bing search alliance. This partnership allows DuckDuckGo to leverage the extensive indexing capabilities of these larger search engines.\n\nDuckDuckBot: DuckDuckGo has its own web crawler, known as DuckDuckBot, which indexes web pages independently. This crawler helps in providing unique results that might not be available through other sources.\n\nCrowdsourced Sites: Data from crowdsourced sites like Wikipedia is used to populate knowledge panel boxes, enhancing the search experience with additional information.\n\nOther Partners: DuckDuckGo also sources results from other partners, including Yandex and Wolfram Alpha, to ensure a diverse range of information.\"\n\nI can say I do get some unique results from DDG doing the same exact search vs Google and Bing.
