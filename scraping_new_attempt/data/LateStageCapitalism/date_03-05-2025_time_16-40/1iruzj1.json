    "selftext": "Ever since I learned marxist theory and discovered the inherent contradictions in the extreme capitalist hellscape that is called America, I can\u2019t help but view any ads/commercial I see in a class conscious lens. \n\nThey are constantly bombarding us with propaganda compelling us into mass consumption of things that we don\u2019t need or even want. \n\nEvery ad/commercial just reeks of desperation and manipulation tactics; full of misleading claims and sometimes outright lies telling us that their specific product will improve our lives and solve our problems. \n\nEveryone everywhere is just trying to make a sale,turn a profit. It disgusts me so much. None of these people actually give a damn or genuinely care about helping people. Even seemingly innocuous things like childrens hospitals, for profit online colleges, drug commercials, accident lawyers etc are just emotionally targeted ploys used to exploit your very real fears into larger numbers on some rich asshole\u2019s spreadsheet. \n\nLiving in a capitalist world really feels like a game of thrones survival realm where those able to lie, manipulate, convince, persuade, compel, extract, exploit, cheat, and defraud are the winners and actually reaps all the rewards for this behavior. \n\nI hate it here.\n\n",

The first is the trend for the last ~40 years, but that has really picked up speed in the last decade or so, of corporations telling us (this started with women and things like douche and feminine wash) that the natural human body is gross and needs what are often harmful chemicals to be acceptable to society. It's so toxic and now they've really looped men in, which the feminist in me is like, \"About time\", but the Anthropologist in me is saying, this is bs pheromones are actually a thing. What if being drawn to a particular perfume causes us to choose mates with very poor qualities just because their perfume is attractive to us? The second thing goes hand in hand w the other actually. I'll preface with the fact that I think celebrity worship is extremely problematic. Not just the worship of actors and musicians, but all people that attain fame including politicians, people who are on reality shows, social media influencers, etc. US citizens put too much stock in these people, whether that is assuming because they are aesthetically pleasing, or wealthy then they must also be kind, generous, intelligent, etc. Then advertising companies hire these people to sell you all kinds of sh*t that they likely wouldn't be caught dead using, and we go out and spend so much money that we make it profitable for the corporations to do this.

I won't name which one, but I'm sure most of you might guess. Its the one that has all the different colored cards based on spending limit, blue for normal people, gold for slightly wealthier people, black for very wealthy people.\n\nAfter doing a couple commercials that aired on TV, I got hired to work on a pitch for them, a product that hadn't been released yet. Sticking to their colors theme, this was a credit card they planned to call \"\"mint\". \n\nIt was intended to be marketed toward high school and college kids 18-22. Now, this was around 2007-2008, and I'm sure there are some of you who are old enough to remember that \"mint\" was what the cool kids were calling all the cool things about 10 years prior to this.\n\nSo, not only was this company attempting to prey on young kids and their inexperience with credit, they were doing so with a campaign that was a decade out of touch with kids at the time.\n\nAnd the content of the commercial was equally infuriating. I had to model and animate this young \"urban\" kid (from the illustrations I was given as reference, it was hard to tell if he was black or hispanic, so the producers just kept calling him \"urban\") walking through this giant apartment, looking around and nodding his head like he was gonna pay for it with his mint card.\n\nThankfully, this was never actually released as a product. I have no idea if someone at this company called out how fucked up the entire thing was, or it was some other, nameless reason why it died as a pitch. But I was really happy it didn't get released.\n\nI still got paid for the work I did, but it was the one moment that really made me feel disgusted working in advertising. A few years later I switched to working on kids cartoons and I've never felt bad about my work since.",
