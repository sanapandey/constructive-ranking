Our goal is the destruction of capitalism, the toppling of political systems that support and facilitate it, the subjugation of the bourgeoisie and the creation of worker liberation.  \n\nThe graphic below shows rather clearly what Marx means when he discussed the theft of surplus value created by workers.  gap between the purple line and green line is the value workers created by their brain and muscle power but did not receive.  This \"corporate profit\" is really STOLEN WEALTH.  \n\nIn the end, workers created 50-100 TRILLION $ of wealth over the past 50 years and have gotten basically fuck all of it.  Capitalism means immiseration for the masses and nothing else.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxo4ev5o53le1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9c6ad9e05a94ca71a164ae7fd7e75dbbef854dc",
