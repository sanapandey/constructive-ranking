That\u2019s a pretty big feat  getting to that position as takes serious time and skill, not something casual players can do \n\nThen he live-streamed himself playing\u2026 and it was immediately obvious to anyone who knows the game that he wasn\u2019t nearly as good as he claimed. His moves didn\u2019t line up with what you\u2019d expect from a high-level player.\n\nTurns out, he straight-up paid other people to grind for him.\n\nLike, imagine being a multi-billionaire celebrity in your 50s and pulling something like that. That\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019d expect from insecure teenagers trying to impress their friends.\n\nDude just radiates a superiority complex, desperate for people to think how good he is.\n\nIt doesn't help that he has an army of fans  that also  think this",
