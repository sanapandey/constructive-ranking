But your publisher certainly is, and you're only getting paid what you are from the surplus value that *they* extract from their workers on your behalf.\n\nThis is not to slam writers, or any other artisans, or for that matter any of the petite-bourgeoisie who aren't assholes (which, obviously, is an enormous caveat because many of them are). We say \"there's no ethical consumption under capitalism\" and this is true. I think it's equally true that there is no ethical production, either. Our economic activity is so intertwined that if you're making out well, it is certainly at least to some degree at the expense of someone who isn't. You can't escape it.\n\ne: Maybe this is something where a difference in quantity becomes a difference in quality, though. I'm open to that sort of rebuttal to my argument here, now that I think about it.",

As an individual he seems\u2026 fine, but he didn\u2019t single-handedly  create valve, and he certainly doesn\u2019t do all the work that keeps valve running today. In fact valve as a company is a good example of how the owners of capital extract surplus value from the workers who create it. A large portion of valves income comes from the 30% they charge on every purchase on steam, which, simplifying a bit, is surplus value being extracted from the artists and designers that create the game. \n\nOn top of that, valve has many employees, something like 400 or so, who do the actual labor that creates the products and services which Gabe profits from. Now compared to your average company I\u2019m confident that valve employees are paid comparatively extremely well, but the fact that Gabe is himself a multibillionaire shows that there is surplus value being extracted that those employees have generated. \n\nAgain that being said Gabe does seem like one of the more human billionaires, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he did not become one through his own labor value.",
