People for example would always remark on well I expressed myself-- but I didn't do so any better than anyone else around me-- it's just that I happened to be black.\n\n*You express yourself well \\[for a black guy\\]* That was the implicit notion... when it wasn't said explicitly.\n\nMy first girlfriend, whose dad didn't like me because of my skin color, said:\n\n\"Well I don't get it anyway, I mean you're so well spoken I've never even thought of you as being black.\" I realized that this was supposed to have been a compliment.\n\n\"one of the good ones\" I guess.\n\nGrowing up black in white spaces there was weird looks, odd questions, being constantly singled out, being asked constantly why I was in places, who I was with; it was endless harmless jokes-- even on the part of well-meaning people.\n\nFor a good while there I hated my skin. I didn't want to be bothered with it. I saw it as this whole extra thing I had to endure and to situate myself toward. There's a lot of baggage that comes along with being black in the US. And I didn't wanna be a \"black\" guy, I just wanted to be a guy.\n\nThe bit people don't seem to get is that it's not just the odd notions, implicit or otherwise, people hold about you, it's the headspace it puts you in, constantly wondering how much-- or whether or not-- your skin is playing a role in the interactions you have there.\n\nThis is all why I had to leave. Racism exists everywhere, it's true; I like to think of it coming in \"flavors\", but 'murican has to be my least favorite flavor. Here-- I live in a medium-sized western EU country-- it just doesn't hit the same way.",

Still scared and avoid contact to outsiders. And worst part of it because sometimes they cant even meet another member of their tribes, they do inbreeding\n\nNot to mention unwritten genocide (if you go to eastern islands, you often find story about how this island have population but now empty because of dutch) and removal culture (papuan islamic sultanate almost lost and indonesian naval culture already nonexistent. Even nobody think that madagascar is from indonedia until scientist rediscover that by checking their dna)\n\nWell... Tldr: dutch is racist genocidal maniacs",
