Everyone here is trying to accomplish exactly what you're trying to accomplish. But instead of trying to come up with new tools for folks to mobilize and organize against the oligarchy you're sitting here trying to talk people out of using the tools they have available.\n\n\nYou're hustling backwards.

You gotta have a venue, an organization, and a common cause to build up class power towards more revolutionary action. Since socialism is based on working class power, unions are a good starting point. Other types of social organizations, such as tenant advocacy, student groups, prisoner advocacy, food kitchens, disaster relief, etc. are also good places for socialist political parties to serve the masses.\n\n\nOf course it's important to guard against opportunist unionist types who just want a bigger cut of the imperial booty. The sad reality in the imperial core is that more often than not these opportunists will infiltrate key positions in labor organisations because they will likely receive less persecution from law enforcement, and might even get bribes and kickbacks.",

We need those things to survive and we need to work to get those things.\n\nUnionizing is a strategy that exists entirely within capitalism because it's a strategy that's used by people stuck in capitalism. You're apparently living outside of capitalism and wondering why everyone else isn't acting like you are. But unions are locked into a very simply conflict. Management represents the interests of owners and Unions represent the interests of labor. That's it. That is a very simple conflict involving 3 groups of people. Unions, Management and The Ownership-class. If you can't look at the conflict and identify the unions as the good guy and find some way to support them rhetorically, then you're simply not interested in helping labor gain ground.\n\nDo you have a family to support? Personally, I'm a single 41 year old dude in a big city. My life is real simple. If I can pay the rent and save a little money each month then I'm doing alright. I don't have to compromise anything I believe in to support this life style. But if I had a to house, cloth and feed a child then I would have to make very different decisions, I would have to double or triple my income. I would have to exist more fully within capitalism in order to generate the resources required to shield my child from capitalism's destructive grasp.",
