Judaism mandates the loyalty of a Jew to his people and to the Land of Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing Jews to serve within the ADF must come with an understanding that the Jew will have a level of loyalty for the Jewish Nation and for \\[the\\] State of Israel.\u201d\n\nHe said if the ADF preferred not to enlist or commission Jews, \u201cit would then be argued that this policy may be discriminatory to the Jewish People\u201d.\n\nHe told the tribunal he only ever joined the community security group \u201cto play a role safeguarding the local community from attacks, so that my children, my family and the broader Jewish community can continue to be a thriving proud Jewish community in Australia, and a community loyal to Australia\u201d.\n\nHe said most Australian Jews do not volunteer to serve in the Australian defence force, but rather the Israel Defense Forces. He said he volunteered to serve in the ADF \u201cas I felt a strong sense of belonging to Australia and I wanted to give back to the country and demonstrate the importance of serving here in Australia as opposed to the IDF\u201d.",
