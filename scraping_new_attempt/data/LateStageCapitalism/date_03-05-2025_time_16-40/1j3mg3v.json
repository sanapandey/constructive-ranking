There's not enough manpower to use even a fifth of that equipment sitting in stockpiles rusting away even if they drafted everyone between 18 and 40, they just want to keep their military complex alive, that's why trump is calling for Europe to increase their \"defense\" budget, now that the war on Ukraine seems to be near to its end, at \"peaceful\" times, they need to find an excuse to keep increasing their profit.",
