It's definitely something that would trigger revolutionary action but I don't think it's a great position for the left to take to want to crash the monetary system when it would very quickly deteriorate material conditions for the working class. I think the left needs to organize their own monetary system to catch the economy when trump crashes everything. People get so scared of money on the left but they don't realize that everyone has to deal with it and it's just a matter of everyone being free to create money and having consus based political processes. Even a sort of centralized group could do this and everyone can be involved in deciding how the monetary system operates",

Taxing money in MMT is to primarily reduce money supply, limiting inflation, which is why it's ridiculous that corporations and the wealthy pay less effective tax than a working person.

I'm sorry, what did you do with the $100 billion dollars you made? That's right, stuffed it in an offshore account. The burden of inflation is disproportionately carried by the working class.",

Theyre not taxing to reduce the money supply for no reason, it serves two purposes, enforce currency and offset inflation. The inflation exists because of the real resource constraints of the economy. If that didn't exist changing the money supply wouldn't do anything. Not sure why you're just restating what I'm saying but less accurate",

What's you are actually arguing for would make us literal debt slaves to the state instead of liberating us from debt\n\nEdit: \nStephanie Kelton has a very good explanation. She emphasis that calling it the national debt obscures what it is for the individual, she instead calls it the national savings, since it is the total amount of savings the American public holds in banks which in turn are held in solvent treasuries which means that all savings anyone has is literally government debt",

Just because the government runs occasional surplus doesn't mean what I'm saying is wrong because when they do we can observe public savings going down. It doesn't completely disappear because a surplus for one fiscal year doesn't offset the rest of the debt",

The savings of Americans (not cash, no idea how to factor that in) can literally been seen in exact amount through every banks balance at the fed. That's how the banking system works. The reason debt created through the banking system isn't shown is because it's not government debt and money from loans does not count because the loan has created a liability for the individual and therefore is not savings on an exact equal basis. Another way to look at it is when a loan goes out it creates another bank deposit which essentially cancels it out. Government deficit is not dependent on issuing a loan to the public first so it creates money that becomes savings for the public.\n\nEdit: sorry I didn't mean crash in the chart for covid it does the opposite",

It's just a way to keep spending in check with the economy. Even though bonds don't have to be issued deficit spending implies a debt but bonds are issued because the government is essentially too lazy to use other means to keep the balance in the money supply and real resources so they issue bonds to offset spending and buy those bonds themselves so they can immediately offset the spending but also have cash on hand since treasury securities are the same as cash in the macro economy",
