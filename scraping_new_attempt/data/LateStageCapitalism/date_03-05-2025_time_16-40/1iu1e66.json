Trump's plan is to sabotage the liberal project (a major part of which are the for-profit wars) on behalf of the capitalist faction that brought him to power. \n\nIn short, Trump achieves two major goals. First, he destroys the liberal project for Ukraine, which is basically the complete looting of the country by the US-Western liberal capitalist faction. Second, he opens widely the road for the Musk-led oligarchy to replace its liberal capitalist rivals in the race for Ukraine's valuable assets.",
