Then this consumerism behaviour serves well for the purpose of the capitalism, which contributes the global warming that caused the crop loss globally that pushed price higher. Not to even mention the labor exploitation in producing this agricultural commodities. Perfect perpetual mechanism.\nNext time your coffee tastes bitter is not because the bean is burnt, it\u2019s because our planet is BURNING.\n\n*wrote this down when I was having the bowel movement thanks to the first sip of the day*",

I can be sitting at a computer working on something and start falling asleep out of boredom no matter how well I slept the night before. So not coffee, but kinda similar situation. Idk what I\u2019m going to do! Coffee is too expensive (but I love it.)",

I\u2019ve called so many pharmacies. There are so many pharmacies in NYC, you would think one would have some in stock but I can\u2019t dial every single pharmacy in New York lol. I only take 10mg, I\u2019m a fairly petite woman. I need it though. Irritating AF. It regulates my sleep, keeps my emotional dysregulation in check for the most part, etc. I take strattera too, which helps with some of it, but I am struggling. It is so crazy that they can\u2019t make sure it\u2019s available.",

And yes - i feel like the adderall is a miracle mood stabilizer for me more than a \u201cget things done\u201d thing. Off the meds the absolute smallest thing will make me furious to the point i\u2019m sputtering and can\u2019t even describe my anger to then just slumping into a deep despair and wanting to take a ride on the ol\u2019 sewer slide. I was able to fill the 20\u2019s and 10\u2019s last week, but my pharmacy didn\u2019t have any 30\u2019s and said they didn\u2019t know when they were going to get more. My doctor wrote another prescription and sent it to someplace called \u201cPharmacy Advantage\u201d (i think) and apparently not only do they have the 30\u2019s but i guess they\u2019re going to fedex them to my door???? We\u2019ll see. They\u2019re supposed to arrive sometime Tuesday. \n\nWhat does the strattera do for you that the adderall doesn\u2019t?",

I used to be super physically hyperactive and impulsive and the strattera has been such an excellent block for that (the way I drove and was constantly getting injured in my teens / injured as a kid when I was undiagnosed was insane)  - I would say it\u2019s one of the few medications I\u2019ve taken where I don\u2019t even feel like I\u2019m on a medication, it\u2019s so subtle but makes such a huge difference. The adderall helps a lot in the way you described, with emotional regulation, also just makes me feel more calm and focused which is obviously ideal. \n\nI\u2019ve been taking both for about 11 years now (though I took a break from adderall when I was depressed my senior year of college. I remember my doctor called my parents concerned bc I stopped picking up my prescriptions lol.) \n\nI get the same furiousness you\u2019re describing! It helps so much with that. It sucks that we have to live like this. It\u2019s so hard when something that in the grand scheme of things shouldn\u2019t cause a meltdown but it does because\u2026 we\u2019re adhd. That sounds promising, I hope you get them.",
