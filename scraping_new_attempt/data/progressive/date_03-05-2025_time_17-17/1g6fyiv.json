Ron DeSantis and allies in his administration have undertaken a robust effort to build opposition to an amendment on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution and undo a pinnacle piece of legislation he signed into law.\n\n> In recent weeks, one state agency launched a website attacking the ballot measure, another state agency threatened local television stations that had run an ad supporting it, and an election police unit created by DeSantis started investigating claims of fraud in the signature-gathering process for it months after it was approved for the ballot.\n\n> DeSantis\u2019 critics [argue] that using government resources to wade into a political fight is unethical and illegal.",
