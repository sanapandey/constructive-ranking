Cool cool cool. Cool cool cool cool cool. Super glad she stuck it out for those last seven years in her 80s.\n\nJust like with Dianne Feinstein, who could have also retired at 80 in 2013 (or more reasonably stepped back from running again in 2012) retiring at 79 instead of holding on until her death at 90.\n\nAnd I\u2019m super excited that Mitch McConnell keeps voting in the Senate while holding onto the podium with increasingly bewildered silence at age 81 after several concerning medical incidents, maintaining his seat due to the momentum of party affiliation and name recognition alone. \n\nThis gerontocracy is just working out gangbusters for us!",

However,  even if she'd perfectly timed her retirement to the political process she was *supposed* to be above, that would still give us a hyper conservative 5/4 court.\n\nDespite that, *certain* accounts treat her as the single, go-to scapegoat for the current state of the Supreme Court, because any alternative stands too much of a chance of firing up progressives to, y'know, vote.",
