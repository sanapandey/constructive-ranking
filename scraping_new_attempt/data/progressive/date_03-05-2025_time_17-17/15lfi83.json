While technically true, anyone in her position of power and anyone with any level of competency would have done the same thing. She's not special for doing the right thing or the normal thing given what Trump (a former president did).",

It's Nancy fuckin Pelosi. She didn't see any long game here. She can't see anything past her nose as most of her career reflects in missed opportunity after missed opportunity for meaningful progress and the ones she takes advantage of are to preserve her power and the power of her in group colleagues. You can't be this naive my guy.",

She's directly manipulating Feinsteine's senate replacement process in hopes of not getting a more progressive candidate in that senate seat. \n2. For no reasonable reason she chose to hop over to Taiwan and raise the stakes in that conflict when she was just a house majority leader. What business did she have injecting herself into that issue?\n3. She supports Israel and it's apartheid govt. \n4. She's done speech after speech saying she believe we need a 'strong republican party' which if that's her take in today's America, you're self reporting your ineptitude and bias towards neoliberalism. \n5. She's cool with insider trading for elected politicians. Par for the course there lol.\n6. She's admitted she knew Bush was lying about Iraq back in the day. We all knew most of the higher up politicians likely knew the truth about WMD's and Iraq but she outright mask offed herself. Guess we can thank her for her 20 year late transparency. \n7. And the last one off the top of my head is her failed leadership or lack thereof when over 1000 state house and Senate seats were lost to republicans over her time as speaker under Obama. That was a choice she and other dem leaders made that imo directly led to trump and many other supreme court cases or ridiculous and extreme state laws etc that we are seeing today. \n\nThat enough for you my silly friend?",

So no wonder you hate Pelosi, you have to lie.\n\n>She's directly manipulating Feinsteine's senate replacement process in hopes of not getting a more progressive candidate in that senate seat.\n\nThis is made up crap that doesn't have any evidence at all.\n\n>For no reasonable reason she chose to hop over to Taiwan and raise the stakes in that conflict when she was just a house majority leader. What business did she have injecting herself into that issue?\n\nIt isn't an issue at all you apologist for a genocidal dictatorship. Who cares what China thinks? Pelosi didn't break US policy on strategic ambiguity. She just met with Tawian's own politicians.\n\n>She supports Israel and it's apartheid govt.\n\nShe has been critical of Israel all the time. Or should she not insert herself in foreign issues?\n\n>She's done speech after speech saying she believe we need a 'strong republican party' which if that's her take in today's America, you're self reporting your ineptitude and bias towards neoliberalism.\n\nShe gave one speech that said the Republican party would be better for America if it wasn't literally a fascist party.\n\nYou don't even know what neoliberalism means. If you did, you wouldn't make up crap.\n\n>She's cool with insider trading for elected politicians. Par for the course there lol.\n\nShe literally authored a bill to stop elected officials from trading but continue to make up crap I guess.\n\nShe's admitted she knew Bush was lying about Iraq back in the day. We all knew most of the higher up politicians likely knew the truth about WMD's and Iraq but she outright mask offed herself. Guess we can thank her for her 20 year late transparency.\n\nWhat are you even talking about?\n\n>And the last one off the top of my head is her failed leadership or lack thereof when over 1000 state house and Senate seats were lost to republicans over her time as speaker under Obama. That was a choice she and other dem leaders made that imo directly led to trump and many other supreme court cases or ridiculous and extreme state laws etc that we are seeing today.\n\nDemocrats lost seats because they passed the ACA and America hated that poor people were getting free healthcare. States were Republicans gained the most were the same states that denied FREE money from the federal governement for Medicaid.\n\nContinue to blame someone who got tens of millions of poor people free healthcare for the first time, instead of fascists though, very progressive of you!\n\nAnything else? Still waiting on literally one thing that isn't made up garbage.",
