Trump leading Biden by 25 points on who\u2019s more \u201ccompetent\u201d, is not a believable number. I believe Biden is going to win easily and pollsters are going to need to reassess their methodologies after November.",

Trump is still yelling at his rallies and, since he hasn\u2019t been convicted of anything since his presidency, gives the appearance of being a victim. That\u2019s going to rile up his base.\n\nDon\u2019t forget; [Everyone thought Hillary had the presidency in the bag\u2026](https://youtu.be/-nQGBZQrtT0?si=eyn9srbOk0WUpIRZ&t=3m)",

                            "body": "I\u2019m well aware of what happened with Hillary. She also won the popular vote. Trump was far less known and disliked then.\n\nTrump has openly been deteriorating for the past year. He\u2019s been charged with something like 90 felonies. He\u2019s failed to expand his base of support at all. It\u2019s clear he has a high floor of support as always. But to think he\u2019d grow his support by being out of power, charged with many crimes, found liable for rape? There is no way he has grown his appeal with the overall electorate.\n\nBiden\u2019s got all the challenges of incumbency plus old age. Those always drag a candidate down, he\u2019s not unusual in that regard so it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll lose some support. On the other hand, Trump has a unique effect of rallying independent to vote AGAINST him. Nobody loves Biden (never did-he\u2019s a compromise candidate) but people don\u2019t have reason to hate him.\n\nThe best version of Trump we\u2019ve ever seen lost the popular vote to Hillary, who was a terrible candidate that animated a huge number of voters to dislike her. Biden beat Trump by a wider margin in the popular vote and easily win the EC. I do not see any universe where that trend reverses in 2024. Biden is Biden. He has a strong record to run on. Trump is the worst version of himself we\u2019ve ever seen. It makes no sense to think the electorate is changing direction in this way.\n\nPolling is also worse now. It\u2019s become common to see low-value polls get blasted into headlines to keep the horse race coverage going, but they are often divergent or wildly off. It\u2019s clear that the parties are even promoting obscure polls just to keep their narratives going.\n\nFinally, polls have misjudged the electorate a lot in recent years, especially since the Dobbs decision. Unlike in 2020, half the population has a massive personal reason to vote against republican politicians both locally and nationally. There is a large and growing gender gap that favors Democrats and they\u2019ve been cashing in on it in every election for a couple years now.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think these polls are way off. Biden will expand his margin of victory this time around.",
