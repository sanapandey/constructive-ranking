                    "body": ">The Washington Post reported that \"it was not clear from court records what collateral Trump presented to obtain the bond from Chubb.\"\n\nSo we do know that Chubb paid the bond. Chubb is basically an insurance company headquartered in Switzerland. And that Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg [served on a trade advisory committee](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-e-jean-carroll-evan-greenberg/) in the Trump White House.\n\n>The environmental nonprofit group Rainforest Action Network (RAN) [noted on its website](https://www.ran.org/the-understory/chubb-is-insuring-deadly-oil-and-gas-expansion/) that Chubb does business around the world, including with several major American adversaries. The group pointed out that Chubb is \"insuring oil and gas extraction and transport in Russia, fueling Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.\"\n\nObviously RAN is an activist organization with their own agenda. But their information on Chubb operations in Russia, and elsewhere, is sound. So the headline term \"Putin aligned\" may imply, on its own, misleading context the claim itself appears essentially valid given that context. And the article has in fact provided sufficient sources for that context.\n\nWhat the article doesn't have sufficient information to determine is whether Chubb acted for the sake of its own activism or was in fact merely a conduit for the activism of others, such as Russia. Yet the Putin \"aligned\" characterization remains valid, with sufficient sources, on its own.",
