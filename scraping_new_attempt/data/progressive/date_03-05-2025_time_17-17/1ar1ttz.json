I had a surgery I finally was able to get approved and scheduled for March 6th . . . I had to cancel. It was scheduled back in early January and I had been trying to get into the specialist for over 6 months before that. I'm so upset. I'm able to get health insurance through the marketplace that won't cost us monthly, but now I have deductibles, co-pays, etc which means I can't afford my surgery anyway and won't be able to continue working with my specialists.
