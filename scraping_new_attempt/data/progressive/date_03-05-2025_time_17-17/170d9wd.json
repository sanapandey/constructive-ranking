            "body": "Wild rumors? \n\n>Mullin began by complaining to congressional reporter Manu Raju that after the allegation that Gaetz had had sex with a 17-year-old girl became known in early 2021, \u201cthe media didn\u2019t give \\[him\\] the time of day.\u201d  \n\n\nThat's not a rumor, that's an investigation.  \n\n>That allegation, which Gaetz has denied, spurred an investigation by the Department of Justice, which in February *opted not to file charges*. A House Ethics Committee investigation into that matter, as well as illicit drug use and bribery, among other things, is ongoing.\n\nI should point out, he wasn't picking up a 17-year-old prostitute by himself.  He was with another guy. And that guy has already been charged, prosecuted, and convicted. They've simply decided to ***not file charges*** against Matt. Because he's a very special man who doesn't need to obey the law.",
