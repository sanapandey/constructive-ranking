Insurers say the process helps them control costs by preventing medically unnecessary care. But patients say the often time-consuming and frustrating rules create hurdles that delay or deny access to the treatments they need. In some cases, delays and denials equal death, doctors say.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why desperate patients like Nix \u2014 and even some physicians \u2014 say they have turned to publicly shaming insurance companies on social media to get tests, drugs, and treatments approved.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this has become a routine practice for us to resort to if we don\u2019t get any headway,\u201d said Dr. Shehzad Saeed, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Dayton\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio. In March, he tweeted a photo of an oozing skin rash, blaming Anthem for denying the biologic treatment his patient needed to ease her Crohn\u2019s disease symptoms.\n\nSnip\n\n\u201cThey take in premiums and don\u2019t pay claims. That\u2019s how they make money,\u201d said Dr. Linda Peeno, a health care consultant and retired Kentucky physician who was employed as a medical reviewer by Humana in the 1980s and later became a whistleblower. \u201cThey just delay and delay and delay until you die. And you\u2019re absolutely helpless as a patient.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to hope things may get marginally better. Some major insurers are voluntarily revamping their prior authorization rules to ease preapproval mandates for doctors and patients. And many states are passing laws to rein in the use of prior authorization.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying we should get rid of it entirely,\u201d said Todd Askew, senior vice president for advocacy at the American Medical Association, in advance of the group\u2019s annual meeting in June. \u201cBut it needs to be right-sized, it needs to be simplified, it needs to be less friction between the patient and accessing their benefits.\u201d\n\nCustomers are increasingly using social media to air their complaints across all industries, and companies are paying attention. Nearly two-thirds of complainants reported receiving some sort of response to their online post, according to the 2023 \u201cNational Consumer Rage Survey,\u201d conducted by Customer Care Measurement & Consulting in collaboration with Arizona State University.\n\n\nSome research suggests companies are better off engaging with unhappy customers offline, rather than responding to public social media posts. But many patients and doctors believe venting online is an effective strategy, though it remains unclear how often this tactic works in reversing prior authorization denials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even a joke. The fact that that\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to get these medications is just sad,\u201d said Dr. Brad Constant, an inflammatory bowel disease specialist who has published research on prior authorization. His work found that prior authorizations are associated with an increased likelihood that children with inflammatory bowel disease will be hospitalized.",
