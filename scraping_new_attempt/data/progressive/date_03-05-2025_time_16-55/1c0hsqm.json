NPR if it incorporated more of Fox News elements still wouldn\u2019t be conservative  enough for many people. Anyone want to bet on how long it will take for Berliner to end up being a talking head on Fox?",

The difference is it didn't tell every single story through the particular identitarian lens that's become all the rage on the left in the last decade. People are asking for that NPR back, not for Fox News elements. \n\nSeriously the world just isn't that simple.",
