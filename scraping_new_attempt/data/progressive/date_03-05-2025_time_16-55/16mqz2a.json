            "body": "I worked for a company that provided mobile dental services to LTC facilities all over the southeast. The model was good- the company had outfitted trailers to be towed to parking lots of facilities loaded with an actual dental office. Residents could be wheeled or walked into the mobile clinics for everything from routine cleanings, extractions, and they even made dentures with state of the art 3D printers. \n\nThe cost was, of course, the biggest hurdle for most patients. Many of them are solely funded by Medicaid, which really only provides a single set of dentures to be used for years- not good, because the mouth in that demographic is constantly shifting and changing due to bone loss and other factors. There was a program where Medicaid beneficiaries could apply for a program that reimbursed them for dental insurance that covered almost everything, but the process was complicated and difficult to understand for residents and their families.",
