If a woman is able to get an abortion due to financial reasons, then a man should be able to waive his child support for that same reason. Men shouldn\u2019t be able to decide whether or not a woman keeps a child, so women shouldn\u2019t be able to force a man to pay for a child he can\u2019t support. Hopefully what I\u2019m trying to say makes sense.",
