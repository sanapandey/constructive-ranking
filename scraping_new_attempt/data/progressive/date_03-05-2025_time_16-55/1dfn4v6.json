They can\u2019t bring it up again ever - they\u2019ve lost every argument on if they have standing. This prevents them from being even able to file suit.\n\nOthers could sue on other grounds like it being a form of abortion, but that\u2019s also settled - nobody has to prescribe. They lack standing in that. Plus, they can\u2019t challenge general policy on the same grounds of having no standing.",
