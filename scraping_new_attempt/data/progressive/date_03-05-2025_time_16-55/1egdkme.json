Aren't there tiny houses sitting empty or something (or so I saw in the Internet)? Shouldn't the create encampments with facilities, at the very least? What is the effing plan? I was thinking of a protest: homeless people stand at bus stops, wait until the need sleep, then sleep standing up until they fall down.",

Whether you use it to criminalize or help the homeless is directly related to the level of compassion you are bringing to the approach. \n\nBefore they were allowed to deny care. Now we have the tools to say \u201cif you continue to camp in this area we will bring you into a system that\u2019s going to address your immediate medical/rehab needs, government forms assistance, and provide temporary housing. None of which will go on any criminal record.\n\nAlso I\u2019m not saying the way SF is going to about it is the best, just that we as progressives and can make actual progress with this ruling.",
