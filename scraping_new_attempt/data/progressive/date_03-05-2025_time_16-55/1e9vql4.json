Who is more important for human existence? As beneficial as it may be to have doctors, cops, teachers, pilots, etc. None of them are essential. \n\nPersonally, I respect anyone that dedicates their entire life to something. Doesn't really even matter what it is they're doing. It's not something they clock in and out of 40 hrs/wk 48 times/yr. But especially as it to pertains farmers. There are far more lucrative professions that require much less work. I admire farmers for living a life full of struggle 365 days/yr, for the most part. Just so the rest of civilization can live, regardless of how ungrateful it may be.",
