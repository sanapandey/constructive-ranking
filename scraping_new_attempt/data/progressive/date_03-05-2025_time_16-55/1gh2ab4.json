Make the majority of the lands a reservation, modeled on Native American reservations, upon which they can own land by their traditions, and make just the areas owned by non natives outside the reservation. \n\nAlternatively, surely the French came up with a solution, for the other portion of Samoa. Model on that.\n\nAnyhow, since a state has mutual sovereignty, I imagine there is a way to enshrine their customs in state law. I don't think this is an absolute roadblock.",
