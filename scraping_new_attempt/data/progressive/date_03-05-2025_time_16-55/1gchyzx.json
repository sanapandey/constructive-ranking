            "body": "Agreed. My late father was a gun nut. He owned 37 of them when he died. He smuggled two loaded derringers into the hospital on one of his many trips there in his final days. My mother found them before he shot himself or someone at the hospital. When he died we had three illegal weapons to get rid of, two sawed off shotguns and an AK 47 style rifle that he had converted to an automatic weapon with a kit from a gun show. He didn\u2019t shoot it that much it was just too expensive to go through so many bullets so fast. I shot it once. My father also collected salt and pepper shakers. He had hundreds of them. They were all cheap things he picked up at garage sales and thrift stores. There was some sort of obsessive compulsive thing going on with him.\n\nI think the key to gun control in America is to forget about the guns and make it hard to get bullets. Sure some people will make their own but most won\u2019t. Make the ingredients to make them controlled substances. Make them expensive. It won\u2019t stop every gun death in America but it would go a long way in reducing the number of deaths.",

Men, we need to control the bullets, that\u2019s right. I think all bullets should cost five thousand dollars\u2026 five thousand dollars per bullet\u2026 You know why? Cause if a bullet cost five thousand dollars there would be no more innocent bystanders.\nYeah! Every time somebody get shot we\u2019d say, \u2018Damn, he must have done something ... Shit, he\u2019s got fifty thousand dollars worth of bullets in his ass.\u2019\nAnd people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost five thousand dollars. \u2018Man I would blow your fucking head off\u2026if I could afford it.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m gonna get me another job, I\u2019m going to start saving some money, and you\u2019re a dead man. You\u2019d better hope I can\u2019t get no bullets on layaway.\u2019\nSo even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you wouldn't have to go to no doctor to get it taken out. Whoever shot you would take their bullet back, like \"I believe you got my property.",
