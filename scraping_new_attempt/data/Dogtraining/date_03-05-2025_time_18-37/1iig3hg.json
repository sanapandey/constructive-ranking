    "selftext": "In looking to get a dog, probably a border collie, and I want to bring it with me at work( I work in forestry so always walking most of the time alone in the woods) but Im not sure how to make the transition from : getting the dog, teaching the dog to come, and bring him to work with me witouth always searching for him. It it okay to leave him alone while i go to work during the first couple weeks to make sure he is ready to come with me at work? I plan to do big walk in the mourning and in the night with him  (+-1h) hope you understand, english is not my first language! TIA",

Reward and train that heavily, and manage through the older puppy/teenage exploratory phase with excellent long line skills and you can get a much more reliable recall and off leash radius skills with a lot less effort than starting from scratch with an adult. \n\nOp needs to think long and hard about what their plan is going to be while skills are being built. Is their job flexible enough to deal with the needs of a puppy (shorter walks, pen time, crate time and teaching time)? Can pup go to day training (not a common offering but a great option for a situation like this)? Can they accommodate an older dog who can maybe be left alone longer but may need more remedial training and management of reactivity (borders in particular are prone to behavioral fallout from being in rescue).\n\nI disagree with the commenters saying don\u2019t get a bc. BCs live to put on miles with their handlers and feel like a team, especially in uncrowded areas and I think this could be a perfect home. Op just really needs to examine their resources and make a plan for how to manage before pup is trained enough that op can focus solely on their job for long periods of time.",

They need extra attention to socializing as well which op might have trouble doing. \n\nOn the other hand BCs in particular are prone to emotional fallout from rescue, and it\u2019s a bit more work to instill off leash skills in an adult than an itty bitty baby. \n\nHonestly from what I know about forestry work winter seems to generally be a lower stress/lower miles/more flexible time of year.

When my young dogs are loose I'm actively keeping an eye on them as much as possible. Dogs that are older (like 4+) tend to be more reliable and can (with a solid training relationship) be trusted to stay by you and recall consistently in an outdoor setting with tons of wildlife.  I wouldn't put a 1-2 year old adolescent dog in that position bc it's setting them up to fail.\n I'd keep them on leash until you're so confident in their recall that you'd bet $5000 on it (because that's what a potential vet bill costs if they come across a bear or rattle snake or something like that).\n\nIn the meantime, as long as it's not a young puppy and you're walking them before and after work and spending time on training 3-4 days a week or more, they're most likely happy staying home while you work.  I don't think that's the best life for a border collie specifically but a lab or retriever is probably fine. \n\nYou may need to consider the possibility that the dog needs more than that, and be prepared to hire a dog walker if you can't come home mid day. A border collie almost certainly needs more interaction than that so I would for sure budget for a dog walker if you go that route. Sometimes dogs don't become what we hoped, so it's possible you'll end up with a napping-by-the-fireplace dog or a super reactive dog. But there's a good chance most dogs would be really happy being a long-walks-in-the-woods dog.",

Possibly a rescue, but there's also a risk that a rescue could come with a variety of fear-based undesirable behaviors resulting from past trauma (common in rescues) that have to be carefully managed for months while you work to desensitize them. Amidst all the romance and feel-good of rescuing an unfortunate dog, that's a thing with rescues that many people don't realize.\n\nDefinitely avoid getting a puppy, under a year old. Puppies need far more continuous or near-continuous attention than a household where all members are gone for most of the day can provide.\n\nRecall is something that takes time to develop, from weeks to months, depending on how fast the dog is willing to progress. You have to start in the house in a situation with minimal distraction for the dog, and gradually add in distractions and temptations - food, toys, other household members, views outdoors (of maybe critters in the yard), etc. Only after he has mastered this can you start working on it outside, on a long leash, of course (30 ft / 10m), again in a minimally distracting situation at first and gradually working your way up.\n\nAside from recall, to be safe loose in the forest, your dog also needs to be trained to control emotional reactivity to look to you for guidance and avoid potentially running off after something that momentarily excites him and then not being able to figure out how to return to you. No amount of recall training will help you if your dog uncontrollably bolts after every chipmunk he comes across in the woods.\n\nThe forest, despite being safer from road traffic than a sidewalk, is one of the most distracting places the dog could ever be in, with an overwhelming amount of scents, trails, scuttling in the distance, and all sorts of other things vying for his attention. There's also the matter of whether your dog is properly socialized in the forest; for example, a dog that doesn't know not to harass a porcupine can quickly get himself into trouble, right? Maybe once you're confident in his recall in your yard, or on a quiet neighborhood walk, you can try taking him for a hike, but keeping him on the long leash (30 ft / 10m) to ensure he doesn't run off after something that momentarily grabs his attention and then doesn't know how to find his way back. When you can do that a few times, you should be able to judge for yourself how well he'll do in the woods with you without a leash.\n\nGood luck!",
