    "selftext": "My 3 yr old aussie stopped responding to the command \"come\" a while ago. He use to respond, and now he just sits there and stares at me like I'm stupid or like he's waiting for me to say something else. We tried \"touch\" where he has to come and touch your hand. It worked for a while but he stopped that too. He will \"touch\" if you have a treat in your hand. I have no idea how to reinforce \"come\" or \"touch\" with no treat. No clue why would would just stop that when he listens to all other commands just fine.",

Well, if you stopped reinforcing, he\u2019s gonna be pretty clever and figure when it is and isn\u2019t worth it to come!\n\nYou need to go back to giving treats 100% of the time until he stops checking whether you obviously have a treat or not. Then you need to have treats both in your hand *and* somewhere nearby (like a bowl or a jacket pocket, make the non-hand treat way better than the hand one) and practice giving him the non-hand treat instead of the one in your hand so he realises that the treat in your hand is *not* linked to what he\u2019s actually getting. Then what you do is stash treats around the environment ahead of time (easier at home, but do it sometimes outside as well), ask him to come with *no* treat in your hand from a super short easy distance, and when he does he gets the hidden environment treat. But the most important thing is to always reinforce the recall. Even if you don\u2019t have a treat with you, immediately starting a great game can tide you over.",

I guess maybe he remembered he used to get a treat and is basically like \"I'm not doing it without a treat anymore.\" It's just confusing because he will react to touch at times, but it makes sense compared to what you said, because it is short distances. \n\nThanks for the advice! I never knew you should offer a non-treat hand!",
