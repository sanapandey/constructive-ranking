    "selftext": "We\u2019ve recently had our dog sitter (who has sat for us several times) start walking our dog Mars twice a week during the afternoons and from everything I know and can tell, she is a great sitter/walker. However I now have her walking Mars twice a week (while I\u2019m at the office) and almost every time the dog walker comes, Mars pees a little. It looks like more of a submissive or pleasing pee (but then she wags her tail and gives her belly when the dog walker enters) - so the dog walker calls her name before entering our apartment and also gives her treats before and after the walk. Anyone else deal with this? Will she stop this after enough time? What are some tips that I may not be thinking of? Thanks!",
