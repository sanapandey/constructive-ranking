I learned this going through a leash reactivity course, turns out I was tensing up when we would pass other dogs which is super easy for them to pick up on. you should try training him. go to a class or take him to a specific trainer, have someone come to your house and show you how to handle your dog. Also this post is just so off putting you shouldn\u2019t talk about this in real life. It\u2019s lowkey pretty obvious you\u2019re the one who is scared of \u201cpoor people\u201d. it reads like you want someone to say a poor person beat him up and that\u2019s why he\u2019s scared. it\u2019s not. obvious answer is to just train him can\u2019t believe you needed to post on Reddit to figure that out",

Consult your vet - medication is good for this dog, especially given other issues you mentioned. Then hire a trainer with proper certifications (see the wiki for what to look for in a trainer). \n\nIt sounds like your dog is uncomfortable around people in general. And I get the feeling that you're uncomfortable about people you perceive as \"poor\", and your dog is picking up on that.",
