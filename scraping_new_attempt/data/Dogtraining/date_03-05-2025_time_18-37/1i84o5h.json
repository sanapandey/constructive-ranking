    "selftext": "About a week ago I got my adoptive pup from a shelter in Romania. He\u2019s around 5\u20136 months old, and as you can imagine, it\u2019s been a huge adjustment for him. Just the car ride for him och was 27 hours.\n\nHe\u2019s very scared of going outside. Every time we try to take him out, he freezes and refuses to walk. I\u2019ve had to carry him out, but once we\u2019re outside, he whines and immediately tries to run back home. Even if we manage to stay out for a minute, the tiniest sound will set him off. I\u2019ve tried everything\u2014treats, taking small steps, standing still to help him acclimate\u2014but nothing seems to work.\n\nWhen we do get back home, he ends up using the puppy pads to do his business, as he\u2019s too scared to go outside. It breaks my heart to see him so frightened. I live in a relatively noisy area, which I\u2019m sure doesn\u2019t help his anxiety.\n\nDoes anyone have advice or tips to help him feel more comfortable and confident outside?",
