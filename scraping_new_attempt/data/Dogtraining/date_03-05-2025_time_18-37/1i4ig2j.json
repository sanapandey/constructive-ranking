During the latest 'attack' time both of them looked like they were biting each other's snouts (it's possible older dog also tried to grab the new one by his throat, I was panicking so I'm not sure). Neither seem to have gotten hurt, it was an aggressive attack though, not a playtime attack. \n\nRight now they're both sleeping on the same bed, but one at the head and one at the feet (in my parent's bedroom). \n\nWould it be counter productive to have one of them in a cage? I worry that whichever dog is locked up would feel neglected. The new one especially starts whining if he's alone. Furthermore, how can we introduce the cage in a positive way? We want them feeling safe in the cage, not punished. \n\nThey're both roughly the same height, one is a 10 year old 5kg brown/black Yorkshire, the other is 2 year old 2kg black Yorkshire terrier. ",

It's basically a playpen, the top is open, sides have a fence and one side has a door that can open. We were going to put the new dog in it when all of us leave the house.\n\nAs for why the attacks are happening, 2 were because of treats, one I'm not sure why as I wasn't near but it was when father tried to take both for a walk.\n\nThey're not really interacting with each other, old one sometimes goes to smell the new one, but new one is just kinda sad, all he does is sleep. He's very very calm, behaviour wise it's honestly as if the old one is young, and young one is old.\n\nNew one is ignoring all toys, even the one he brought with. He's not playing at all. Older one is, but by himself. So there's no need to take away any high value toys.",

If we call both dogs and new one comes too, old one sometimes jumps at him. The confusing part is that when old one sleeps, it can be on the same (human) bed, he can still show his back to the new dog. How can he trust him one moment and then attack him?",

That's pretty open and closed -resource guarding.  One of the dogs is assuming the other is trying to get at what they have identified as theirs.\n\nBelieve me, I have two Huskys who are bonded but still young and learning.  One has shown aggression if they feel the other is coming after food or treats they deem as their own.  It's like an imaginary circle and once whomever is in it -the alarm goes off.",

He needs lots of guidance and boundaries. And for this reason, a playpen for the dog is a good idea. It also gives the other dog a break. You also should be taking your new dog to the vet ASAP. Your vet will want to make sure your dog is up to date on all vaccinations and doesn't have any parasites or other concerns.  Overall, the dog may just be sleepy because for the first time in a long time it's in a home instead of in a kennel (I'm assuming that quite possibly it came from a group situation and it was not very peaceful)",

So I suspect neither the 10-year-old nor the 2-year-old have been encouraged to have good manners and sit for treats. However, from your description, it sounds to me more like two dogs that don't know how to play with each other very well, not an attack. Attack. The fact that the dogs will sleep on the same bed together tells me this is most likely very rough, but play.  \n\nI would suggest talking to a trainer about teaching your dog some basic manners and cues. Like sit for treats.  Sitting and waiting before they get their meals and so on.  Crates are not a bad thing. Sometimes a dog likes a little peace and quiet without being bothered by a younger and more energetic dog. For this reason, your older dog might appreciate a crate of his own and during that time exclude the 2-year-old from bothering him.",

If he's getting up go after the younger one, his sit is not Rock solid. Back to kindergarten level training. And train a 'place' cue.  Each dog has to sit on their own spot. You can use a placemat or a bath mat since they're tiny dogs. If they're not on their spot they don't get a treat. If they are not on the spot they don't get released for dinner.  If the older one gets off his mat, no reward, \"place\" \"stay\".  You might find it easier to start training with both dogs on a leash indoors. It makes it a whole lot easier to move the dog back to his place to reinforce and manage the behaviors.",

There\u2019s likely something that is causing stress (invading space, encroaching upon resources like space, food or attention from you). Look up some dog body language and stress signal videos to get an idea or what it looks like when a dog is giving clear signals that they want to be left alone or are feeling uncomfortable. Once you familiarize yourself start paying attention to your dogs signals, particularly when they\u2019re in the same room or interacting with each other. It\u2019s likely that there is some attempts at communication that are unsuccessful. \n\nAnd I think it would be a great idea to rotate them in and out of containment whether it\u2019s a crate or baby gate or separate room. That way they can each have one on one attention, especially your older dog who now has to share you and had no say in that but also to build a bond with your new dog. Did the new one come from the shelter or somewhere where he was previously crated? It\u2019s possible he\u2019s already somewhat familiar and comfy in a crate. But I like to start by allowing them to go in and out of the crate as they please, and putting little jackpots of yummies in the crate so it becomes a pleasant place. Once that seems easy you can feed him meals, give him a lick mat with peanut butter, a crunchy edible chew, etc\u2026things that are a bit longer lasting while he\u2019s inside the crate. Then slowly start closing the gate while he\u2019s working on the longer lasting yummy snacks but let them come out when he\u2019s done. Honestly it might be nice for each of them to have a crate to seek refuge if they\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or need to take a break. It\u2019s not mean or punishment, think of it like giving them a safe zone. And a bonus is you can take those safe zone with you wherever if you have to travel with them or board them somewhere they will have a familiar place to rest.",
