    "selftext": "Our dog has started showing weird behaviours throughout the day, if we come down the stairs, move off the sofa or enter a room he will jump up growling/barking and then charge at you before changing his mind and asking for attention or give quick licks at your hands before walking off, if you move again he'll sometimes come straight back barking and do it again, sometimes he'll even run up and place your hand/arm in his mouth while doing this, not bite down but just hold for a quick second before letting go. These aren't his regular friendly/playful grumbles but deep growls and before jumping up will stiffen up and side eye etc. Highly worried that this might be the starting signs of him becoming aggressive and with a child in the house I'm concerned.\n\nHe tends to do this more at night.\n\nHe's some sort of herding mix we rescued when he was 10 weeks old, he's now roughly 10 months old and huge, we've never had a problem with him before and he is otherwise very well trained in his day to day etc\n\n(I have contacted a behaviouralist but they have no space in their schedule for the next 3 months and wanted some opinions etc while we wait for our appointment)",
