    "selftext": "We got a Cockapoo who is 2 years old aprox. 10 weeks ago and she was trained before hand to a level where she can do what's asked but it may take several attempts then trying to teach her things like waiting until she is released to get a dummy and sitting until told she can move she can do with a lead on perfectly but as soon as that lead comes off she wont wait she wont sit until told to leave its like she knows she can run away now and wont get pulled back and she's even started to pull on the lead during lead walking which she had spot on for the last 8 weeks we've had her she also just runs off at any distraction presented and will randomly start ignoring commands that she knows perfectly like the other day she was in the garden i called her back in then she just looked at me and refused to move then ran out into the middle of the road and refused to move and would run down the road if i got close to her but as mentioned before she would listen perfectly if she was on a lead. Any suggestions on how to fix these problems apreciated ",

Training is either short spurts of 5-10 minutes more frequently or longer 20-25 minutes less frequently \nIf she gets it right she gets treats marked by good \nIf she gets it wrong either ignored or a firm no with a stern tone wich she understands is a negative reaction",

            "body": "I would say, instead of scolding your dog when the dog gets it wrong, figure out *why* the dog isn't listening.\n\nThere's 3 Ds in dog training, distraction, duration, and distance. Your dog is super new, you've only had her ten weeks. Novelty falls under one of the Ds, and your dog is too new to even have settled in fully. On top of that, how often do you call your dog back just to get a reward and go back out? \n\nSo, some steps:\n\n* Drop the \"firm no\" your dog is disobeying due to not understanding in the moment. Dogs don't generalize well and it's not going to train your dog what *to* do.\n\n* Use a long line instead of letting the dog off leash.\n\n* Call the dog back 20 times with a huge jackpot reward for every 1 time the dog would go back inside or leave fun.\n\n* Start conditioning your dog to a clicker, once conditioned, start using it the moment the dog starts listening to what you ask and follow up with high value rewards.\n\n* Lower distraction, don't give your dog a cue in distracting environments and watch the body language for signs of arousal - where your dog is hyped up. Don't cue where arousal is high.",
