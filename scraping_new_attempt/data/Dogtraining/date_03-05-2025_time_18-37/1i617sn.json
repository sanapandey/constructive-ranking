She\u2019ll drop it then come to me and whine. I\u2019ve tried teaching her to hold the ball first but she just thinks I\u2019m trying to play. It\u2019s weird I\u2019ve got the beginning and end down, but it gets lost in the in between. Any ideas? ",

Once the dog has the idea, ONLY reward when they bring to hand. It's up to you if dropping it at your feet is good enough, but if you're going on to performance activities, I'd make the dog give it TO YOU. \n\nOnly use the commands when training because you won't be able to reinforce them, and they will lose their power. Then you go from retrieve and return on 6ft leash, then longer leash, then off-leash in your fenced yard until the dog is solid.",

Then start slowly moving your hand further away, a few inches at a time. If she drops it on the floor instead of my hand, I would point at the toy and say \"try again\" and prompt her to pick it up. She caught on fairly quickly. I can now ask her to give me an item and she will put it in my outstretched hand.",

If you haven't shaped anything before I would recommend to start with something easier/new like picking up a pen or so. Just to get them to learn the concept of shaping.\n\nI've also had some success with changing the game by sitting down. This makes it different for the dog and possibly easier to train the wanted behavior because it's a (sort of) new thing. Using a specific toy can also help. Initially only use the specific toy when you're training the new behavior.\n\nYou could work with a clear large target (a large piece of cardboard or something) and shape towards releasing the ball on the target. Then you can make it smaller later.\n\nLast but not least: I don't know your intention, but if it is entertaining your dog and letting them have a good time, you can just go along with their behavior. If they find it fun to drop it elsewhere and fetch you and then maybe chase you for it, then that's just fine too (if you're fine with it). Whatever you both find acceptable and fun is good. You don't have to do it perfectly like it's supposed to by some non-existing standard.",
