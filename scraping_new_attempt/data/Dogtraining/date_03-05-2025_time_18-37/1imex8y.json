    "selftext": "So I think I messed up my dogs drive for playing fetch...\n\nI have a 5yr old Field Golden Retriever and her ball is her favorite thing in the world.   \n  \nI actually used to have the opposite problem than lack of drive. She would take off sprinting the second my arm would flinch before I had even thrown the ball (and then sometimes not realize I had thrown it in a different direction because she wouldn't wait to see me actually throw it).\n\nAnyway, I am an idiot and wanted to work on some impulse control/recall with her. So for a few days I would throw her the ball and halfway through her sprint I would call her back to me and then immediately release her to go get her ball. To her credit she would listen. \n\nHowever, now she doesnt run after her ball every time. But it seems random. Sometimes she will sprint after it 5 times in a row, and then randomly on the 6th time just take a couple steps and stop. \n\nI can get her to sprint after her ball if I get her really excited about it first, but I never used to have to do this. I have tried praising her more (and switched her ball too) and have obviously stopped recalling her mid-sprint, but I am still having this issue. \n\nDoes anyone have any pointers? I really appreciate any help! ",
