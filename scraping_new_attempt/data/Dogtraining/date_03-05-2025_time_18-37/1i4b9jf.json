    "selftext": "My 3 year old dog is potty pad trained. He poops and pees on the pad. My problem is when he pees on the pad sometimes he steps over the pee, but the majority of the time he\u2019ll step RIGHT in the pee puddle forcing me to be out there with him every time and wipe his foot off. It didn\u2019t used to be a problem, but we now have a 10 month old who will be walking and crawling soon. Is there any way to train him to not directly step in his pee??? ",
