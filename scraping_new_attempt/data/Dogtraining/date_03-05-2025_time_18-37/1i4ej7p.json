    "selftext": "I adopted a 4yo Bouvier des Flandres, and I know from the previous owner that he wasn't socialised super well since he got him during the pandemic, and the owner feel ill afterwards. \n\nI don't understand if it's an aggressive, territorial, herding or other type of behavior and therefore am not sure what approach is the best. He's been with us since June and is way less reactive now than he was before but I still can't seem to find what to do to make this behavior stop entirely.\n\nHere's the problem: when I have guests coming over, even when the dog seems to be fine with them for a while (here, fine means for example my guest is on the couch and my dog will actively come and lay on their lap and fall asleep on their lap, so it really looks like he's comfortable with them unless I'm mistaken?!), if the person stands up to go to the bathroom for example, when they come back, my dog will start barking at them again. \n\nHe does calm down pretty quickly (maybe 10-20 second) but it still is annoying and can be frightening for some guests since he's a tall 70lbs black dog. \n\n",

However, the barking behavior still happens after my dog seems to have been fine with the people around and I can't pinpoint if this is still territorial barking or not, and if so how to react to help this behavior stop.",
