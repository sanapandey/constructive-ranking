    "selftext": "I have a small (7kg) maltese x pomeranian who is 10 years old and a newborn baby who is 2 weeks old. \nMy dog is very territorial and not friendly with strangers, he has occasionally bit people who have tried to pat him that he does not know. He has always had these behaviours. \n\nWhile I was in hospital and recovering from childbirth, my mum kept my dog for 2 weeks. We also gave my mum the baby\u2019s blanket so he could be familiar with the smell. \n\nWe have only recently brought my dog home and I am feeling very anxious and nervous that my dog won\u2019t react well. So far, he has been peaking in and scratching the bassinet every time the baby cries, and sitting next to us when we are feeding the baby. He has been circling and walking around the bassinet when the baby cries too. Are these bad signs he is not adjusting well to the baby? \n\nI love my dog so much but I am really worried for my baby as my dog is not the friendliest when it comes to strangers. \n\nLooking for any advice at all to help! :( ",

It is not worth the risk for your dog or the baby to introduce them without a professional. They are more expensive, but the initial investment will be totally worth it when nobody gets hurt. Congratulations on the new baby!",

I have a little rescue that has a bite history (luckily he has seemed to stop biting). Whenever children come over - he is perfect. He loves little kids. I am just saying that because I think dogs can be different depending on the person. Hopefully your dog will come to see the baby as part of his pack and it will be fine.",
