    "selftext": "My 5 yr old female Lab is generally a sweet girl. She picked up territorial barking from my neighbour\u2019s dog when she was a puppy and I\u2019ve been trying to correct that over the years without much success. That, however, pales in comparison to how she goes absolutely mental when she\u2019s in the water. Like a lot of labs that I know, she\u2019s water-crazy. She\u2019ll literally tremble with what I assume to be excitement as we approach a lake. When she\u2019s in the water swimming, she barks non-stop. She\u2019s like a 5 yr old kid at the pool on the 1st day of summer yelling her head off. I know most dogs who enjoy water bark with glee and are playful when near water, but mine really does go overboard. Does anyone have any insight on why her excitement levels are so high and how I might manage it? ",

I have to search out lakes in my area where few people go to because I don\u2019t want to feel like a nuisance to others at the regular watering holes.",

Is she going to be barking while she is chasing a ball or frisbee?\n\nReally the only options are to direct her energy to something other than barking, or to reduce her excitement around water but that would be a much longer process (first practice calm at a distance from the water, then approaching, then toes in the water, etc. potentially over many training sessions).",
