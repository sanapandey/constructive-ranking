    "selftext": "Hey!\n\nSo we've had a maltipoo puppy for a couple weeks now, me and my family. His name is Kaladin and I love him more than anything in the world.\n\nI don't know if he's experiencing separation anxiety or what, but let me start with a little background.\n\nAlso this is my first time owning a dog as an adult, though I've had many pets in my life I was just too young to deal with the trainning.\n\nSo he came home, we were crate training. I tried letting him sleep IN the room with me in his crate the first night. He wouldn't settle. Any slight movement sent him howling and screaming.\n\nSo I put him in the living room and surprisingly it settled him down. He spent the next few nights in the crate, and then my family got a big playpen. So we folded it a few times, he has lots of room in there, and generally speaking he loves it. But this is where I'm getting a little confused, and am relying on my parents.\n\nHe's.... 10 weeks, almost 11. We started putting him into the pen at night instead once we got it. He sleeps in his bed, with his blankie. He sleeps the whole night and it's great! When my parents wake up in the morning (I've been working overnight this week) he doesn't even stir. Just relaxes in his bed until it's time to come out. He goes in on his own too and lays down, so when he does they close the door and let him relax.\n\nIf I'm around it's completely different though. He's very attached to me, probably because I'm the one who's spent the most time with him, and who plays with him the most. He's awesome, loves playing, is in the nipping phase but I'm trying to work onn it.\n\nAt night time, there's no issue when he goes in the pen. He doesn't even cry, honestly. Unless I linger a long time. But I put him in, give him a treat, say goodbye, grab my stuff and go upstairs. He sleeps all night.\n\nIf he is put in the pen in the middle of the day, and I am there though... forget it. He goes nuts. Screaming, screaming, screaming non-stop. I've been told and read everything from ignore him to give him treats. When I try to ignore him, my parents end up trying to give him a toy or talking to him so he goes more nuts...\n\nI've tried a clicker every time he's quiet, and a treat immediately after with the command \"quiet\". But I'm really scared I'm doing it wrong and don't want to reward or teach the wrong behavior.\n\nHappy to answer any iestions that may help\n\nPS. Can I ask a secondary question here or does this thread need to remain on this specifric topic?",
