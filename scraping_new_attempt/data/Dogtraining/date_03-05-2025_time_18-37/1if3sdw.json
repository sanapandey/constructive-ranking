    "selftext": "I live in a rural town and my older neighbor couple walk by with their two large dogs every day. I have a 1.5 year old who gets along great with their German shepherd. Never any issues. We usually chat for a bit while the dogs play. Then they rescued a runaway husky that clearly has some behavioral issues. I suspect he\u2019s just not had a ton of training and was somewhat neglected or they wouldn\u2019t have found him wandering on the road matted and caked with mange. I can tell he\u2019s a sweet boy but he barks a lot when they walk by so the husband just holds him back and doesn\u2019t let him greet anyone while the other two dogs get to play. The husband yells at him to shut up and if he pulls forward on the leash he\u2019ll sometimes hit him. They\u2019re older, so I suspect there\u2019s a gap in understanding for more modern positive reinforcement training methods but I desperately want to try and help them with this obviously troubled dog. Im not a professional so I don\u2019t really know what to even say except hitting the dog isn\u2019t helping anything. Do you say something to people who hit their dog? They truly care about the animals and I know they\u2019re not neglecting them per se, but they\u2019re both super large dogs and as far as I can tell they\u2019re barely walking them a quarter mile once or twice a day. I\u2019ve casually mentioned that huskies especially need to RUN and get lots of exercise as they are prone to running away and escaping. They are older so I assume they may not be able to run them as much as needed. I would offer to walk them once in a while but I can\u2019t get in the habit of that and I don\u2019t want to feel obligated on a regular basis. It\u2019s just tough to see the husky in particular suffer. Appreciate thoughts. ",

However, I did learn that most likely the husky has learned leash aggression from his owner yelling at and hitting him while other humans and dogs are around. They\u2019ve had the husky for about 6 months now and the owner has never tried to make progress with proper greeting techniques or changes of any kind. He just holds the dog back and genuinely seems surprised every time when the dog barks aggressively.",

Unfortunately, barring taking on walking responsibilities yourself which would obviously be a huge commitment for you, it's unlikely they'll start giving the dogs what they need. Your best bet might be to print out some materials on the exercise needs of huskies and how sufficient exercise helps lead to good behavior and then have a frank, but friendly, conversation with them. Maybe offer to walk them occasionally when you're taking your own dog out and it might shame your neighbor into being a better dog owner.",
