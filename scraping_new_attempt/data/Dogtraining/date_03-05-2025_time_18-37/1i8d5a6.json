    "selftext": "Hello fellow dog lovers, we have a 3 yr old fixed male German Shepard who has been with us since he was 6 weeks old\u2026 He is overall an excellent dog and companion for myself and my husband\u2026 Our biggest issue is his constant intense whining while we travel, he has always gone with us in car rides whether it was short distance or long distance so he is use to being in the car\u2026 However he constantly whines and whines and whines, which drives my husband insane while he is driving\u2026 Today for example we had to travel 2 hour from home for me to get some medical tests done and he whined the whole time, whether we slow down or come to a complete stop in intensive\u2019s drastically\u2026 We ensure he has access to water, we put his bed in the back for him to lay on and bring a couple of his favourite toys with us so he has some familiar items from home but nothing seems to help\u2026 Any advice would be greatly appreciated so much so our travelling experience doesn\u2019t turn into a frustrating nightmare \n",
