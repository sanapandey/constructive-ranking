    "selftext": "Hi, I have a question and hope to find some answer here. I have a 4 year old Mini Bull Terrier, yes that means she is a Covid puppy. She is well trained, but when she starts playing with other dogs, the first thing she goes for is their ears. Initially we thought I wouldn\u2019t be an issue but she doesn\u2019t like to let go, even sometimes if we try to call her off. I don\u2019t want to use a shock collar or anything like it but I\u2019m really lost at what to do. It\u2019s hard to take her anywhere to play with other dogs cause it mostly ends up in her holding onto another dog and not letting go.\n\nIf anyone has any advice on what to do that would be amazing!! Thank you!",

            "body": "I totally get how frustrating this must be, especially when you just want her to play nicely with other dogs. It sounds like she\u2019s just gotten really focused on the ears, maybe out of excitement or habit. What\u2019s important is catching her right when she starts going for the ears and calmly telling her \u201cleave it\u201d or something similar. You can redirect her with a toy or another form of play to break the habit. Keeping her on a leash when she\u2019s around other dogs can help you step in quicker if she gets fixated on the ears.\n\nIt also helps if she\u2019s getting enough physical and mental exercise, so maybe adding more playtime or puzzle toys could help burn off that extra energy. I totally agree with you on avoiding shock collars, they can create more problems. If it keeps up, a trainer could be super helpful in giving you more hands-on guidance. But with some patience and consistency, you\u2019ll get her back on track",

She gets a ton of exercise and is out almost all day.\n\nOne of her trainers mentioned it could be a lack of socialization due to her being a retired service dog. This problem only started after we retired her.\n\nI think the leash idea might work, thank you!!!",
