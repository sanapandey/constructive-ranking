    "selftext": "I have a 4 year old rescue doggo named Ziva.  We aren't sure of her breed but we think she is part ridgeback, part staffy, part who knows\n\nShe has usually been very social and good with other dogs and people.  These days she is quite anti social with other dogs, even dogs she knows.  She walks on the opposite side of me from the other dog and then waits until the dog is past her and then circles back to sniff the dog from behind.  \n\nHer appetite hasn't changed, we haven't used treats/rewards to help her with this yet, but I have read other posts on here and I see that might help.\n\n  \nShe has recently started going on walks with friends and their rottweiller, and they play pretty rough.  I think it's not a good situation for Ziva because it seems she is fighting for her life with these 'play times'.  We have stopped them hanging out for now because of this, but we are not sure how to fix this behaviour now.  I have always thought that hanging out with the bigger rougher dog began this situation and now we are looking to rectify it.\n\n  \nAm I on the right track here? Thanks in advance",

Am I on the right track here?\n\nYou and Ziva going on a structured, on leash walk with other friends and their dogs is fine. Clearly the play is not. Play should be mutual, and what you're describing is not mutual.  The worst thing could happen is for her to snap back at the Rottweiler and the Rottweiler not take it well. \n\nIn all situations you need to \"listen\" to what your dog is telling you, respect it,  and advocate for your dog.  I think Ziva has been very clear that she is not comfortable.  The notion that dogs need to socialize in this way is untrue. \n\nYou might want to have her checked out at your veterinarian to make sure there isn't a pain issue as well. Just to make sure you've checked all the boxes.",

            "body": "This is not anti-social behavior. It\u2019s great. Dogs walking on leash shouldn\u2019t interact with other strange dogs. They should smell where they mark and walk with their owners. Most people\u2019s idea of an ideal \u201csocial\u201d dog is actually \u201chyper social\u201d (loving and engaging with everybody and everything, going up to every single person) that\u2019s not the natural nature of most dogs. You see it in breeds that were heavily bred for personality like golden retrievers. But what being \u201csocial\u201d truly means in the dog world is operating within boundaries , manners and social structures that exist. Knowing if a dog is correcting, disrespecting, or communicating something to you and being able to appropriately respond with correct communication and behavior. Even a dog that growls at a dog it doesn\u2019t like wouldn\u2019t necessarily be called anti-social because that\u2019s communicating what it wants to communicate. Your dog may be not outwardly friendly to other dogs, I think that\u2019s fine and preferred. It is either because it\u2019s maturing, is fulfilled in the play and understands the difference between being introduced to a dog friend vs. seeing a stranger where it should have more of a reserved demeanor. Definitely watch the play, if it\u2019s too rough call it off.",

            "body": "Sounds like you hit the nail on the head with the rottie she has been playing with. Play should be equal and a dog with good doggy language will let the other dog \"win\" sometimes to encourage the other to keep going. The other dog isn't getting this. Play is only fun when the dog isn't being forced to do it, and can communicate they need a break or are overwhelmed, and their opponent will listen.\n\nShe may be nervous of other dogs because she just doesn't have the energy to do that, she doesn't think play is fun if she's only been playing with the rottie previously, who sounds like a bully to be honest.\n\nDon't let her around the rottie anymore unless the owner can train it to restrain itself. If you know anyone with dogs with excellent doggy language and empathy, try to hang with those as much as you can. She will learn that not all dogs are jerks and some dogs do care about her feelings and she will gain some confidence",

            "body": "This does not sound like anti-social behavior to me either at all. The human equivalent would be random people coming up to you wanting to tell you about their favorite book they just read. I would call myself a sociable person, but I would not always be ready and happy to chat with everyone and anyone about their favorite book when I'm in a rush somewhere, while I'm reading, when I'm on my way to the bathroom in the morning or maybe I don't feel safe around them. Not even necessarily everyone I know and am friends with, sometimes I just want to be in my own head. Think about how much humans vary in terms of how ready they are to start these kinds of conversations with anyone and everyone. Giving other dogs space in and of itself is actually great and polite from your dog.  \n  \nHowever, if you get the sense that your dog is fearful or apprehensive in these situations, you could think about what you should work towards is neutrality towards other dogs and making sure your dog knows that you're there to listen and help advocate for her if she can't. You can watch for body language. Ears and eyes should be relaxed, their body loose and \"wiggly\", tail relaxed. As they get stressed, they might start licking their lips, fixate and stare, ears might get tucked all the way back, their mouth closes and tenses up and/or their body and tail might stiffen (a big light-bulb moment for me was realizing the difference between a tense wag and a happy \"loose\" wag!), they might even raise their hackles on their back at the neck or butt (like goosebumps for humans), but that might be tricky for Ziva if she's inhereted that from the ridgeback side. In the extreme they might tuck their tail, pin their ears way back and lower themselves a bit on the ground or pant. Initially I didn't catch all this in time, but if they shake off afterwards, that's a dead giveaway that \\_something\\_ was making them stressed (they do this when they're overexcited too, it's their way of coming back into a calmer state). They also might start sniffing the ground (as a way of displacing their feelings) before or during the encounter, and pick up sticks or leaves. These are all ways of calming themselves and regulating their feelings (so it's really good that they do these behaviors, but the fact that they need to tells you that the encounter was stressful).\n\nWith training neutrality, you can do parallel (leashed) walks with another owner+dog pair, where the two dogs don't interact, they just learn to walk in parallel and sniff together (you can start this at a bigger distance and gradually get closer while still walking in parallel) or you can simply watch the world go by with some treats (maybe even bias Ziva with timing the treats as soon as she spots another dog). Just make sure that you start at a distnace where she still feels comfortable. I usually think of this as teaching your dog that \"seeing a dog does not equal having to actually encounter that dog\", because that (often false, in worse cases true) assumption is what often leads to reactivity. The more often you can expose Ziva to other dogs where nothing major happens (not just from your perspective but also from hers!), the better :) \n\nIt also might make sense to find \"safe\" friendly dogs you two can hang out with. Often, calmer adult dogs are great for this, they don't even need to play, just coexist. If they do play, what you want to look out for is the same loose body language from both of them, frequent pauses where they check in with each other, \"turn-taking\" (so they swap roles back and forth in terms of who chases who, even and especially if there's a big size difference) and respecting when the other says no (turns away/shakes it off or otherwise indicates that they don't want to play). That being said, each dog has their preferences and comfort zone in terms of play styles, all is good as long as everyone is happy and cool with it :) (My dog really loves low-contact medium-fast running where the other stops a lot, so she can \"run away\" but she's okay with \"pawsy\" dogs as long as they are slow about it.) Repeatedly trying to invite someone to play is of course ok, as long as the other dog doesn't get agitated and initiator doesn't ram into the other dog or make them more and more uncomfortable. At that point it's \\_vibes\\_. If you have a fearful dog, a well-chosen playmate can be really important. Some pairings are a natural fit, but being able to play with different dogs (of varying ages, sizes and temperaments) is a social skill, and some owners and have put more work into this than others. Trust your gut and especially Ziva here!\n\nAlso, I think Ziva's extremely lucky to have you as an owner, who cares enough to notice these things, think about it and find more ways to keep her happy!",
