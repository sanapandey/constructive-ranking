    "selftext": "My gf has had a dog since September. He is a year old.  We recently started dating and he seems very jealous when I am around.  He will jump on us or make noises. He will even seem to try to separate us.   In the past two days, even after taking him to the dog park and him and I playing together. When we came back to her place, she fed him and and while we sat to get ready to eat. He full on peed right in front of us.   And then another time we were having adult time for the first time in front of him and he did it again.     Any idea what\u2019s going on?",
