    "selftext": "Our dog (lab/beagle) will snap at a stranger\u2019s heel only when they are inside our house, sometimes making contact. We were told he did this when we adopted him and they weren\u2019t able to do anything to fix it. They are soft nips but still! We have tried having the stranger pet and treat him like crazy before walking in but he still, sometimes, does it. He will be perfectly calm, letting them pet him and licking their face and he will do it. It happens so fast we don\u2019t have time to \u201ccorrect\u201d him. He doesn\u2019t do this at other peoples houses or on walks. Hes been through obedience training and is fantastic in listening. He\u2019s basically a perfectly well behaved dog otherwise but we can\u2019t have him doing this. Anyone experience anything similar?",
