    "selftext": "I\u2019m getting close to the end. I have an 8 month old Bernese Mountain Dog that we got at 11 weeks. Her breeder had her near housebroken we kept up with it, she was doing well. A few accidents, but for a young puppy, to be expected.\n\nNow. She will not stop messing in the house. We\u2019ve tried everything we can think of outside of physical punishment and outdoor life. Leashed to us, crate training, strict supervision, strict routine, eliminate stress, block access to troublesome areas, vet appointments\u2026 Nothing. She\u2019ll get up, go, go about her day.\n\nShe\u2019ll get up, get a drink and pee on the floor seconds later. She\u2019ll eat and moments later, she\u2019ll poop. We\u2019ve tried feeding/watering her outside only, she\u2019ll just come in and do it. She will go outside, but still come in and finish. We\u2019ve tried outdoor runs, large fenced yard, sniff walks, leash in various spots. She just won\u2019t stop and will go in her crate as well.\n\nSuggestions welcome!",

It works best if you follow every instruction to a \u201cT\u201d, if your schedule permits. It\u2019s exhausting but better than the alternative in my opinion. (I was fortunate and was at home fulltime while house training. I don\u2019t know how to adapt this for those that are working outside their home.)",
