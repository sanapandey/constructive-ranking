    "selftext": "I adopted a puppy (estimate 6 months) that was starved and thrown in a dumpster. We don't know her past before that and are slowly figuring out her triggers. A big one we are noticing is that she barks and cowers when new people acknowledge her. She does not bark at people if they pass on a walk and ignore her, talking to her seems to be the biggest trigger. We aren't sure the best way to go about working with her to make meeting people less stressful. We live in a major city and will be interacting with people often and want her to be comfortable coming out with us.\n\nWould love any suggestions on incorporating exposure without furthering her trigger to the point she is barking at everyone.",
