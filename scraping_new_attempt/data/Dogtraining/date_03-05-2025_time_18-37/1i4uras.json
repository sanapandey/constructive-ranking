    "selftext": "My dog is a 16 month old jack russell, generally a very loving playful dog but sometimes when it comes to food not so much. \n\n\nI moved in with my partner when she was around 6 months old (my dog) and my partner has 14 month old toy caboodle. They each eat at the same time with bowls on the ground no problem. Sometimes swap mid way through meals.\n\nNow sometimes if I give them something from hand like something off my plate or even when we are just eating our own food. Sometimes treats. She gets very defensive and will go to pretty much attack my partners dog. \n\nLooking for an effective way to train this behaviour out of her? ",
