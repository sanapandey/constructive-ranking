    "selftext": "This is not about introducing the cat to the dog and vice versa, this is about how to train a dog to stop treating a car like a play toy, and to stop constantly chasing for the cat food. \n\nHi, i live in a household with a cat and dog. The dog is 3 years old and the cat is 6 months. These animals were introduced properly and initially there was no issue. They lives peacefully. \n\nRecently, the dog has been super hyperactive and reactive towards the cat. Constantly wanting to play with it whenever she hears the cats collar jingle. She constantly pushes the cat out the way when im trying to play with it to steal the attention from the cat. She also has a habit of playing too rough with the cat causing the cat to be in distress and hissing, stratching away the dog. No matter how many times we tell the dog to stop, rewards food behavior, or crate the dog, she does it again. The dog will also bark loudly when it cant reach the cat (when the cat goes into its hiding spot). \n\nAlso, the dog is very reactive to the cats food. When feeding the cat the dog cries when the food is put in a place it cant be reached but the cat can. The dog also go into my room at night and morning to try to steal the cats food when she has been told many times not to. \n\nI don\u2019t own the dog, it is owned by the other person i live with. The cat is mine but i am getting extremely fed up with the dog constantly attacking the cat and stealing its food, and the person who owns the dog isn\u2019t taking the measures to train the dog to stop, so i need advice because i may have to train the dog on my own to stop attacking/stealing from my cat. Its giving me a lot of stress and i dont have the background knowledge on dog training. Any advice would be appreciated. ",
