    "selftext": "My husband and I recently adopted a 6ish year old female bull terrier. We\u2019re not sure her history but it seems she came from a pretty bad situation. She gets along great with our 2 year old staffy terrier german shepherd mix and plays well with him. She is also very gentle and loving to our two cats. \n\nThe issue is she is very aggressive with small dogs. When on walks, if there are small dogs, especially small barking dogs she goes ballistic. It\u2019s like she\u2019s a whole different dog. Our neighbors small dog got into our yard and unfortunately she killed him. We have sorted that all out with the neighbor and they are not holding us at fault at all. They admitted he was an escape artist and they should have kept a better eye on him. \n\nWe have an appointment to get her fixed. I\u2019m hoping that may help and I\u2019m looking for an in person trainer. Any other advice, suggestions, or resources are greatly appreciated. ",
