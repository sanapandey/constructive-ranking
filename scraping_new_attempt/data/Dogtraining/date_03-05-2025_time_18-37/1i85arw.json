    "selftext": "If you know this breed type combo, they have a reputation for some annoying barks. Deep, so they carry far, and they have a keen eye, so basically I've seen her bark at falling leaves, lol. \n\nI got a bark collar and I make sure it's on when the sun goes down and before the sunrise. Basically, I let her bark during the day. \n\nI'm a stay at home wife, so she just hits the back door and I let her out throughout the day. She *loves* the cold of the winter and prefers to stay outside. \n\nI'm a heavy reader, so if I can't concentrate, I know my neighbors can't, either. If she keeps barking, I let her in. \n\nAnyways, animal control was called. Our city ordinance is more than 15 minutes of barking is considered a nuisance. I don't think she barks more than 15 minutes straight, but maybe I'm desensitized?? \n\nAny tips on how I should proceed? \n\n(Pls be kind) ",

She is just one of those Pyrs that likes to bark a lot. You can tell she gets a lot of enjoyment out of it. \n\nI wrote letters to my neighbors. Most called me and said my dog wasn't a bother. \n\nI'm actually not too concerned with the grumpy neighbor. Turns out, she calls animal control on all her neighbors with dogs.",
