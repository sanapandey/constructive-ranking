    "selftext": "My dog leans his body against me. That curve after his rib cage going towards the tail is where he\u2019ll position himself to put my knee/leg. He won\u2019t beg for pets or anything like that. He\u2019ll just stand there. Eventually he\u2019ll go into the sphinx position right in front of me",
