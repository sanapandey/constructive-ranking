    "selftext": "Hello! I am 12 weeks pregnant with our first baby! We are very excited! \n\nI also have two dogs, an almost 5 yo black lab, and an almost 4yo mini Aussie shepherd mix that we have had their entire lives. They\u2019ve not been around too many children, but when they are my lab tends to mostly ignore them and let them pet him. My mini Aussie mix is a little on the reactive side, but we\u2019ve worked with her and have learned how to respect her boundaries. She can be a little snappy at times though, so when kids are around we normally keep her away in a separate part of the house. \n\nI\u2019m not terribly worried about my lab, besides him being about 100 lbs and not realizing his size sometimes. But my Aussie mix worries me some, she\u2019s about 45 lbs if that\u2019s relevant, and extremely vigilant. She has gotten better as she\u2019s gotten older, or maybe I\u2019ve gotten better at realizing her triggers. \n\nWe plan to install baby gates and utilize play pens to keep the baby safe during tummy time, etc. \n\nWhat can I do to prepare them for their new baby brother or sister? Today I played baby sounds on YouTube for them. Their heads snapped up and they came running to the source of the sound. My lab seemed curious, wagged his tail, then continued on with his business. My Aussie mix came running and trembled a little, then calmed down after a couple minutes, a little slower than my lab, and continued on with her business. I plan to keep this up to get them used to the sounds. I also think my husband and I will put the baby items out as they arrive so they get used to seeing that stuff around the house. We will bring a blanket home from the hospital that\u2019s the baby was wrapped up in to let them sniff before we come home with the baby too so they know the scent. \n\nAnyone else been through this and have more suggestions for us? \n\nAlso noteworthy, my mini Aussie mix is muzzle trained. It seems to calm her down and she likes wearing it. \n\nHoping to look out for my first babies as we embark on this new chapter of our lives! \n\nThanks all! ",
