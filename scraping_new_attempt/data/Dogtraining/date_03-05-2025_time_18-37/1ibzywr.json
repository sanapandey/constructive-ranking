But since the move, her separation anxiety has gotten a lot worse (she no longer has any other company when I leave). I\u2019m taking very tiny baby steps to get her to get used to it again, but I\u2019ve read about certain anxiety meds I could use while training her (will eventually slow down on the meds once she\u2019s used to it). Does anyone have any experience/advice for me when it comes to medication?",

                    "body": "2 things are vital to desensitizing separation anxiety (or any kind of anxiety, really):\n\n1. Work below his settled threshold. In this state, your dog should willing to sit or lie down and look completely relaxed. If he gets up, it will be with purpose - to get a drink of water, or to look at something outside, etc. Sometimes standing still for a bit is ok too, but if he doesn't settle pretty quickly, you should assume he is on edge. He will not be pacing, whining, drooling, or exhibiting any other more energetic panic behaviors. Many people mistakenly feel that if he's not outright barking he's ok; he's not and if you approach it this way, you'll either stop progressing or see wild swings in success time, completely blurring any assessment of threshold.\n2. Suspend all absences save for the ones you do specific for training a handful of times a day. This is the hard part because you will need a social and/or professional support network of dog sitters, from short-term sitters to dog walkers to boarders, and as much redundancy as you can come up with in between. This is because anytime you need to go out without your dog (grocery shopping, dinner with friends, work, etc.), you absolutely must leave him with someone to avoid putting him into his panic, and you'll need backups for the backups for the backups, etc., to maximize the chances of someone being available in case you need to go out last minute and cannot put it off. Otherwise, if left to panic even once, the dog may regress, not only setting back your hard-earned training but also risk creating an aversion to further desensitization work.\n\nFinally, some dogs are so bad that they can't even stay relaxed if you walk out of the room, or in some cases, if you merely get up. If this is your dog, he may just be perpetually on edge worried about whether you're going to leave him, and may only be able to relax when you're physically unable to leave, i.e. sitting or lying down, or certainly not approaching any kind of exit threshold (in your dog's view). For this small, unfortunate percentage of dogs, the conventional pre-departure counter-conditioning exercises alone (where you grab your keys, purse, coat, and/or put shoes on, etc., and then don't leave) are unlikely to have a meaningful effect, as your dog is already on edge just by you simply walking around in and out of the room. In this case, you need to engage a veterinary behaviorist for help with your dog, as you will likely need to supplement your desensitization training with meds to help your dog relax. Some dogs may just need the meds to help them relax and focus on the desensitization; others may regress as soon as the meds are reduced and may need to take the meds for life. That's something the behaviorist will help you figure out. Otherwise, you'll find that you're never truly getting below that settled threshold mentioned in point #1 above, and any desensitization you do may struggle to get past the order of a few minutes if even that, depending, for example, on how tired your dog might be when doing the exercise.",

We captured a video of her being home alone for 10 minutes. She whined and barked, ran around the house looking for people, and ignored all the mental stimulation toys full of treats (puzzles, kongs, and snuffle mats). Her dog trainer referred me out to a dog behaviorist but her pet insurance won't cover it so I'm going try DIYing first. \n\nDoes anxiety meds really help? Should I attempt crate training? We have baby gates, should we confine her to the living room when we leave?",

            "body": "I brought home a 3 year old rescue miniature schnauzer 2 weeks ago. He's an incredibly sweet and calm little guy so long as I'm in eye sight. However, if I even go to the bathroom with the door closed he breaks into a panic. We had our first vet visit this past Saturday, and he was prescribed both Trazadone and Fluoxetine (though I am currently still waiting on the Prozac to be delivered from Chewy). I felt awful about having to immediately bring in medication, however I was unable to establish any form of baseline to reinforce off of since he would panic as soon as the door was closed.\n\nThe frustrating part of all of this, is that the rescue that I worked with didn't bring up that he had pretty bad separation anxiety when I was in the interview stage, or when I visited him either of the times with his fosters. I stated that I have to go into the office twice per week for 6 hours and felt bad by the notion of having to crate a dog for the duration of that. I was assured by his fosters that he was a very mellow and even tempered, and that he didn't seem to display any separation anxiety since they had brought him in. When I did have to go in last Thursday, I restricted him to only the living room with two different gates. When I was out he knocked down the gate to get to the door and chewed the baseboard underneath of it out of anxiousness. Naturally, we started immediately started properly crate training following this.\n\nNow I feel bad and a bit trapped. He isn't my first mini and I personally love their quirks and personalities. However, I've never had one with this level of anxiety before, let alone an adult one. I love him already, but I just want to be able to close the door to my bedroom without a full blown panic. I'm going to start reaching out to behaviorists tomorrow, because I'm nervous that he's more than what I can personally handle.",

                    "body": "Two weeks isn\u2019t very long, so I\u2019d definitely recommend that you wait and see what changes as he settles in. It\u2019ll take 2-3 months for him to feel comfortable.\n\nI adopted a puppy at 8 weeks that had similar \u2018symptoms\u2019 to what you describe. He\u2019s 4 now, and the struggle with his ongoing separation anxiety has impacted almost every area of my life. Successful training requires a 100% elimination of absences, meaning that your dog cannot be alone and beyond his threshold for any amount of time. This includes you being in the shower, or running to get the mail, or leaving him in a car. I am married, and so it\u2019s almost always possible to have someone with him. If I were a single person, I would absolutely not have kept him.\n\nSeparation anxiety is hard to treat because it requires absolute consistency over a very long period of time (6-12 months depending on the dog). It is completely reasonable to not take it on as a single person, if you don\u2019t see improvement in his behavior as he settles in with you. I know it would be a terrible decision to have to make, but you don\u2019t have to feel bad in choosing to not fight a fight you can\u2019t win.\n\nLast thing, crate training is not recommended for dogs with separation anxiety. No modern methods suggest it, and it actively works against progress.",

It's been two months and we've made huge progress through Prozac/Trazodone and training. She actually does better when I'm gone for work and she's in her crate than when I'm in the house but have erred in my estimation of how long she's comfortable alone and now she's whining while I'm in the shower. I relate big time to the trapped feeling! I just wanted to say that I do think lower intensity separation anxiety can be improved without the ideal never-leave-them-alone advice being possible.",

She had been there since November and she was abandoned by her last owners who were alcoholics ( so probably not a good household). We\u2019ve had her since Saturday (so it\u2019s been 3 days) and we went out with a dog behaviorist who told us she\u2019s already really attached to us and we need to fix it before it becomes a big problem. So for context, the first night she slept outside in the living room and we slept in our bedroom with the door closed, everything was fine. Then the second night she slept with us on our bed  (we still were thinking if we should let her or not on bed so that night we let her) then after the walk with the behaviorist she recommended that our bedroom is off limits so she learns to be alone and not depend so much on us so we closed the door and she slept outside again. However, she would come every hour and a half crying and barking to let her in, which we didn\u2019t. And in the morning when we got out, we saw that she peed twice inside the apartment, something she hadn\u2019t done before so she was definitely stressed about sleeping alone. Now we\u2019re trying to make sure to keep her off the bedroom and try to avoid behaviors that will reinforce her being dependent on us. But I would like some tips on how to achieve this, especially with the fact that she wants to be around us all the time even when were home and if we\u2019re not, she barks and cries.",

            "body": "Hi!\n\nFor context, we rescued our 2-year-old golden retriever, Cooper, about five months ago. He was found as a stray, so we don\u2019t know anything about his past. He\u2019s the sweetest dog I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nNow for his separation anxiety. He\u2019s very attached to me\u2014I often have to guide him back to his mat because he always wants to be near me. Since I work from home, that probably doesn\u2019t help. When we have to leave, he paces between the front and dining areas, barking constantly. Thankfully, he\u2019s not destructive, but he clearly gets stressed. Because of this, my wife and I rarely go out together.\n\nThings we\u2019ve tried:\n\n- Crate training \u2013 Made him much more anxious, likely due to his past as a stray. Since he\u2019s not destructive, we\u2019re fine giving him freedom.\n\n- Long-lasting treats \u2013 We\u2019ve used frozen Kongs, collagen sticks, and lick mats before/while leaving.\n\n- Desensitizing him to key sounds \u2013 I started wearing my keys at home, which helped reduce his alertness to them.\n\n- Short practice absences \u2013 Frequently leaving and returning after short periods.\n\n- Medication (Trazodone & Gabapentin) \u2013 No noticeable improvement.\n\n- Exercise before leaving \u2013 Taking him to the dog park beforehand helps sometimes, but it\u2019s not always practical.\n\nOddly enough, he\u2019s totally fine sleeping alone at night when we block off the upstairs with a gate.\n\nWe\u2019re not seeing much improvement yet, so I\u2019d love to hear what has worked for others!
