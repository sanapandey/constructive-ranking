    "selftext": "We are moving our 8 year old mixed Australian Border Collie overseas from a house with a backyard to a unit with no green space. He is a little anxious and has bad recall so he needs to be on a leash whenever we\u2019re outside. He has never pooped on a walk, ever. He just won\u2019t go. We\u2019ll now need to take him regularly to our local park to do his business, instead of him going outside in the backyard whenever he needed. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any experience with this and pointers to help with his training to adjust to the new environment and routine?",
