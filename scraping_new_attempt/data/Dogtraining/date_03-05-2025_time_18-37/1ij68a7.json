    "selftext": "Long story short, after some extenuating circumstance I ended up with 2 dogs. A two year old, and a 6 month old puppy. I already have two cats, and would have never gotten dogs if it wasn\u2019t life or death for them. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading what I can on introducing the two pairs (2 cats, 2 dogs) and it\u2019s all been so helpful! We are on week 2 and my cats seem more comfortable. The dogs are extra anxious, and I am sure it\u2019s mostly related to being abandoned. However, I have gotten conflicting opinions on how the older dog is behaving, and some have said he is ready to eat my cats immediately!! He gets so excited he is shaking. Most of the time he lays down, but once in a while he will growl and almost lunges and barks. What is your opinion about his behavior and body language? ",

                    "body": "From what I\u2019ve read, he is alert to them. Him laying down is showing he is trying to be calm, but then he gets overwhelmed and wants at them. I am still not sure if he wants to be aggressive with them? Or just smell them? He is really good with the puppy, he is generally calm. But he is absolutely obsessed with the cats. I also learned to give positive distractions instead of my natural reaction to say \u201cno\u201d\u2026 I guess I\u2019m looking for other insight on what body language he is presenting, as this is my first experience!",
