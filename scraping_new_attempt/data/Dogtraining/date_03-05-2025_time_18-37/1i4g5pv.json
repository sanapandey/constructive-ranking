    "selftext": "My dog is whining every day, mostly before a walk, before eating, even when I lock eyes with her or she wants me to pet her. She also shivers a lot. I have two other dogs so I mostly go on walks with all of them, but when I occasionally take just her she whines and barks which seems to be more from excitement but I feel like she's also pretty dependent on my other dogs as she grew up with them. A vet recommended giving her pills for anxiety but they don't seem to be working. She's a very smart spaniel mix, she knows a lot of stuff and learns quickly, she actually loves to learn, but when it comes to her whining/barking it seems like she doesn't listen. I have ADHD and anxiety so it can be really overwhelming, especially when she does it outside. I feel really helpless at this point, maybe I lack technique or discipline but it genuinely feels like nothing works, I would appreciate it if anyone has some tips on what to do:(",
