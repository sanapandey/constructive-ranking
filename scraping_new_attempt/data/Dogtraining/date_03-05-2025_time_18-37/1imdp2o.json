    "selftext": "Hi! My pup is turning one, and he is right in his adolescence. I need some advice!\n\nMy dog learns fast and listens pretty well. However, when I bring him to places, he becomes hard to manage as he gets wayyy too excited, not following or listening to us. We make sure to take a walk and play with him before we head out, but it doesn't seem to help. He's gotten more reactive for a lil while, so maybe it's a phase, but I'd rather work on it with him. \n\nToday, I brought him to the pet store. He was SO excited to go. In the car, screaming/whining (he does that when he's very happy), outside the car he was still screaming and tugging at the leash. I didn't let him go to the pet store right away, as I was trying to calm him down first by asking him to sit down. He could hardly sit still for more than 2 seconds, and he would continuously scream and whine. I understand he's super excited, but I can't imagine what the other people around think is going on when they hear his banshee screams, lol.\n\nAsking for some advice I can try it before contacting my dog trainer! Thanks!",

He is great at them!But he lacks that outside the home and with specific triggers\n\n He is also tired out with exercise before we go out with him to try to minimize his excitement, to no avail\n\nMy dog is perfectly healthy and gets checked periodically.",

I think his behaviour got worse ever since winter began, maybe because we never have \"sit down and do nothing at the park\" anymore. When spring rolls around and it gets warmer, I'll go make him do long boring activities, eheh.",

One, to save me from embarrassment, but also to teach him that just because we go there doesn't mean you going to see your best friends. It really makes it easier to take your time and work on relaxation protocols if there isn't anyone else around.",

I used fish skins exclusively for recall because it was important to me snd my dog is a beagle mix so she struggled with it. Rewarding for calm in small steps like the other comment suggested and also remembering in new environments, you\u2019re gonna have to step back to level zero because they\u2019re going to be exciting all over again. Practicing when it\u2019s closed is great. I would even suggest not bringing them into the store until they were able to be calm in the parking lot. Just work on it in the parking lot then bring them home and try again until you\u2019re able to get them into the store. Maybe you\u2019ll only be able to get 10 feet into the store then bring them home but they\u2019ll get better every time",

Just a small one - even with my large breed dog we can do the figure 8 pattern in a space smaller than an empty car park. I also use this to move further away from the exciting place, and gradually return if calmness remains.",
