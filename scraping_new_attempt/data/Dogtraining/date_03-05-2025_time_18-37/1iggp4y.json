    "selftext": "Was out of town for the weekend and my young unaltered male (17 months) stayed home while my 5 year old spayed female and I went to a competition. Since we\u2019ve been home, my male has tried to hump her twice. Is this going to be a normal thing now? Is there anything besides redirection I can do? Maybe just stress/over excitement? He will stay unaltered until at least 2. ",
