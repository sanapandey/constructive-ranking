    "selftext": "Hello, I am looking for help with a problem I am having with my dog. My dog (a 3yo 85 pound Australian Cattle Dog mix) is the friendliest and most playful dog 95% of the time. He gets along great with other people, other dogs, and the vet, groomer, and daycare all love him very much.  \n\n  \nMy issue is that whenever people come over to my house he goes full on guard-dog mode. He barks his head off, shows teeth, raises his hackles, and will even nip at people if he manages to get close (he has not hurt anyone but he has bitten my cousins foot while his shoe was on and has torn another friend jacket). I have developed what I think is a good system for introductions:  \n\n1. Put up a gate between the entrance area and the rest of the house so he stays back.\n2. Gently but sternly tell him \"no\" while he continues to bark and wait for him to calm down.\n3. Once the barking has stopped for a few moments I tell him \"good boy\" and give him a treat (I think I am rewarding him stopping the behavior but worried I may accidentally be rewarding the behavior?). Then if he continues behaving well I give the guest some treats to give him.\n4. If he does not continue barking and his hackles stay down (or he does the stress-relief shake) I will open the gate (with the guests permission) and monitor closely as he gets his smells in and is okay with the guest.\n\nOnce this process is done, he loses any sense of hostility and wants to be best friends with the guest. He will wag his tail, go find his nearest toy, and do anything and everything that shows he is friendly and wants nothing more than to play. The hostility never comes back and this is the only situation that I have ever seen that side of him come out. It is maybe worth noting that he does this even to people he has met many times.\n\n  \nEven if this is a good method, there are a few reasons I want to try to alleviate the hostility all together.  \n\n* Right now I live alone, but it looks like my cousin (the one whose foot he bit) is going to move in. He obviously doesn't want to have to do that process every time he comes home and he is worried (rightfully so) about what might happen if he comes home when I am not home. Also worth noting that when I first got my dog as a puppy I already had a roommate and there was never any issue there up until the roommate moved out (when the dog was roughly 1yo).\n* I recently moved so I have space to actually host friends. In my old house I could have 2-3 people over max so it wasn't a big hassle to do this process but now that I can have more over it would get tiring to have to monitor the door and do all of this every single time.\n* It is also uncomfortable for everyone involved. A lot of guests are very understanding but some get understandably freaked out and are wary of him after. I am a big guy and have no issue controlling him, but he is still 85 pounds and has quite the bark on him which is intimidating for many. It also makes it stressful for me to have people over and of course, I obviously don't want my dog to be so stressed out every time someone comes over.  \n\nSo really I am looking for any help to both get him comfortable with my cousin before he moves in (in roughly a month or two) and to be generally more comfortable with people when they first get through the door.",

It is not like people trigger him all the time, it is only when people are coming over, so it is hard to remove the antecedent/trigger as it is just something that is bound to happen. I also don't understand because he is not getting the sought after reward (I assume hostility is to keep people away) as the guest does not leave, but also the behavior does not persist at all after the introduction phase. Maybe I am not fully grasping how to apply these techniques and could use some guidance on that.",

            "body": "Its always beat to have your dog meet strangers or people he doesn't see very often on neutral territory. So meet down the street, and go on a 5-10 minute walk with your guest. If he is uncomfortable at first, let the person walk in front a little bit. Your guest can drop a couple of treats. After 5 mins, if your dog is calm and not scared or anxious, have your guest reach their hand out a little with a treat (not in your dogs face). Teaching place and stay will also help a lot inside. Teaching place, is telling your dog to go to his bed or whatever his place is, and to stay there until he has calmed down. \n\nPlace: lure your dog onto a bed, folded blanket or small platform. Once all 4 paws are on it, mark it with \"good!\" And give him a treat. Do this a few times. On the 4th time, say \"Place\" once he has all 4 paws on the bed. Spend 5-8 miniutes doing this. You'll need to stay close to the bed the first few times you work on this. Most dogs will learn after one or two times and will go to the place, without you using your hand or treat to guside them on it. But it will take 3-5 times before you can be several feet away from the bed. \n\nStay: it's all about baby steps. Repeat everything 5-10 times. Have your dog sit and say stay. Take a step or two in front of your. Wait only a few seconds, go back and give your dog a treat. Do this 5-10 times. Then add a few more seconds in between each time. Dont show your dog a treat when you say stay or as you walk back bc that can cause him to get up. Gradually increase only one, distance or duration.  Repeat each one 5+ times. Once he understands, you can start adding distractions.",

Here in Aus it\u2019s very well known that heelers don\u2019t need a reason to dislike strangers, particularly in their home, it\u2019s a feature not a bug. They\u2019re used as guard dogs more often than they\u2019re used to move cattle! \n\nMaybe you can train it out of him, maybe you need to make peace with putting him up out of the way (yard, closed room etc) when company comes over. My dog is a ridgeback and is also currently a teenage territorial nutcase. If I\u2019m expecting company I have him on a leash outside the house, when my guest arrives we have a chat and they\u2019re told to ignore him completely no matter if he barks or not, and once he ignores them too we all go into the house together. \n\nI\u2019ll likely have to do this even after he matures and grows a brain because I specifically sought out a breed that\u2019s suspicious of strangers. You might too. American (if that\u2019s where you are) ACDs do tend to be softer than Australian lines, but they\u2019re still heelers.",

I\u2019m reaching out to a family friend who is a dog trainer to see what she has to say. Right now I think my next plan of attack is to teach him the \u201cplace\u201d command to get him to go to his bed and wait whenever people are coming in. As for my cousin, I think I am going to try desensitizing my dog to him by having him come over frequently and even doing some commands with him.  \n\nMy mom also came over the other day and he didn\u2019t react so that gives me hope that there is a way. He definitely doesn\u2019t see her more frequently than others. She walked in with me through the garage and he didn\u2019t see us until we were well within the house so maybe just being far away from point of entry helps.",

I also stand by my dog and let him bark at the visitor for a little bit and then tell him to place and thank him for his barks. The way our house is laid out, he owns the living room and guests stay in the kitchen. He can watch them from the living room.  I known visitor takes around 5 minutes to allow into his space and new visitors probably take 3 or 4 2 hour visits within a couple weeks to be OK. \n\nAt some point, you have to think about the natural tendencies of the genetics and how much you can practically change.\n\nSide note... My dog \"handled\" his first ever real intruders this weekend. Some folks were drunk and walked into our house through the unlocked door and were thinking to make themselves at home (they were at the right house number on the wrong street). Everything was dark and he kept them cornered barking very loudly. It was interesting to hear him up shift from an alert bark to a FAFO bark - that's when I knew it wasn't just the kids coming home late. It all went more or less to plan, of course, it probably would have been really bad news for them if they would have decided to try and stumble into the living room.\n\nDownside of this is what happens if you are having a personal emergency and paramedics need to come in and help you. In my case this is unlikely but if I feel like I'm having a heart attack or something, I'm going to have to go wait for them in the front yard, lol!",
