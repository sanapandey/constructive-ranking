    "selftext": "Hi we brought home a very terrified young adult dog about 5 weeks ago. She is sweet and gentle. Our two resident cats have recently (in the last couple days) started chasing her. We had another dog that passed away about a year and a half ago, and the cats were more afraid of that dog. But now we have a role reversal. The dog isn\u2019t exactly playful with them so not sure if the cats are playing or intimidating her. At other times of the day, they are happy to sit on my lap next to the dog,  and go to sleep close to her. Any suggestions?",
