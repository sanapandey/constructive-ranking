    "selftext": "Hey everyone. I have a golden doodle that\u2019s a little of a year old and he really hasn\u2019t grown out of the chewing stage. He\u2019s constantly chewing my watch, the couch, the bed, everything. I give him chew bones and Kongs. He also does get long walks. It seems like no matter what he is chewing. I did go to a trainer for a while but she was brand new and I actually got nothing out of the training, which is really tragic. I have been trying to teach him \u201cleave it\u201d but he isn\u2019t absorbing the command. I\u2019ve tried the bitter spray and he completely by passes that. Whenever I try to stop him from chewing anything, he thinks he\u2019s a game. Should I go back to a trainer for this? Does anyone have any good advice for this? Thank you!! ",

Also teach him to \u201cleave it\u201d - or a command it says but it didn\u2019t work. I didn\u2019t recognize the YouTube video links that were there so I have not done those.",
