    "selftext": "Hello everyone, apologies in advance for weird mobile formatting,\n\n    I have a roughly two year old foxhound that was an abandoned hunting dog. When he was found last year we took him to the vet immediately after notifying the local shelter and lost animal pages and he got a full checkup with vaccinations and we took him home. Since then we have worked so hard on obedience, house training and kennel training and it\u2019s been going really well\u2026..until about a month ago. He previously went into the kennel with absolutely no problems and slept through the night almost every night with no fuss. Now, he hates his kennel, cries almost the entire time he\u2019s in it and wakes me up at least one a night to go outside. Now, I don\u2019t mind waking up to go potty, I also have to pee in the middle of the night sometimes so I don\u2019t expect that from him all the time. It\u2019s the sudden problems just being in the kennel, nothing has happened and he is rarely in his kennel for more than 6-8 hours at bedtime. My husband is home most of the time so he\u2019s rarely kenneled in the day time. I have tried feeding him in his kennel again to help with positive associations, doing fun snuffle games in the kennel, a special blanket. I just don\u2019t know what else to do.  I\u2019d leave him out but he was recently diagnosed with heart worms (he\u2019s been on a religious preventative since we got him but was likely infected with larvae when he was initially tested) and he\u2019s close to finishing his 30 days of doxycycline and he\u2019s had more accidents since starting it. I appreciate any and all advice, I just want him to be comfy again. ",

I was concerned that he may be in pain from antibiotics or the month long doxycycline was damaging his liver and all tests are clear and the vet doesn\u2019t seem to think he\u2019s in pain but may just not be feeling well. I just want to make him more comfortable again.",
