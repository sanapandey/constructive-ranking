    "selftext": "My 1 year old Podengo Pequeno has what we call \"baby tantrums.\" She'll get really tired, but instead of just going to sleep like a normal ~~person~~  dog, she just goes insane and wants to be a menace to society (it's me. I'm society). I give her toys, she gets walks, treats, we do all the things to get her energy out. I've read this is specifically a puppy thing and they eventually grow out of it, but what can I do in the mean time? She'll literally flail about, stop, have her eyes droop and be about to fall asleep, then wake up and go nuts again. She fights for her life to stay awake and I don't understand. Thank you! ",
