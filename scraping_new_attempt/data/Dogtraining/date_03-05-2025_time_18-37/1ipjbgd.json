    "selftext": "So my 14 month old pup has been crate trained from the start. He does fantastic in his crate\u2026at my house. He sleeps in it in a separate room at night. \n\nLately we are starting to travel more. We like to go visit my family a couple hours away. He also has a crate there. But when I put him in it at night he freaks out, barking and crying and violently shaking the crate, I\u2019m pretty sure because he is in a strange place. Either way it\u2019s incredibly disturbing and I\u2019m afraid he will injure himself. \n\nI\u2019ll usually give it a little while, let him out and see if he needs to go potty, then right back into the crate\u2026then the barking and violently shaking the crate starts all over again. Finally about 3am I let him out and into my bed so we both could get some sleep. (Spoiler: we didn\u2019t get any sleep; he thought it was playtime). \n\nWhen we get back home, it usually takes a week or so to get him to sleep soundly in the crate again. He\u2019ll bark for about half an hour, then a little less with each night. It\u2019s a regression each time we stay overnight somewhere other than my house and I am getting discouraged. \n\nNow this weekend we have somewhere else we have to go, another place that he is unfamiliar with. We will be doing this often from now on due to my work. \n\nShould I give up on the crate altogether? I really need advice on this from folks more experienced than I am. \n",
