    "selftext": "Hi all!\nWhat are some everyday commands/ tricks your dog know that make your life easier? Simple obedience, like a good recall, is obviously important, but what simple, unique things have you taught your dogs that make walks and everyday life just a little bit smoother? My dogs know \"wait\", \"left/ right\", \"left/ right side (of me), \"move\" etc. I would love more suggestions like these!",

I also use this in the flat to stop her from following me, but not always successful \ud83d\ude02\n\nBack up = when she\u2019s right behind me and I have to open a door (mainly the front door), she needs to back up/walk away from me so I can do what I have to do\n\nOther than that, just the usual - sit, down, paw and high five on both sides, etc.",

Used initially for playing hide and seek at home (great game for rainy days) but then expanded to tell her to continue searching when she failed to find a thrown ball out in the park and looked back at me to check whether it really existed. Saves me from having to walk over and get it myself!",
