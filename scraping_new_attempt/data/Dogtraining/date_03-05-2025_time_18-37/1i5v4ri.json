    "selftext": "My 15 week old puppy has suddenly started barking growling and lunging at people when on walks. This began at the vets last Friday, and now she is doing it on all of her walks, even from a distance. I have never dealt with any reactivity from my previous dogs so this is a new thing for me and I feel out of my depth as she will grow to be a big dog. Any advice on how to go about this would be appreciated, I would go and sit somewhere and let her watch the world go by but people won\u2019t leave her alone even if I say no and block they try to go around me, I even had one woman go between my legs to pet her it\u2019s crazy and I think this is where the reactivity stems from.",
