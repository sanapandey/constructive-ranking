    "selftext": "So I have a 1-year-old labrador male, and I have had difficulty training him. Specifically walking him everyday, he pulls on the leash and I have hit my dog, I also have yanked him hard when he does pull on the leash as a way to get him to stop. First I wanna say that I am not proud of what I did, and I am going to hell for all this. Second I want to mend with my dog as I really do love him, and I don't want to hurt him but I can't control my emotions around him. Is there a way to try and mend with my dog?",
