    "selftext": "So first, I do not blame the dogs, I know it is their owners fault.\n\nFor reasons my family of 4 have had to move in relatives. We have 2 small kids. We moved in with 2 elderly ladies who between them have 5 dogs. 4 small breed 1 large breed. \n\nThe humans are old and sweet types whose's dogs do no wrong. They aren't house trained (well kinda they go where they please but get put out side often.) The dogs get treats for normal meals, along with regular dog food, and also given high value treats at request.\n\nI've gotten 2 of the dogs to warm up to me and the family, but 2 other dogs won't stop barking and being loud for anything that we do. And when they go off the rest follow. The current \"plan\" is just to give it time. The problem is that along with my small children come times I have to do stuff for them in the middle of the night, or open the door when the dogs owners are asleep. It wakes the whole house but I can't exactly tell my 1 year old to go back to sleep when she needs a bottle. \n\nThe dogs are mostly sequestered to one side of the house, but our room is near that aera causing them to go off often. \n\nI've tried talking the owners into do better with treats and/or praise and doing training. But they just won't hear it. They claim their dogs are just too old and used to the way they are to change. Which regardless of that, if the humans aren't willing to put in the work, it'd fail anyway. \n\nSo what I need help with is any other training method or idea to at least get them to stop barking when me or my kids walk by. \n\nWe also have 1 dog that we brought with us, but he is trained for the most part. He goes outside and is very food motivated. They are also feeding him treats without accompanying training, but we are setting those Boundaries and just keeping him with us when possible. The dogs don't get along, but they are separated and don't see each other. ",

Or something I can do to get these elderly ladies to train their dogs.",
