    "selftext": "Hello! \nAs stated above I have a Yellow Lab who my partner and I adopted about a year and a bit ago when he was just 3 years old. He's 5 now and inside our home he is genuinely the perfect dog. Loves cuddles, doesn't have terrible separation anxiety, doesn't dig in the trash or do any other destructive anxious behaviours on the regular (on the odd day while we were staying at a family members home, not his usual spot, he's done trash digging activities so he's not ABOVE it at all). \n\nBut it was very clear to us that he wasn't leash trained or taken on nearly enough walks before we adopted him, honestly it's part of why the previous owner had to give him up. Unfortunately due to this he's a bit of an excitable anxious mess on walks. When we first adopted him we lived in a very rural town where everyone's dogs were \"outside guard dogs\" (even if the breed was not made for the outdoors, straight up saw Frenchies left outside it was insane). He would be hyper aware when going on walks since almost every house had a dog out back, and if he barked even once (which he made habit of doing as soons as we would leave the house) the WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD would bark back. Anyway, he would get so worked up that if he saw a living thing, didnt matter human, dog, or squirrel, simply existing three blocks away he'd lose his mind and bark at them.\n\nThankfully we spent a LOT of time and effort working that out of him, and now a year and a bit later he MAINLY barks at dogs these days. I say mainly as for the most part he doesnt bark at humans at all anymore, but if he's particularly anxious on a walk he might let slip a bark or two at a mysterious human walking past, but in general he doesn't anymore. However we have since moved to a much busier location, an actual city now. We've worked his tolerance up to this point don't worry, we went from getting comfy in a rural space, to him being walkable in very suburban spaces (and genuinely doing a great job) but now we're in a fairly urban neighborhood and while he's doing MUCH better then he ever could have when we first got him, he's still horrendously anxious when a dog exists around him on a walk. And this is becoming difficult to handle since the city we live in is incredibly dog friendly so we can't not see other dogs on walks, there are multiple on every walk, and even on a quick jot outside to let him pee. It's making walking him feel like such a challenge, something my partner and I have been beginning to dread a bit.\n\nFor some final things, he is very well socialized INSIDE. His previous owner had another dog, a cat, and kids, so he is incredibly chill and wonderful when meeting other people, children, and dogs inside. He is also well exercised now. He was rotund when we first got him, but we quickly got him into shape by playing ball and frisby outside, and he truly adores playing these games. We're still exercising him enough in other ways, however an issue we have now is that we don't have a chill enough space for him to play ball or frisbee outside off leash without him getting worked up and running after other dogs or losing his mind barking at other dogs. Also when I say \"losing his mind\" i mean he barks like crazy, but as SOON as he gets to sniff them and meet them he stops. But since all he knows is to bark and since he sounds so aggressive at these other dogs its a 50/50 chance that he works that dog up and gets them aggressive, or they get scared and dont want to see him. He still gets to play ball and stuff when we go to my parents place since they have a backyard, but it would be nice to be able to play it with him again at parks close by.\n\nSorry, I know this is a lot, but I wanted to give enough detail to really paint a picture. How can I help him? We've tried just hanging close by to a local park and letting him witness dogs at a far enough distance so he doesnt bark, which is some advice i got from an article. But it's not really helping all that much, at least not yet. \n\nAny and all help and advice will be much appreciated, thank you for your time for even reading this.",
