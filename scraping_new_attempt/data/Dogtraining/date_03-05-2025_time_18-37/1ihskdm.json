    "selftext": "My dog is a Chihuahua mix I adopted from a shelter when he was 3 (he is now 6).\n\nHe came from an abusive home and was not house trained at all. House training went really well and in just a few weeks he was perfectly house trained.\n\nBut at the time, I had a doggy door and he was able to go outside at all times. I don't have the doggy door anymore. \n\nHe is still perfect during the day but at night he seems to need to go pee at least once if not multiple times.\n\nHe really really tries to not pee inside so he barks incessantly to be let out. He only pees inside if he has absolutely no choice.\n\n\nHe is on a schedule for his diner. He always go pee right before bed.\n\nI talked to the vet and he sees no health reasons (did blood work and UTI tests)\n\nMy question is, how can I help him spend the night without peeing?\n\nShould I let him bark? Could that help him? \n\nI am in a house  so neighbors are not a problem and I don't mind cleaning up in the morning, I just need to know it's the right thing to do for him.\n\nIs it possible he will never be able to stay the night without peeing?\n\nIt's been a few months now and would really like some advice, thanks !",

He knows not to pee inside and communicate really clearly when he needs to go out.\n\nThe problem is during the night, I can't supervise and I can't react to accidents immediately so I only clean up in the morning and move on.",
