She's had her 2nd round of shots and all dogs need to be vaccinated to participate. Does anyone have any experience taking their puppy to classes before being fully vaccinated?",

I\u2019ve seen a lot of new owners posting on FB groups about their puppies having health problems being exposed too early without all their vaccinations. \n\nAn alternative could be taking your puppy to new places with different sights, sounds, and smells to socialize them. You can do this with your puppy in a carrier or in your arms. Socialization doesn\u2019t actually have to be interactions with other dogs all the time.",
