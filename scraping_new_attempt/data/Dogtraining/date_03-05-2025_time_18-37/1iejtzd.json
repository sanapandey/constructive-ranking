    "selftext": "Hi, I have read the guide and this has not been covered.  \nI am trying to teach my dog the \"speak\" command. We want him to use it when we let him outside....so he learns to tell us when he has to go out.\n\nThe problem is that his 'speak' is like a noiseless chomp of his mouth. On some occasions, he will get some vocals behind it - and I very clearly reward him when he does. But sometimes, it's a faint use of his vocals. And when he does that, he seems to think he accomplished the task. If I do not reward the air chomp or quiet vocal, he gets frustrated and starts doing his other tricks (spin, sit, etc). \n\nI'm afraid I'm confusing him when I do not reward the subtle vocals.\n\nAdvice?\n\nVideo of the command in question - [https://photos.app.goo.gl/oXsCgCXF9F2o4r4p6](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oXsCgCXF9F2o4r4p6)",

Google \"poochie bells\" (they're cheap) and hang from a doorknob. Numerous YouTube videos on it. Best thing we ever taught our dog!",

When he barks, reward him. This is a command that is taught by frustration, there's really not much way around it.\n\nMy best advice is to just be patient. It's not the end of the world if he's a bit frustrated. Of course, if he looks like he's in actual distress, stop the session.",

Also we say \" SPEAK\" LOUDLY until we get the desired response, then reward. Additionally, our girl also used to do the noiseless chomp. We used that as a chance for a fun trick. We say \"SPEAK\" with the hand movement LOUD for a bark, and \"speak\" in a whisper for the no noise chomps,\ud83d\ude01",

It took me awhile to catch on to using a different \u201cspeak\u201d command word entirely so now sometimes when you ask him for either you will get both. he will spin and bark at the same time haha",

I haven't been able to experiment with this very much, but I feel like it's a bit difficult with a dog who doesn't bark much. I would use a bell or just sitting by the door, or putting the dog on a predictable schedule with a dog who doesn't really bark.",

            "body": "Bell ringing is better than barking, mostly because it's an otherwise non-existent behavior from the dog, save for what you train him to do it for: to be let outside. The dog could easily sit at the door and bark at any little critter in the yard he sees as encroaching on his territory, and it has nothing to do with needing to potty.\n\nAt the same time, when you're teaching your dog to ring a bell for a potty break, always take him out on a leash, directly to a designated spot he likes to use and don't talk to him, look at him, or interact with him in any way. If he doesn't go within a few minutes and/or stops sniffing around, sits, or lays down, he likely doesn't need to go and you should take him immediately back inside. Also, following a bell ring, you should always take him immediately back inside after he potties, to avoid accidentally teaching him that ringing the bell gets him outside play time, or worse yet, attention from you because you have to open the door for him. In this situation, the dog is going to endlessly ask to go in and out and back in again and back out again, etc., for that very reason.\n\nIf you suspect the dog is abusing the potty bell, you'll have to figure out how often your dog typically needs to pee (may involve some trial and error with accidents at first) with the general rule for puppies under 8 months old being 1 hour for every month of his age. If it's not close to this amount of time yet from the last time he went potty when he rang the bell, you know you can ignore it. If he's doing it just to get attention (asks to be let out and as soon as you close the door behind him, he wants back in, then back out, etc.) from you, consider whether you are giving him enough interactive playtime every day at designated times, as per his needs.",
