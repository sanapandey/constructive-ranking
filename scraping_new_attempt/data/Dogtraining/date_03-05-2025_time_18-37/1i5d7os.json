    "selftext": "I recently moved with my 2.5 year old dog to an apartment from my parents home. Since moving, she barks at every noise and reacts crazy to seeing any other dogs. She's never acted this way before and she was very calm towards other dogs before. We did training when she was almost a year old and was prepared to take the good citizen certification testing at that time. I can't leave her at the apartment for more than 15 minutes without her barking and howling like crazy. I try to turn on the tv to a doggy tv on YouTube to help her feel comfortable. We go on daily walks and I give her a lot of reassurance when there are noises. It has become frustrating and overstimulating, though I'm really trying to not let it get to me. \n\nAny tips? \n\nDoes she need to be treated for anxiety?\n\nThanks in advance! \n",
