    "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and I just adopted a sweet GSD mix. She is about 14 weeks old, and truly the best. \n\nWe\u2019ve been crate training, using high value treats in her crate, assuring it\u2019s the right size, etc. and it\u2019s been going okay! But we\u2019ve realized she\u2019s only okay with the crate as long as one of us is also in the room with her. The second we leave, she whines, barks all that. We work opposite schedules so 90% of the time someone is in the room with her. \nI want this to be her safe space, and I\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to develop some anxiety around the crate. Any advice on how to move forward? Thank you! ",

I try to fold laundry/ clean the room whiles she\u2019s in there to help and let her free after.",
