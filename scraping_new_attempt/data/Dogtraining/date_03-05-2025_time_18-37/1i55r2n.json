            "body": "Even if it\u2019s labelled as a waist leash, you should *really* be sizing it to your hips because that\u2019s where it should sit. Your waist is squishy and full of important organs, if the dog pulls it\u2019ll hurt! Whereas having the leash seated on your pelvic bones means it\u2019s in a place that won\u2019t compress and can take the squeeze force, plus it\u2019ll be at a lower centre of gravity which is a big plus.",

Also I don't think a pull will really be squeezing organs, it's not as if if the belt is tightening when pulled so isn't the more likely issue hurting your back? Which is an issue I am definitely keeping in mind while I research this purchase.",

Remember that the leash is super flexible, so the circle around the waist will try to deform since it\u2019s not a solid object like a barrel hoop.  Depending on the size of your dog this pressure may or may not be significant - you can pre-test it by knotting a cord around your waist and getting someone else to pull on it with the same force as you\u2019ve felt your dog is capable of in the highest pressure/emergency situations. Work up to sharp, unexpected yanks, since those can\u2019t be braced against.",

Also I think that is the point of canicross types, to spread the pressure around. I don't think tying a rope would be a great test but I can look for something else wider and stiffer like an old belt maybe.",
