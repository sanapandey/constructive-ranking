    "selftext": "We adopted a dog from the local shelter about a year and a half ago. She came from a house where she was abandoned, and our city press charges against her previous owner I guess. I don\u2019t know too much else about the situation except that she was chained up outside without food and water. She was extremely fearful of us in the beginning, but has come to be really loving and sweet and trust us completely. Guests, on the other hand, are a different story. In the beginning of having her, when we had guests over, she was hesitant, but didn\u2019t bark at them. Overtime it seems like as she\u2019s become more comfortable with us she started resource guarding our home, and is fearful of anyone who comes near it. This is people who come into our house as guests, or even people walking in front of our house, or noises, she hears in the backyard. When she becomes fearful of people, her hackles raise, and she starts barking. Recently, she even lunged at one of our guests, which scares me that she might bite. She\u2019s super food, motivated, and has come really far in learning how to walk on a leash and be around us because of food, so I\u2019m wondering how we can use that to help train her when we have guests in our house. Or, is using food all the time not a good training method? When we have guest over, we have gotten to the point where she will sit down and stop barking and take a treat from either us or the guest, however, she always moves back into that uncomfortable state and begins barking again shortly after. Any advice on how to help our baby get over this fear would be greatly appreciated. :)",
