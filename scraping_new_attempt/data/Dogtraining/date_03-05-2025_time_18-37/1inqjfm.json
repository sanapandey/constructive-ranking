    "selftext": "Our 3 yr old schnoodle usually sleeps in his dog bed in the living room at night with minimal barking and problems. As an aside he absolutely hates the neighborhood deer and goes crazy when they are around our house or the neighbor's house. He can sense them even when all the window blinds are shut. \n\nRecently a large pack of 10+ deer has taken to sleeping in our neighbor's yard. And our dog goes crazy all night. None of us are sleeping as a result. We tried to put him in the bed with us but he is eager to roam the house and continue his fearful behaviors. Would like people's opinions on reintroducing a crate or any other techniques to help. Thanks in advance. ",
