    "selftext": "I recently moved in with my fianc\u00e9 who has a 4 year old German Shepherd who has received basically 0 training. Since we moved in together we have successfully transitioned him to sleeping in his crate at night and I've taught him a few commands. He is mostly well behaved, but has a huge problem with whining. \n\nI understand typically with whining you want to ignore the behavior. I also understand that in severe cases of whining it's important to get the dog more structured exercise.\n\nOur dog gets to a level 10/10 intensity with his whining when we are about to take him outside for a walk or to go to the park. This includes extreme volume of whining, jumping, pulling, and in some cases barking. \n\nI don't want to reinforce this behavior by taking him on a walk when he's acting like this, but we also know that getting him out and exercising him properly will be helpful in managing this problem.\n\nTips on what to do first/how to manage this situation? Thanks!",
