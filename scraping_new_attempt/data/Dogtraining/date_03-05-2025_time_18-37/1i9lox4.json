    "selftext": "I have an 11-year-old Yorkie Mix whose behavior has increasingly become more aggressive. I have hired animal behavioralist, dog training classes, clicker training, high value treats, and attempt to redirect his focus and break the aggression in those moments. \n\nNothing has worked and his behavior has gotten worse with each passing year. At this point nobody can come or go from the house without being attacked. Although he is 5 lb he is still a liability and at worse he has drawn blood by small nips and have torn clothing on friends, family, and even us. He loves car rides but now if we take him for a ride where I need to get out of the car he attacks me by biting and barking.  \n\nFor the last 2 years we don't answer the door to anyone that stops by unexpectedly unless it's absolutely necessary. And when we do this we have to pick him up and move him to another room while being bitten and shut the door for the duration of the visit. Afterwards he will not calm down and is on high alert for hours afterwards because he knows somebody was here. This is particularly a nuisance since we have retired neighbors that love to drop by in the middle of our work day which wreaks havoc for the rest of our day. It's a huge issue when we have landscapers, pool service, and pest control visits as he knows someone is on the property.\n\n If we do have planned visitors coming over that he is not typically aggressive towards, what I mean is he's okay with them in his space after the initial entry into the house. However, we have to watch the camera for their arrival so we can take him outside and pretend it's a potty break so he doesn't attack and will be chill for the visit. We do the same before they go. \n\n\nI have tried thunder vests, pheromones colars, trazodone, other sedative drugs the vet have prescribed, and we still can't get his anxiety under control. If we have to take him to the vet or grooming he has to be sedated. He wasn't like this until he was about a year and a half old when I had him neutered.\n\nI just don't know what to do and I love my dog so much. Any helpful recommendations would be appreciated. I honestly feel trapped in my home and I have to tell friends that I wish I could invite them in or to come over but my dog is aggressive. \n\n\nI was told that an e-colar might be helpful but I'm worried it would just train him to be anxious over wearing a collar.\n\nPlease help!

                            "body": "It sounds like your dog is anxious and stressed most of the time, his cortisol levels will be so high that chronic stress will be leading to him being unable to learn. \nWhat did you do with the behaviourist in the sessions? How did the dog behave? What management have you put into place so that your dog doesn\u2019t need to be put in the stressful situations?\nStair gates in door ways can be really helpful to keep an anxious dog farther away from something that it finds overwhelming while potentially feeling safer because they can still see what\u2019s happening. \nIs the dog happier at the back of the house? Away from the front door so that when the door bell goes it\u2019s already away and you don\u2019t have to pick up the dog. \nI\u2019d really really recommend seeking anti anxiety medication from your vet. Sometimes it takes a few different medications to get the right fit. Also a pain trail. It\u2019s when you give your dog a pain medication for a few months to see if the difficult behaviour gets better. If your dog is in pain and you\u2019ve never realised, then their stress levels will be considerably higher which can lead to these kind of behaviours. A pain trial could indicate if that\u2019s the case by potentially treating that underlying pain, while you use management to stop the dog being put in situations that it cannot handle. \nJust because you can physically pick up the dog and move it out of the way, doesn\u2019t mean that you should. The dog may be telling you that they\u2019re in pain and don\u2019t want to be picked up, or so stressed in that moment that their only option is to bite. Please use management to ensure you change the environment. Put a sign on your front door that tell people not to ring the bell. Have them text you when you arrive. Then you can calmly get up, get a yummy treat for the dog, give it to them behind the stairgate and close them there away from the visitor, then go to the door to see who\u2019s there",

If so, and medication, along with behavioral modification work, hasn't helped, it might be time to think about BE. There are times when behavioral euthanasia is the kindest thing we can do. It isn't what we hope for, but when the dog exists in a constant or near constant state of heightened awareness, frustration, and anger that isn't alleviated with any of the things tried, it's time to think about taking that frustration and anger away in the last way we truly want to.",

You can purchase \"bite gloves\" online to protect your hands also. Take the time to get him adjusted to the muzzle if you can, otherwise it will increase his anxiety, but there are some great tutorials online. The Leash, compounded with some strategically placed pressure gates in your home will help with the overall anxiety as well. There is nothing that says he needs to have free reign of the house, and sometimes, even with adult dogs, making their world \"smaller\" helps. The pressure gates are great because no one is trying to step over them, and they are not expensive.\nYou have probably checked this, but just in case, if this happened after his procedure and is getting worse, has the vet checked that there wasn't a nerve or some other type of damage done accidentally that is causing pain? The vet would have to look for tender/painful areas specifically to see if there is something wrong that is pushing him over threshold that much faster. Hope this helps.",

Dogs can be mentally ill. You'll often hear people say that \"the dog is not wired right\"\n\n\nThere is absolutely no good can come from an e-collar for aggression. It was almost always make it worse. Especially if the aggression is coming from a place of anxiety / fear. \n\nYou should consult a veterinary behaviorist. Medication can help but it may take weeks to kick in. And if the first medication doesn't work you'll have to wean him off and try a different one.  Medication is not necessarily a cure-all. It can actually make dogs worse. \n\nThat leads to the more difficult discussion, when is it time to let a dog go over the rainbow bridge when every day they are in mental anguish.  Absolutely have to discuss this with your veterinarian.  \n\nI belong to a group on Facebook for those who are or have considered behavioral euthanization. For the most part the dogs are bigger than a 4 lb Yorkie. Just because the dog is only 4 lb does not mean it's not capable of doing some damage.",

In the US, that title should be used only by veterinary behaviorists (vets with advanced behavioral training) but some trainers (particularly balanced trainers) call themselves that. \nAn e-collar will definitely make this worse. \nHas the dog been checked for pain? \nWhen you say you try to \u201cbreak the aggression\u201d what do you mean? Counter conditioning is supposed to be done before the dog starts to react. For example, my dog became dog reactive. If we were 50 feet away he wouldn\u2019t react, so we reinforced looking at dogs calmly from that distance, then decreased over time. If he started to react, that was my fault, I pushed him farther than he was ready to go.",
