    "selftext": "I got a puppy 3 days ago and he occasionally growls at me. He's 3 months old and I'm pretty sure he's homesick. He'a been hiding under my bed since he got home. I failed to get him proper toys and a crate his first day home, I got toys his second day, and a crate yesterday. I think he likes his crate but I'm not sure, I don't know how to understand him. The responsibility of caring for him isn't hard for me but getting to know him is. I've never had a dog before, everytime I think we're making progress and he's getting more comfortable, he growls at me. It's very confusing because when I'm away he cries but when I come in to let him know its ok he'll stop whining but will let out a small growl at me sometimes multiple. Whenever he growls at me I leave the room for a bit, then he goes back into hiding. I really don't want to be damaging to him, any advice would be appreciated. I'm calling the place I adopted him from today for advice. He's getting vaccinated this week as well.",
