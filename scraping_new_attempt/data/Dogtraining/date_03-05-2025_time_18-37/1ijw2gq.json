I\u2019m looking for participants to fill out a quick survey\u2014**it only takes 10-15 minutes**.\n\nIf you\u2019re a dog owner, your input would be incredibly valuable to my study. Your anonymous responses will contribute to better understanding training and behavior in dogs.\u00a0\n\n[https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/rvc/trainingpracticesandbehaviordifferencesindogs-survey](https://app.onlinesurveys.jisc.ac.uk/s/rvc/trainingpracticesandbehaviordifferencesindogs-survey)\n\nThank you so much for your time and support! Feel free to share this with other dog owners who might be interested.\u00a0",
