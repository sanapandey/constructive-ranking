    "selftext": "I should\u2019ve done more research before buying a puppy and a bigger breed. My last dog was smaller. Had a very low energy level and just liked being near me. She sadly passed away. I waited a while before I got another dog but I didn\u2019t do much research she is now about seven months old and her energy level is so high it\u2019s unbearable. Every time we\u2019re walking around the block people avoid us or they make a funny joke about how impossible she is to walk or how we are leaning to the side because she\u2019s pulling so hard. I\u2019ve taken her to two different vets and every time we  go to the vet, they say how insane of an energy level she has it that they have never seen it in their 20 years of experience. One of the vets called her crazy Remi and it stuck and that was since she was like seven weeks old. It\u2019s like every week she gets older, she gets even more energy. It\u2019s so embarrassing. I want to do some thing to help. I just don\u2019t know what to do. She is a golden retriever, and her name is Remi, I take her on three long walks a day and it doesn\u2019t help! I have a bunch of toys to try to stimulate her. I\u2019ve tried mental stimulation as well with like puzzle, feeders, and stuff. I\u2019m tired of going out in public and everyone looking at me like I\u2019m crazy and avoiding me. She LOVES to be around people and dogs. She loves everyone but no one wants to be around her because her energy level is so high and it never stops. People ask does it stop when you\u2019re at home? No, it literally is 24 seven. I know I have to go get her trained somewhere but even if I do, I don\u2019t think that will help with her energy level. I could take her to dog daycare, but all these expenses start to add up. I don\u2019t know what else to do. Nothing would make me give up on her. She\u2019s my dog since the day I got her but it gets really frustrating sometimes. Like why me??? People don\u2019t understand how hard she pulls. I felt like I was fighting with a gorilla when I was waiting in line at the vet because I had to fight her from trying to go see people and go see all the other animals like I literally had to brace myself against the wall and hold her with all my might and I\u2019m not a small person so I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. After leaving the vet, my arms are sore seriously everyone was laughing at me in line. It looked like I was fighting with a gorilla. She\u2019s only 53 pounds. I need some ways to get her energy out that I haven\u2019t already thought of, or tried, or read about. I need advice on what to do?? I will take constructive criticism but please be nice. Also she\u2019s getting spayed today. That\u2019s why I was at the vet.",

Plus the Additional Resources listed at the bottom.\u00a0\n\n3. \u00a0I would look into this sub/group\u2019s support/advice/megathreads about loose leash walking.\u00a0This is the method I used,\u00a0\n\u00a0see my comment [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11rq8fo/help_with_listening/)\n\n4. \u00a0I would do a trial (one) online session with an [ACVB or CAAB trainer](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709) to judge whether additional sessions might be helpful. \u00a0\n\n5. \u00a0Next vet visit I would call ahead and ask if There is an option to enter your vet office from a side or back door.\u00a0\n\n6. \u00a0On a temporary basis, I would drive my dog to deserted areas rather than use populated areas to walk my dog.\u00a0\n\nI would not recommend doggie day care. \u00a0Your dog sounds overstimulated.\u00a0",
