    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I have a 6 yo chihuahua who has always been super friendly, zero aggressive that now has become pretty aggressive towards myself (I live in an apartment just with him). He gets mad when I try to lift him, he no longer sleeps in my room, and his behavior has completely changed. Everyone tells me is \"normal\" for chihuahuas to have a temperament, but the thing is that this is happening just towards me, not anyone else. Can someone help me with this? what im I supposed to do to revert this situation?   \nThank u in advance!",
