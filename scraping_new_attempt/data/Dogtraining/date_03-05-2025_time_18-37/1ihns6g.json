    "selftext": "I'm looking for a solution to our dog waking us up nearly every night because he wants to come in our bed. He might stay in our bed all night, or he might decide to jump off and return to his crate sometime later (again waking us up.)\n\nHe is a 27lb 4yr old King Charles Cavalier, neutered male with no serious health issues. Overall temperament friendly but skittish, and is somewhat noise-reactive plus some anxiety but nothing severe.\n\nSome background: he is entirely attached to my wife (39F), following her around everywhere all day. He has never any consistent training, as we got him during COVID lockdown and shortly thereafter found out we were pregnant with our first child.\n\nFrom puppyhood, he slept in bed with us because he would whine and cry while in his crate. Sleeping with us stayed the norm until our second child was born in April of '23, after which he successfully moved to sleeping in his crate at night. He would only ask to be let out of his crate at night if he had to go potty, which occurred maybe once every couple weeks. His behavior changed a few months ago after an acute illness and overnight hospital stay, which led us to where we are today.\n\nOur sleep setup is as follows: his crate is right next to my wife's side of the bed, and is covered by blankets to keep in warmth (front left uncovered for airflow.) We have lots of white noise in the room, and it's very very dark. I don't think it's because of cold, as he will happily sleep above our comforters.\n\nAs a result of this behavior, I have started sleeping in another room to avoid being disturbed at night -we have two toddlers and quality sleep is at a premium. What kind of training will help with this?\n\n  \nThank you!",
