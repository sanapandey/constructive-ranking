    "selftext": "I did check the wiki and it mentions that dogs will see parts of the house they aren't normally in as fair game to go toilet, however it didn't really say how to address this.\n\nI usually stop her (8 month old cocker) going up there unless i'm up there as well, in which case she doesn't wee or poo. However as soon as she manages to get up there without anyone with her, she will straight away go and wee on the bed and leave a poo on the landing. I'm starting to think she's doing it to spite me lol\n\nI have also noticed when i put a new wee matt down in the downstairs room she's always in (i have to for my partners dogs as she won't house train them) she will usually go and do a massive wee on it, i've never caught her in the act, but the wee is massive and our other dogs are tiny maltese's.\n\nShe was completely house trained before all this and i stopped going outside with her / giving her treats for going toilet a while ago.\n\nWould would be the correct course of action?\n\nI'm thinking maybe start from scratch - Take her out at set intervals, get her to go toilet, praise, treat.\n\nAlso, perhaps playing with her more upstairs and on the bed... Although i feel like more is needed to stop her but not sure what.",

It is likely to go much much faster than the original training process, though, because of the prior housetraining.\"",

I\u2019ve never used one, but they could be good if they\u2019re used the right way.\n\nYou just put it down somewhere (preferably just one), and kind of teach them to use it. Once they\u2019re used to it, you slowly start moving the pad towards the front/back door and after a while, you remove the pad. The dog will look for it at the door and if their owner is quick enough, they\u2019ll see it as a sign that their dog has to pee or poop, and take their dog out as quickly as possible. Positive reinforcement is really important here, and the dog will eventually learn: if I go to the door, I can go outside to do my business and I\u2019ll get rewarded for it",

Unfortunately it's not viable for me to clean the upstairs hallway with an enzyme cleaner as my partners dogs just wee there daily (don't even get me started on how bad it is). \n\nI will try starting again with the basics and hopefully that will help.
