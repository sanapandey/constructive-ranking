    "selftext": "My girlfriend and I failed foster an 8 year old (we think) Teckel Dachshund roughly 3 months ago. She is very sweet, treat oriented and has NOT been castrated yet. (She will be once 3 months have passed her last season)\n\nOnce a week, she just wanders into a small room and pees on the floor. Even after getting walked within the last 2 hours.  We think we are doing everything right, just looking for some advice\n\n-She has in the past contracted a UTI which has been resolved. \n\n-She also goes on 3-4 30+ minute walks and runs to the garden. \n\n-We have used an enzyme cleaner or two in the spot where she goes to pee \n\n-We reward her for peeing outside and whenever she pees inside we run her straight outside. \n\n-She has sat next to the door in the past to indicate that she needs to go out. \n\nWe are thinking about going to a behaviouralist about it but we are looking for any suggestions before that. \n\nThank you in advance ",
