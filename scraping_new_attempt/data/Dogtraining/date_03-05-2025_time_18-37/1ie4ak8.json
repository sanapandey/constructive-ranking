I have tried travel sickness tablets, she has shown a slight improvement to vomiting with these.\n\nI am planning on taking her with me on a 2 month trip in May to Spain from the UK. I would do the journey in my car which would take around 2/3 days including stops and sleeping.\n\nAny advice on training for long-haul journeys? Or how to make her car experience more comfortable. Sedatives are the last resort. ",

            "body": "Does your dog ride in a kennel in the car? This is what I would recommend. It's the safest option and will make your training easier as well. \n\nMake sure your dog has peed and pooped before taking her in the car, and stop frequently for her to relieve herself. At 5 months old, you need to have very low expectations for bladder control, and if you want to avoid her peeing in the kennel, you should plan to stop roughly every 1-5 hours depending on your dog. \n\nStart by teaching your dog to be comfortable in a kennel outside of the car. Throw a treat into the kennel and when she goes to get it praise her and feed more treats inside the kennel. Practice leaving her alone in the kennel for increasing durations of time, starting with very small amounts of time (30 seconds) and building up to a few hours. Once she is comfortable in the crate, progress to helping her feel comfortable in the kennel in the stationary car. Practice being lifted up into the kennel, feed multiple treats in the kennel, then take her out and play for a few minutes. Repeat several times daily for several days. Next practice starting the car, driving around the block, and going right back home to play with her. Build the duration. \n\nIf you can get a helper to train with you, have them feed her high value treats during these short drives. \n\nI know it's not ideal, but you may also want to consider having her stay with a family member or friend, or hiring a pet/ house sitter. A 2-3 day trip is a lot for such a young dog, and May is coming up quickly. \n\nTLDR: Use a crate, put in the work with training, and make sure to stop frequently. \n\nBest of luck, I hope you have a wonderful trip and happy training!",
