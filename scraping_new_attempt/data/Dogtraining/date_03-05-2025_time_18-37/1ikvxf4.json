    "selftext": "I have a 1-year-old spayed female Boxer who wasn\u2019t socialized early, except with my other two dogs. She\u2019s very fearful of people and other dogs\u2014she even shakes when she sees people on walks. We live in an isolated area with little exposure to others.\n\nTo help her, I enrolled her in a one-month training camp focused on socialization. She stays there during the week, and we pick her up on weekends. It\u2019s been two weeks now, but she still seems extremely uncomfortable. At the facility, she has her own room, but the place is very noisy with all the other dogs constantly barking.\n\nWhen we brought her home for the weekend, I noticed she had lost weight, seemed exhausted, and was very hungry\u2014almost as if she hadn\u2019t been eating due to stress. At home, she gets very scared and agitated when she hears another dog barking in the distance. The trainer believes her fear might be genetic but says she\u2019s slowly improving and should continue with more socialization.\n\nI\u2019m worried the experience might be too overwhelming for her and it may be counterproductive. I feel bad seeing her this stressed, but I also want to help her become more comfortable around people and dogs. Should I continue with the training or try a different approach?",

Since we don\u2019t have many opportunities to socialize her here, we thought a training camp would help. However, it now seems like it might be too overwhelming for her.",

You need to read our wiki page on fearful dogs and go ultra slow, like seeing people/dogs from across a football field and then calmly walk away type of slow.",
