    "selftext": "This is my first post here, so I hope I've tagged the appropriate flair. As the title says, in about a week I'll be having some dental surgery and as the stay-at-home partner, I'm the one responsible for caring for our pup. He's nearing 1.5 years old, floats around 65-70 lbs, and is somewhat active but rather good at settling when he needs to. Anyway to keep the post as brief as possible. He has a well-fitted Rabbitgoo harness which I use for walks. He is comfortable in it and is used to it enough to even sleep in it the couple times I forgot to take it off after a vet visit. After my dental surgery I will have a few days where bending to put on his harness will be unadvisable, and my husband works his restaurant job from open to close, which is why I'm the main caretaker for the dog in the first place. Using just his collar for walks is out of the question. He is young, very strong and fast, and in fearfulness/reactivity training. If he bolts because of something I don't see, I don't want to damage his trachea or spinal cord.\n\nThe plan we discussed was for hubby to put the harness on the dog in the morning, leave it on him for morning shift in case I need to take him outside, then while husband is on break (he comes home for an hour lunch break every day) he will remove the harness and give him about an hour break before putting it back on and leaving for dinner shift. It'll be about 10-11 hours total in the harness,  and after hubby comes home from work, he'll be the one doing dog care until bedtime, and he's much more comfortable using just the collar. It all will of course be taken off overnight. And will only be necessary for 2-3 days while I need from the initial surgery.\n\nSo I guess my question is, will this be safe for doggo? The harness fits well, he plays in it and can relax fully, I haven't noticed any cold limbs/digits or chafing with this harness ever. Thanks for any input folks have! And if I used the wrong tag, please let me know!",

I have read all the topics and guides, as well as browsed all the wikis, and I have also searched the subreddit for a similar topic but couldn't find what I'm looking for. I recognize that it's not ideal for dogs to live in their harness, but it's just for a couple days and only while husband is at work so I'm just looking for a little discussion on this. Thanks! I'll also be considering asking in the ask vets sub as soon as I can find it \ud83d\ude05",
