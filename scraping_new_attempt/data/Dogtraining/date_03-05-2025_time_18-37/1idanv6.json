    "selftext": "**Edit: we had our first day with significantly reduced barking after playing multiple sound machines in every room of the apartment. We assume it was all territorial or alert barking and she was picking up on a lot of sounds that we could not hear. And/or maybe the amount reached a point that caused her anxiety as well and it turned into some amount of anxious barking. Not sure this will be a sustainable long term solution for us but definitely is working for now!**\n\nI recently adopted a dog that we believe could be a mix of any of the following: yorkie, shih tzu, and/or maltese. She is 5 years old. We live in an apartment and believe she never lived in an apartment before.\n\nWe believe she is doing a lot of territorial barking, but sometimes it seems more random and compulsive and we need help identifying the potential reason of these longer extended bark periods, which can last 1-2 hours, once or twice daily, where she barks at most every few seconds, and at least every \\~3 minutes.  They range from small yaps to bigger high pitched yowls. When we hear a trigger sound from the hallway and she barks, we have been working on teaching her quiet after the first bark and rewarding/praising/thanking her, or simply genuinely thanking her for alerting us. This works a lot of the time to reduce the barks to 1-2. Playing sounds of door knocks/closing/footsteps does not seem to bother her, only the real deal! However, some times it seems as though she barks for genuinely no reason, or the alert bark extends past initial trigger for a very long time and no longer seems to be in response to the trigger. I have tried taking her to the hallway to show that there is nothing or having her watch me check and thank her, which doesn't work.\n\nShe barks looking towards the direction of the door and then sometimes references us, or sometimes just at us if we're in a room further from the door, but the perceived threat is long gone or non-existent (that we can perceive). The \"quiet\" cue does not work (it works but not long term, even after extending the wait time between saying quiet and a reward to up to 10 seconds, after a few seconds or minutes she barks again). There is no window into the hallway so nothing to minimize/block in terms of her view.\n\nWe think it is not an attention-seeking bark because she usually barks and sits directly in our laps if it is attention seeking. Also, giving her attention does not resolve the barking. We have tried cuddling, playing fetch, and snuffle mat with treats (she will even bark during these sessions in between bites!) these work short term and then she returns to the barking. We have also tried moving her to different areas of the house/further from the door, playing music, white noise, tv, etc. which also don't work long-term. We don't think she's expressing a need to go out as it often happens even soon after coming home from a walk. We believe she is not bored, she gets 2-4 hours of walking or running and fetch/toy enrichment daily. She denies some of these things during these bark sessions as well, including running away from her harness/ leash when presented. This is in contrast to when she barks and we present her with the harness which stops her barking and she gets very excited.\n\nThe only thing that has actually ended an extended session aside from her eventually falling asleep is when another household member comes home. However, even on days where we both are home the entire day, she can have a barking period like this which is why we don't think it is separation anxiety. She also barely barks when one of us leaves the home.\n\nWe know she is still taking time to adjust and are trying to be patient. We have her first vet appt to rule out anything medical and also get their opinion later next week. We don't see other behaviors that have clearly indicated it could be anxiety or pain but are open to exploring that more. She can spend cumulatively up to 2-4 hours a day barking like this which poses quite a challenge. We were told she was \"crate trained\" to a carry bag that she gets into by herself. She does get into this bag to sleep/rest at times, but then jumps out when she hears a trigger sound or barks from the bag.",

            "body": "My little guy was much the same. He was eventually diagnosed with generalised anxiety with one of the manifestations being noise sensitivity. White noise machines helped to a point but his hearing is so good of course, he can still hear a neighbour cough three doors down! Because of his anxiety, he is now on medication which has given me the space to train. He is sooooo much better now. From barking for hours every day, he now only barks occasionally if someone is at the door or walks right past. He resettles quickly. It's early days for you guys and great that you are getting a pain check. I read somewhere that with noise sensitive dogs, it is very often pain-related. Good luck!",
