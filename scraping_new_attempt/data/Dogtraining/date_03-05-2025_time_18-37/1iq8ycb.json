    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMy husband and I adopted an 8 month old male puppy with an unknown past about two weeks ago, and it\u2019s come with some challenges. He\u2019s working through some trauma and learning to trust us, and has generally been getting along with the 3 other dogs in our home (1 male and 2 females, all 4 dogs are fixed). However he has started to show his teeth at our youngest female dog when on the couch if she comes near. Last night she came near my husband sitting on the couch and he snapped and lunged at her, then today they\u2019re outside playing in the snow together like nothing happened. I am not sure if being near my husband and I are the trigger, the couch alone, or a combo of both. A trainer recommended keeping him off the couch, but I\u2019m just not sure how to approach that when both humans and all 3 dogs are sitting on it and we have to kick and keep him off. Do we make him lay on the floor? Put him in his crate? Everyone move off the couch? Get a collar and buzz him whenever he starts to show his teeth?\n\nI\u2019m kind of at a loss for how to handle this, so any help would be appreciated!",
