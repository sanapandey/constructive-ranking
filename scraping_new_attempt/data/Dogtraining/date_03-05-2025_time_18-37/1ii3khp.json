    "selftext": "I work full time and my Grandma watches my dog for me while I'm gone. Whenever she takes her on walks and she sees a person sometimes she's fine but other times she'll jump at them and be super protective of her. The other day she took her out people came up and pet her and when they were walking away she bit one of their hands.\n\nShe never pulls any of this when I walk her, she always walks on a gentle lead (regardless of who is walking her) and doesn't pull much. Whenever we walk by people she just looks at them and she is a little tentative at most if people pet her. \n\nIt's really hard to know what training to do for her if it works when I do it but not for my Grandma, I'm absolutely out of ideas and I don't want anything to happen while I'm working. What should I do? ",
