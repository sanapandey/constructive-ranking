    "selftext": "Hey! I got married about four months ago and my wife has had her blue heeler for 8 years. We live on a ranch and have about 150ish head of cattle. He is a super smart dog, however he is a massive doofus. Due to lack of time and training he doesn\u2019t do much with cows. He spins them in circles and just causes issues. I\u2019ve been working with him, my only experience is helping friends and their dogs. He is different than any other dog I\u2019ve worked with though. (Worked with is a loose term, I\u2019ve taught friends dogs tricks and stuff but by no means any training or any true experience. I just like trying new things and the challenge.) We are currently night calving so we\u2019ve had time to work with him. I\u2019ve taught him how to spin, sit and wait before coming inside (and sometimes before going outside but we don\u2019t enforce this like we do with him coming in), he knew how to sit and lay down, he heels and will follow us but is pretty easily distracted and needs reminders semi frequently. He is still a fairly hyperactive dog even though he\u2019s older. Because of this he struggles with focusing even when we\u2019re training. I\u2019ll keep reading because I saw the part about hyperactive tendencies and stuff. Was more so curious if there\u2019s any good recommendations on how to continue his training to maybe even being able to be in a field with cattle and not leave us, or even just stay put and not worry. Also wondering how far I can go with training him? He\u2019s definitely ingrained with some habits (ie when he sits or lays down he circles around you and sits behind or next to you like 3/10 times) so what are some good places to start or is it worth taking the time to try or should we just leave him be because of his age? Thank you! I\u2019m open to anything!",

Or the ABCs of problem solving?",

We don\u2019t do leash training because we are out in no where Montana so there was no reason to, however I was thinking about starting. That\u2019s another reason why I reached out here! I didn\u2019t see the training section thank you! The hiking sections aren\u2019t available to me, I think that\u2019d be the closest thing to us working in the fields. Just looking for some guidance! Thanks.",

Some heelers actually aren't a good fit for herding. Others might be better on sheep than cattle. If you're interested, an instinct test would help you figure that out. If herding isn't his thing, there may be other activities you can interest him in (frisbee, nosework, obedience, agility, etc.). Also, you can work on his focus and self-control.",

            "body": "You need to work on his reactivity. It seems like emotional impulses take over when the right kind of stimulus becomes present: \"Oooh! A bird!!!!\"\n\nStart in a minimally distracting environment, in the house where there are no distractions and no one else is around. Get some high-value treats that he likes, but that are also not greasy; he'll be getting a lot of them and you don't want him to get diarrhea. Freeze-dried fish bits are great; so is a boiled chicken breast cut into bite-sized cubes.\n\nStart by calling his name and giving him a treat every time he looks at you after calling his name. Repeat this at least a few dozen times (over multiple sessions). When he has that mastered, progress to asking him to sit and, if you want, lie down. Give him a treat every time he does, following you asking him to, and keep popping him treats for as long as he keeps sitting, giving him \"good boy!\" praise with each treat. Try to vary the amount of time between each treat so you don't accidentally teach him that he can get up if there is no treat. If he gets up, stop the treats for just long enough that he'll know getting up was wrong, but ask him to sit again for a treat before he loses interest in the training.\n\nGradually start adding distractions, little by little. These might be things you can physically add to the scene, or you can move to more distracting places. If he seems to regress, go back to the last level of distraction for the next few training sessions. Eventually, take this practice outdoors (maximum distractions). Ultimately, you'll end up with a dog that you can reliably call at any time, and if he can hear you, he'll sit and wait for further direction from you, no matter what is going on around him.\n\nFinally, keep your training sessions short but frequent; they are exhausting for the dog. Keep them to no more than 10-15 minutes per session (your dog will let you know when he's had enough, usually by just stopping responding to your cues), and no more than 2-3 sessions per day. In the meantime, let him out to explore if it's safe enough for him; otherwise, he'll learn to hang out behind the fence just fine for the time being.\n\nGood luck!",
