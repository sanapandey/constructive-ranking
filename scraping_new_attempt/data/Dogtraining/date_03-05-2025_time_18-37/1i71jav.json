    "selftext": "I have a 1 y/o standard goldendoodle. For a puppy, I\u2019m actually very proud of how good his behavior is. He\u2019s a really sweet and well behaved boy! I (25f) and my boyfriend (28m) live together. When my boyfriend is here, all is well. Our doodle doesn\u2019t really bark at anything. Maybe occasionally, but nothing out of the norm. When I am home alone, my doodle is barking incessantly at everything. We live in an apartment complex so any time he hears someone in the hallway, keys jingle, a door open, he is barking like crazy. He stares out the window and barks at all the people getting out of their cars. A barking episode probably occurs every 15 minutes. I have also noticed this is more common at night and not during the day. I work from home during the day and he is peacefully sleeping, but in the evening he seems much more on guard. Is this a thing? It could be that there\u2019s just more foot traffic in the evening. \n\nI assume he feels the need to protect me more since my boyfriend isn\u2019t home. Once my boyfriend comes home, he doesn\u2019t bark at everything outside anymore. It\u2019s not that my boyfriend commands him not to bark, he just doesn\u2019t even do it in the first place when he\u2019s home. He is no longer staring out the window barking at people. While I appreciate this gesture, and I do think dogs are the best deterrent to crime and he makes me feel safe, his barking episodes are too frequent and I am getting headaches. How do I reduce this or train him out of this? I don\u2019t even know how I would approach this! \n\nAlso, my neighbors thankfully don\u2019t hear him. We are in a high rise so we have concrete in-between units. I can\u2019t hear my neighbors and they can\u2019t hear us, we did check in with them and asked if they could hear his barking, to which they said no. You can just hear movement in the hallway. So it only annoys me, thankfully! ",
