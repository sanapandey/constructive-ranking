            "body": "Marx does not address this (to my knowledge). Sraffa addressed this for prices and called it \u201cjoint production\u201d. For joint production, with Staffa\u2019s approach to prices, it requires another industry that produces wheat seeds but not wheat or produces wheat but not wheat seeds (this is because to calculate the n price unknowns, there must be n linearly independent equations\u2014which equations are the mathematical expression of the industries). So it is a stretch scenario for your example I think.\n\nIt seems reasonable in your example to make the 5 hours shared equally across the two commodities. So 2.5 hours for 5kg wheat and 2.5 hours for 10kg of wheat seeds. That\u2019s  0.25 units of value per kg of wheat and 0.5 units of value per kg of wheat seeds (if my dyslexia didn\u2019t sabotage my calculations). \n\nSomeone might come up with other reasonable justifications for other than an equal split (such as separate industries producing separate joint products they can be compared with the industry for your inquiry), but in the absence of such justifications an equal division seems reasonable to me.",

                    "body": "yeah i think it is that way. as long as the total amount is 5 units i guess the producer can atribute any price to the wheat and wheat seeds.  \nif there is another industry which produces only wheat seeds the price of the wheat seed would be determined and the price of wheat would be 5 - 10\\*(price of kg of wheat seed)/5kg of wheat.",

You want to produce different grades, such as wholemeal and white bread flour. The value however is not evenly split, since white flour involves more sifting and more machine work. Your labour may not increase, but the labour contained within the machine as value increases and so the value of socially necessary labour is slightly higher for one product than the other.",
