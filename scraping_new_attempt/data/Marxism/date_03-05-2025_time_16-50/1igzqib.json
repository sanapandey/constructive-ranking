    "selftext": "I am curious if anybody has any thoughts/articles on how the American mode of production has changed with de-industrialization in the 70s and 80s. \n\nObviously, the ruling class has not necessarily changed to a large degree, but the working class has definitely. I\u2019m curious if there are any analysis of how the change from industrial proletarian workers to information-based (can they be considered proletarian?) workers and how that\u2019s affected society.\n\nThanks :)",

            "body": "The simple reading is that it continued on the Taylorist line, except that the design and production offices moved even further apart to separate continents. Braverman's *Labor and Monopoly Capital* is the no-bullshit seminal reading on the separation of planning and doing. It's notable that the military-industrial complex has driven at least two major enabling changes in manufacturing technology: numerical control, as examined by Braverman, and the Mead-Conway VLSI design revolution. As a result of these and similar industrial decouplings, the handle of the tool has been returned to the worker in an alien form. Contract manufacturing plus general purpose computation plus free and open source software enables skilled amateurs to design simple digital integrated circuits today and receive physical devices next year \u2014 for around $100. \n\nFor a more detailed look at the new exploited class, McKenzie Wark's *Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?* experiments with the idea of a nascent mode of production in terms of an information political economy, and the necessary changes to attend to the material differences in the commodity that make the result not exactly capitalism: for example, wealth presents itself as an immense accumulation of *information about* commodities, information is valued for its uniqueness (unlike the farmer or worker's units of sameness) because the marginal cost of a unit is closer to 0 than 1, information capital is exploited through the hacker's inability to exploit knowledge, and so on. Today, contract manufacturing allows a designer to develop a product on their kitchen table and have one, a thousand, or a million units made, 100% digitally. Information about capital (process parameters, job lore, production schedules and quotes, how the consumer walks/clicks through your retail space, etc.) becomes critical to its effective use. A different subordinate class which she calls the \"hacker class\" produces unique information, but does not have the means to realize the value of that information. That is held and exploited by a \"vectoralist\" class (e.g. celebrity technologists, managers, investment banks, IP owners, etc.) who have an exclusive right to practice certain processes or access particular information.\n\nNone of this necessarily replaces capitalism, however. In civilization, previous modes of production continue to exist and interact with each other: there is still a petit-bourgeois craftsman class mainly because the bourgeoisie likes their distinguished positional goods too much to quit 'em, tenant farming is still around, and even slavery still exists \u2014 notably in the form of penal labor so loved by petit-bourgeois reactionaries. Most likely these modes will continue to coexist and exchange as the new mode unfolds, unless something very unexpected happens.",

I wouldn\u2019t call it a change in the mode of production itself, it\u2019s still capitalism. \n\nNo longer relying on domestic manufacturing but instead exploiting the global south for manual labor so that the imperial core can enjoy cheap commodities. See third worldism. \n\nAmerica transitioned from a manufacturing economy to a service and tech based one. None of this means that the American proletariat loses their proletarian status. Still working class, but the work is different.",

There wasn\u2019t enough jobs retraining or trade/tech schools. The educational system pushed hard for business finance and accounting jobs rather than tech. \n\nThe US became neoliberal gradually starting in the 1970s/80s, much like other countries. That\u2019s the ideology behind the policy to deliberately push for de industrialization. I say the US would\u2019ve de industrialized quite a bit regardless because by the 70s, the workers had organized into unions for higher pay and there had been quite a bit of neocolonialism by then. \n\nInformation based workers can still be considered proletarian and the US lags in getting the populace ready for an Information Age. Some IT workers can be classed as the labor aristocracy. These are paid very high salaries to keep them submissive to the system at best or even anti labor at worst. This extra money to pay the labor aristocracy can stem from neocolonialism and deregulation of the economy. \n\nThe possible results will still be the same imo. Capitalism has been proven to not be permanent and the US is certainly in the midst of changing economic systems, accelerated drastically by poor economic policy. But we don\u2019t know yet what new system the people will want to replace capitalism.",

            "body": "Capitalism in Decay ended and was replaced with Dynamic Capitalism. Computing technology revolutionized industrial technology and caused everyone to shift back to capitalism, including socialist countries. This changes how the social classes have developed since the 1960's.\n\nProletariat strictly means the workers who own none of the means of production. But because of computing technology, industrial workers are no longer low paid wage workers. They have greater control over production, have greater skills, and get better pay as a result. This shift of control and higher wages causes the industrial workers to become the Petit Bourgeoisie. So they can't be regarded as Proletarian at all. The Petit Bourgeoisie will have Proletarian tendencies, like establishing labor unions, but they still can't be considered Proletarian because their interests ultimately lie with the Bourgeoisie.\n\nSo the US workforce shifted to higher wages and began Bourgeoisization. And thanks to Imperialism, consumer products as well as means of production have become cheaper. Even the lowest paid service workers, like fast food workers, earn enough money to buy some form of the means of production like cars, computers, and machining tools. So the US has very few people that we could call Proletarians.\n\nThis is why there is very little radical shift going on in the US. They keep their politicians near the center, with slight shifts to the left or right, but they eventually re-center. Workers also don't regard unions as working class institutions. They regard unions as a means of reaching the middle class.\n\nMass Bourgeoisization of the workers is also why imperialism carries on without any opposition. The Petit Bourgeois workers in America won't fight for the interests of the exploited Proletariat in the global South.\n\nMass Bourgeoisization is also why China implemented things like social credit. Dynamic Capitalism caused industrial technology to rapidly shift in a way that industry can't accommodate the masses of workers. So Lenin-style socialism is no longer feasible and Mao had to shift back to capitalism and transition the workers to technical professions. Deng's reforms were a continuation of that process. But the fear is that the Chinese Proletariat will transition to the Bourgeoisie so the Party has to implement social controls to preserve their Proletariat. So even though the mass of Chinese workers are in Bourgeois professions, the hope is that they will maintain their Proletarian class character.",
