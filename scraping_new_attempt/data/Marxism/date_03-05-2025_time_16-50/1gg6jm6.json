    "selftext": "Quoting Losurdo: \"Marx, who knew phenomenology very well, resolves the difficulty by corresponding (in the Critique of the Gotha Program) the two different ways of declining 'equality' (which is always partial and limited) to two different states of development. of post-capitalist society: in the socialist stage, distribution according to an 'equal right', that is, reciprocating with equal measure the work provided by each unique and always different individual, produces an evident inequality in remuneration and income in this sense; the 'equal right' is nothing other than the 'right of inequality'. In the communist stage, the equal satisfaction of different needs also entails an inequality in the distribution of resources, but the enormous development of the productive forces, fully satisfying the needs of everyone, makes such inequality unimportant. In other words, in socialism, material equality is no longer possible;\n\nBut what about natural limitations? Well, let's imagine that there is a huge development of the productive forces, this will require the ever greater extraction of natural resources from nature, resources that today we see will soon end (such as oil) how can we deal with this? \n\nFurthermore, I really have difficulty understanding how the market logic will completely overcome. Who will define what my \u201cneeds\u201d are? Since items are no longer bought and sold but distributed, I imagine there will be a body to determine what everyone's \"needs\" are, but I really can't see that working ",

            "body": "In the section where this axiom is written, Marx is building a case against the ideas of the early parts of the Gotha Program, specifically:\n\n> \"Labor is the source of wealth and all culture, and since useful labor is possible only in society and through society, the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society.\"\n\nand\n\n> \"The emancipation of labor demands the promotion of the instruments of labor to the common property of society and the co-operative regulation of the total labor, with a **fair distribution** of the **proceeds of labor**.\"\n\nHis arguments are effectively summarized in two forms. One, that the \"proceeds of labor\" can not \"belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society\" due in part to the nature of production and the cost of maintaining production levels and expanding production levels. While also requiring proceeds to be set aside for maintenance of societal goods, such as education, healthcare, and general welfare. Two, that the distribution of the proceeds of labor can not in any sense be deemed as \"fair\".\n\nHis arguments against the fairness of this distribution are that this \"socialist\" society (which Marx calls, \"a lower stage of communism\") will be colored by the existing bourgeois notions of \"equality\" and \"rights\", specifically notions of \"individual equality and rights\".\n\n>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.\n\nHe makes the case that, because of this limitation of this \"socialist\" state and its close relation to the previous capitalist state, the distribution of the \"proceeds of labor\" will be unequally distributed.\n\n>Hence, *equal right* here is still in principle \u2013 *bourgeois right*, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.\n\n>In spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is *proportional* to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an *equal standard*, labor.\n\n>But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This *equal* right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only \u2013 for instance, in the present case, are regarded *only as workers* and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.\n\n>But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.\n\nAnd this is where we find our axiom:\n\n>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2013 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\n\nWe have to read this in its full context. Marx is saying that, true equality of life can only be achieved when:\n\n>\"labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly\"\n\nLabor is \"not only the means of life\", meaning the process in which you sustain yourself, but also \"life's prime want\" meaning, to labor would be the only \"want\" you desire, meaning that laboring isn't just an end to a means of living, but is the goal of living. \"after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly\"\n\nMarx is describing what the highest stage of communist development would be like. One where each day you wake not to the demands of those who control the means of production, but to your own demands, and those demands can be satisfied due to the co-operative wealth you have access to. \"Only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety...\" that bourgeois right being the right of the individual to privately own more than their needs \"...and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\"\n\nSo what does Losurdo have to say, from your post:\n\n>In the communist stage, the equal satisfaction of different needs also entails an inequality in the distribution of resources, but the enormous development of the productive forces, fully satisfying the needs of everyone, makes such inequality unimportant. In other words, in socialism, material equality is no longer possible\n\nWhat Losurdo is saying here, is in this higher stage of communism, resources will be distributed unequally, but due in part to the productive forces of this stage, everyone's needs are met, and as such it renders the inequality unimportant. What is important is that the unequal distribution results in \"satisfying the needs of everyone\".  He then rephrases his point, \"in socialism, material equality is no longer possible.\"\n\nI think the point that Losurdo is trying to make here is that the goal of Material Equality is a red herring. The axiom, \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" In no way implies an equal distribution of resources to people. People need Food, Clothing, Shelter among other things, and depending on the place you exist in the world, you need more Food, Clothing, or Shelter than other places in the world. Marx's conception of Communism is one that is a world order, one where the entire population labors collectively to ensure all the people live free and fulfilling lives. It's a world without borders, and a world without a \"state\".\n\nSo I don't believe we should be worrying about if \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" is \"even achievable\" because it won't be achieved in my lifetime, or even my grand children's lifetime. It should be seen as a kind of \"north star\", a goal under which we as socialists strive to achieve.",

You're asking a question that gets deep into philosophy, history, and economics.\n\nBut, I would make a few points, with the aim of encouraging you to go back and more closely read Critique of the Gotha Program.\n\n\"From each according to his abilities\" etc. is described by Marx as a distribution principle that can *only* become society's main distribution principle *after* socialist *production* has not only established itself, but has become deeply engrained into people's habitual lives so that their *intellectual* (emotional, spiritual, etc.) lives come to reflect it deeply. And alongside this, many changes have taken place in the realm of economic development.\n\nSpecifically, Marx places the society which that \"slogan\" represents as being possible only after:\n\n\\* The separation between mental and manual labor has been abolished\n\n\\* Individuals are no longer subordinated to the division of labor\n\n\\* Productivity has been greatly increased\n\n\\* Work -- all work --has become an activity which exercises and positively develops *all* of the workers human abilities and senses, an activity which intrinsically benefits the worker rather than sacrificing the worker's humanity for the sake of maximizing output and minimizing costs. As Marx phrases it, \"work has become life's prime want\", that is, the most enjoyable thing you could imagine doing with your time.\n\nOnly *after* these achievements have been conquered, Marx says, can society adopt this slogan as its principle of distribution.",

            "body": "Leaping to the overcoming of market logic is likely premature. It puts the cart before the horse. Since we do not now know what allocation mechanism will supersede market circulation, it is best for the sake of discussion now to stick with markets. If and when we supersede markets it will be because we have found a superior way to allocate resources. \n\nThe more important distinction is that between capitalism and socialism/communism. If we achieve that revolutionary transformation, the specific mechanisms for allocation resources will pale in comparison. Even allocating through socialist markets\u2014allocating according to ability and willingness to pay\u2014 will already be far superior to capitalist markets where ability to pay is determined by one\u2019s position to exploit the greater mass of works and to pilfer the common treasury of natural resources (ability to pay determined in socialism according to constructive contributions to society rather than as in capitalism according to malicious anti-social detractions from society).\n\nI see two possible meanings of \u201cneed\u201d in Marx\u2019s _Critique of the Gotha Programme_. One is the idea that the dramatic development of the forces of product will render scarcity a thing of the past. Such development of the forces of production can also lead us away from exhaustible resources and towards entirely renewable and reusable resources. For example, rather than relying on fossil fuels, the hydrogen economy takes abundant water, breaks it down into oxygen and energy carrying hydrogen, which then in using the energy carried emits water again. This is only one example, but we could imagine a world where all natural resources used for means of production participate in such a renewable cycle. In this sense \u201cto each according to need\u201d implies a common treasury of resources \u2014natural and produced\u2014from which any person can withdraw whatever they themselves deem the need. Because scarcity is eliminated, take whatever you need.\n\n\nThe second meaning of need might involve, thinking in terms of socialist markets, a threshold poverty income. Though we might utilize only renewable natural resources, those resources might remain scarce nonetheless (as in the demand exceeds the supply at a zero price). Scarce renewable natural resource will thus require a positive price to allocate according to one\u2019s ability and willingness to pay: a rent. \n\nSince these natural resources come from the common treasury for all, the rents from selling these natural resources will likewise accrue to the common treasury for all. As producers produce, with natural resource means of production, they will be held accountable for the scarce resources they productively consume by paying rents to the common treasury. The equal distribution of these rent revenues thus creates an Unconditional Universal Basic Income (UUBI) social dividend (SD) that even today, with current material conditions, might very well exceed any reasonable poverty threshold we might calculate. That means that before each of us gets out of bed each day, our _needs_ are met by this social dividend. If we do not already reach this poverty threshold with the current material conditions, we will eventually reach it as the forces of production develop: at least until the phase when scarcity begins to evaporate entirely. When we find new superior allocation mechanisms to supersede market circulation, we will still enjoy these _distributions according to need_ achievements discernible through market allocation.",

Larger planning bodies should probably propose maximums on resource use rather than minimums. Production in a communist society I personally think would often resemble a food forest more than a factory but would be organized in such drastically different ways that its hard to picture. And your needs are heavily informed by the society you live in.",
