    "selftext": "I am a relatively new leftist. If I'm beong honest- I fell in hard and have been using Chat GPT to learn more about the questions I have. I love what I'm learning about marxism, socialism, and even anarchy, but I was wondering where an individualist marxist would fit into the \"political compass\" of socislism.\n\nLet me explain, I understand that barebones marxist theory predicts that capatalism will collapse and we will someday become a communistic society. Personally- I'm not there on communism, I worry that a collectivist society sounds repressive, and I feel that places like cuba, who executed its gay population- did so because they felt the \"gay identity\" has no place in collective society.\n\nI do like marxist and socialist ideologies- but if I'm being honest- collectivism is a concept that I'm just very icy too. Can someone explain where individualism's place in marxist society could lie?\n\n(P.s. I'm new to this sub, I'm new-ish to this way of thinking, but I feel that I've finally politically activated and I'm seeing the world through a new lense that finally makes sense. If I said something stupid, please correct me and explain. I'm here to learn but I'm rusty)\n\n(For more context, I'm a U.S. citizen, white male 28, I'm appalled by capatalism, I have an anti-borshuasee mindset, I understand the conflict between them and the Proletariat, I feel passionate anger about colonialism, inequality, homeless, racism, sexism, bigotry, and I fully understand how Capatalism is a big part of the root cause- so much so that I can't even vote for Harris because Dems/libs piss me off too. I was raised conservative, became a lib, is now far-left, I think Trump is a fascist. Since seeing the world through a marxist perspective I feel sickeningly enlightened/obsessed- but ultimately wiser as a person who sees a truth kept hidden from me all this time. Weirdest of all, my value/love for humanity has somehow increased in the most bizzarest of ways- considering that I feel some of whats been happening is monstrous. Everyone has a worth far beyond monetary value- and its sick that we assign humans \"worth\")",

Take what it says with a grain of salt. \n \nYou\u2019re right saying Marxist know that capitalism will fall but after it does, socialism will emerge as the dominant economic system. If we survive the fall of capitalism, we, our children, and probably our grandchildren will be living in a socialist society. The socialist society will have some remains of capitalist society while\nMoving towards communism. Like how capitalism now has aspects of feudalism which came before it. \n\nindividualism is one of those values of capitalist society that will remain in the socialist society that comes after. over time (or ideally through a cultural revolution) it will diminish. \n\nAll this is to say that your subscription to individualism is a byproduct of being raised in a capitalist society (bourgeois ideology) and you should work to unlearn that. It\u2019s not really compatible with Marxist principles ( and as you will see on this subreddit, we love our principles). \n\nAlso Cuba didn\u2019t kill gay people, that is imperialist propaganda. Cuba actually has the most progressive constitution atm",

Interestingly- ChatGPT has actually been pretty helpful, but I think I might be asking my questions in a pointed enough way to get a non-biased responce. The reason I've come here however is that I think I need to hear more people telling me that my perspective is flawed- rather than hearing from a bot that co-opts my perspective in a way I want to hear. The truth is- a marxist perspective is a hard pill to swallow- it hurts to confront a reality where such terrible atrocities have been commited and covered up over, and over again. Its hard to hear that I ate the erasure and propaganda. I was actually raised conservative- then I turned liberal- and now I find both groups sickeningly wrong.\n\n\nbut I'm proud of myself for liberating my own mind this far. Maybe soon I can push a little further.",

You must learn not to take anything from capitalist sources as credible. That story is a fraudulent, and grossly hypocritical (look into the Lavender Scare), version of events.

I know there's plenty of writing on religion in Marxist theory, but I've not read any of it myself yet. \n\nI'm also an atheist, depending on how you define that. I was never raised religiously.\n\nI think it's uncontroversial that any communist/vanguard party itself should be internally secular, if not explicitly atheist. I'm fairly certain this has been very true historically. The level to which a communist party should be externally anti-religious is much more controversial, but I tend to agree that it shouldn't be. I think for a few reasons. \n\nI think Marxism would reject the idea of theology taking state power. At least it wouldn't really frame it in that way. How familiar are you with the concept of base and superstructure? Basically, the base is the economic structure of society and the superstructure is the culture that grows out of that (as well as holdover superstructure from previous economic bases, which is related to the whole homophobia bit). Religion/theology is a thing of the superstructure. One that feudal society heavily relies on to justify itself, which explains a lot of the USSR's history with religious institutions.\n\nSo even if there was something that looks like a theological takeover of the state, there's something underneath that, which would either be a bourgeois or feudal counter-revolution. \n\nSo the question turns into how does a communist/socialist/Marxist/proletarian/whatever state protect itself from bourgeois/feudal counter-revolution? And that's the whole question isn't it? That's at the root of much/most \"leftist infighting\". Anarchists refuse (their own, different definition of) a state at all, which Marxists would say disables them from defending against any kind of counter-revolution. Trotskyists assert an all-or-nothing global \"permanent revolution\". LeftComs might be avidly any-religion, idk. I think MLs are in favor of atheist vanguard while making sure religious institutions don't foster counter-revolutionary action, but are otherwise amicable towards religious institutions. \n\nI've heard that the Black Panther Party organized with their local churches to better help their communities.",

More of my own musings as someone who never knew spirituality growing up and am curious about exploring it now. \n\nI constantly see questions about spirituality but rarely see people take the time to define how they're using those words. \n\nTo me, it seems that spiritually is the exploration of things of ourselves and experiences that cannot \"properly\" be explained. Like what is consciousness and the \"self\".\n\nReligion seems an organized version of that. If I had to guess, probably rooted in classed society. \n\nThe issue is that now someone has control over how people understand themselves, rather than it being a fluid community-driven thing.\n\nSo like, Catholicism was one of the ideological underpinnings of the feudal monarchy in the same way that Liberalism is to capitalism.\n\nI think this is why many Christians cannot comprehend how atheists cannot have morals. Because people have morals, but Christianity takes that innate human experience and teaches people it actually comes from their relationship with God or Jesus or whatever. They genuinely don't understand that they'd have a moral compass regardless because they've been taught it comes from something external. And that allows the church to have control over their moral compass. \n\nThe issue is that religion is absolutely inseparable for many people's sense of self-understanding and community. To be anti-religion is a direct attack on those communities and even an attack on the individual's understanding of themself. \n\nAnd all the good that comes from spiritual practice (as in, the practice of understanding ourselves) doesn't just go away when it's organized into a religion. Taking that away is harmful on every level.",

I just started Losurdo's book \"Liberalism: a counter-history\".\n\nMy disclaimer is that language prescriptivism is always bad and never constructive. When almost anyone says \"liberal\", they're using it in a way that's explicitly exclusive of conservatives. They mean generally socially progressive, in line with the Dems, etc... It's important to understand what the speaker is trying to say rather than correcting their language. I usually assume people mean \"progressive\" when they say \"liberal\".\n\nThat out of the way, yes, that's what I've gathered. \"Liberals and conservatives\" is the same as \"drugs and alcohol\". A couple simple ways I like to demonstrate this:\n\nWe need a word for someone who's supportive of capitalism. Many/most say \"capitalist\", but then we need a word for someone who owns capital. The word for that is capitalist... the word for someone supportive of capitalism (sometimes more actively than others) is liberal.\n\nReagan (and Thatcher in the UK). Conservative golden boy. Ushered in *neoliberalism* to US politics. So, Reagan was a (neo)liberal. And a conservative.\n\nThey're not mutually exclusive. I'd say they describe different things. I'd think \"progressive liberal\" vs \"conservative liberal\" is probably a more accurate way of saying \"liberal vs conservative\".\n\nAnother way I like to think of it:\n\nCatholicism was (in certain areas/times) the ideological underpinning of feudalism. The reason people believed that there was some lord that \"owned\" they land they lived on and had the authority to tell them what to do was the Catholic church taught them those lords were ordained by God and deserved to own the land and all that.\n\nLiberalism is the ideology that teaches us that some people deserve to own the means of production (factories, tools, materials, land) and that we all have to work for them to get a little money to buy stuff from them to live.\n\nIt'd be real silly for someone to claim they're against the feudal monarchy, yet whole-ass believe everything their clergy teaches. Same is true of an \"anti-capitalist\" liberal.\n\nWhich reminds me of something I've been thinking. Communists (the ones worth listening to) aren't communists because they study communism, but because they study capitalism (which is what Marxism is).\n\n\\>is fascism under the umbrella of liberalism too? Or is that just a progression that tends to happen?\n\nI do not know. I think you'll likely find quality answers on both sides of that. I've yet to actually read Marxist literature on fascism. My vibe is that fascism is inherently reactionary, and thus impossible to define. It feels like fascism is distilled liberalism. Fascism isn't actually its own thing as much as the opposition to anti-capitalism.\n\nWhich, there's an argument to be made that communism (ML if you ask me) is the only historically proven anti-capitalist ideology/movement. Which is where you get the \"secret third thing\" joke. \"Oh I'm not a communist or a fascist; I'm a secret third thing\" (which is something that's historically shown to either directly support or passively enable the rise of fascism)",

Communism does not force us into collectives. Rather it insists that when collectives arise, we have free and equal role in the administration of those collectives. For example, we are a part of the natural world, but with our conscious minds we confront that natural world inherently as a collective. We require a faithful agent to act for us in the stewardship, administrator, and proprietor (in common) of the natural world. In communism, the collective that arises spontaneously stewards it concern collectively. In capitalism and other exploitative and tyrannical social formations, tyrants administer the collective\u2019s concerns individually (as a monarch) or in small groups comprising a ruling class (oligarchy: specifically plutocracy in plutocratic capitalism). \n\nWhen workers join together to produce, they form a collective. Communism does not force the workers into this collective. Communism merely insists that the collective so formed be administered to allow the collective of workers to appropriate the fruits of their collective labors collectively.

Or in other cases we elect to form collectives. Communism merely insists that such collectives, so formed, must treat the members of the collective equality with equal liberty, equal self-rule, and equal dignity and respect. Since capitalists benefit from the exploitation they force upon us, it is the capitalist who force is into collectives, we would not otherwise form, to facilitate their exploitative gain.",

I spent 20 years living and working in anarchist and Marxist communities before I ever heard the term \u201ccollectivist\u201d.  \n\nI think the current terms present individualism as \u201cthe needs of the individual are paramount\u201d vs collectivism as \u201ca system where the needs of the collective or community override the needs of the individual.\u201d\n\nBut what this ignores is that every individual is deeply enmeshed in a culture and that the organizing principles of this culture have a massive influence in the health, safety, and growth of the individual. \n\nSocialism started long before Marx as the idea that we could organize societies in a way that maximized individual liberty, autonomy, and health. It was created in response to early capitalism that organized on the principle that the individual right to own property is the highest possible value. The result of that capitalist philosophy was an incredible amount of oppression and destruction. \n\nMarx took this OG concept of socialism, which has since been relabeled as utopian socialism, and added economic and social analysis, and invented what today we call Marxism. \n\nMarxism has been a factor in a number of successful revolutions, but those revolutions also inherit the flaws and biases of the earlier system and so can also be prone to oppression of minority viewpoints. As an anarchist, I\u2019d say some of those inherited flaws include things like orthdoxy and the application of strict hierarchies, the necessity of a strong centralized state, the idea that a strong central state can be a force for good, and the idea that this state would eventually voluntarily give up its power to empower a greater individual autonomy.",

Culture and religion play a significant role in homophobic violence, not just political decisions; (ii) Collectivism does not necessarily mean authoritarianism. There have been democratic collective societies and economies that were not communist throughout history. Looking into the histories of Indigenous societies in North America/Turtle Island might help you in your studies, and you could also look into the enclosure movement in England and the transition from feudalism to capitalism (see E.P. Thompson, Marx, English enclosure movement/common land); (iii) Collectivism and individualism are not necessarily the opposites. In some ways, a collectivist society/economy allows people to better realize their individual goals and dreams; a shared responsibility for the greater good can alleviate alienation and allow individuals to feel more of a purpose and validity in their work and life.",

It sounds like you're growing, and part of growth is letting new information change you. Collective good and individual good are interdependent.

So, forsaking collectivism because you value individual rights and individual wellness is self-defeating. Right now, you aren't equipped to find your place in Marxism because you don't understand it. I would highly recommend taking the time to read some basic theory (not chat gpt) before worrying about sorting yourself into a subgroup of Marxists. Chat gpt is not only biased because it reflects back what you want to hear (like you identified) it also lacks true intelligence- the information it gives you is just a regurgitation of the material it was trained on, and it was trained within a capitalist system that presents many distortions about socialism and socialist countries as fact, so it can only do so much. It can definitely quote or even summarize Das Kapital but if you ask it about history it'll just give you western propaganda. You can also supplement with leftist podcasts and youtube videos (searching for these in this sub should yield enough results to get you started) for when you're not quite up to reading but still want to learn. I find those are especially nice for getting an idea of how Marxists today think and apply theory to current events. Hope this helps!",

Communists tend to come at it from a collectivist angle, but are ultimately very concerned about the wellbeing of the individuals that comprise the collective.
