That said I am certainly sympathetic to a lot of what Karl Marx wrote nor am I a McCarthian that shakes and trembles at the word \"communism\".\n\n I am curious of what yall think of a certain other Jewish German political philosopher named Hannah Arendt. For me a she is one of those thought leaders that really sticks out to me from the last century so I am curious what this subreddit thinks of her or even has heard of her? \n\nIf this the first you've heard of her, I would recommend \"Origins of Totalitrianism\", there is a short paper she wrote featured at the end of the Book titled the same the is short and a good read. If you enjoy that I recommend the book as well and then \"The Human Condition\" another great but mega dense read. \n\nHope my post doesn't break any of the subs rules, have mostly been lurking",

Arendt's work is generally reactionary, in service of imperial hegemony, and she was an anti-Black racist (see: her book 'On Violence'). 'The Origins of Totalitarianism' is worth reading for the single reason that Marxists should read everything so they know what they are arguing against.",

Could you expand on \" work is generally reactionary, in service of imperial hegemony\".  \n\nI would say 'The Origins of Totalitarianism' is great descriptor if not some times accurately describing current western cultures conversations on terrorism. Also, it felt like she was very direct with stating modern European Fascism was cemented throughout its long-history of racism, imperialism and antisemetism. So, Ill have to check out \"On Violence\". \n\nAlso, I wouldn't dismiss her work entirely. I mean, you probably wouldn't have read our boy Karl if we had such a standard for all authors/artists even just past the last half a century.",

That said, they pretty badly misrepresented her position in the Little Rock essay so I'm still gonna hold off judgement until I get the actual context in the text. My suspicion is that, because Arendt is first and foremost an institutionalist, her disrespectful attitude towards Africa is born of political snobbery alongside an incuriosity that allowed her to imbibe the surface level rhetoric of her age. That's not exactly flattering and it caused her to say racist things, but I'm not sure it justifies the claim that anti-Black racism is a primary motivator of her thought. \n\nWhich is reinforced by her more nuanced language regarding Black Americans. Her contention with civil rights leaders seems primarily to be a tactical and philosophical one, not an opposition to their ends. In this regard she presents essentially the best articulation of the White moderate position King despised. I disagree with her conclusions because I am, like King and Black political theorists of the era, not an institutionalist. Or at least recognize that institutions are not pre-cultural. \n\nThat said, she was, in the Little Rock essay a vocal and unequivocal supporter of Black integration into public space and businesses, and of interracial marriage. In modern parlance we would say that she believed social integration was a prerequisite to the kind of cultural integration implied by integration of the schools. Which, while I disagree with her opposition to enforced integration, she wasn't wrong! Seventy years later and school integration in most parts of the United States still hasn't meaningfully happened, while social integration has been far more successful. \n\nHer response to Baldwin's Fire Next Time is the perfect encapsulation of the tension between Arendt and the American Black political movement. She had seen the disintegration of social institutions by mass movements lead to the destruction of her people. She dedicated her life to understanding how to match institutions to humans worst desires so that it could never happen again. \n\nBaldwin had watched institutions exploit, abuse, and control his people for centuries. He dedicated his life to showing us that solidarity, love of human beauty, and a willingness to fight to preserve that which one loves can overcome even the most powerful institution.\n\nThis is the key tension in leftist movements and Arendt was the perfect counterweight to Black political theorists excellent articulation of their position. My understanding is that y'all like dialectics. If that's to be more than a shallow intellectual exercise, then you have to find value in those thinkers who, even diametrically, oppose you with skill and nuance. \n\nWas Arendt racist? Yah for sure, I mean, everyone in this country is. Is it a defining or even consistent theme in her work? Not really. Does it mean she's categorically wrong on racial issues? Also no. I would not trust her analysis of Africa at all and I would approach her analysis of American race relations with healthy skepticism, but I would not characterize her as an anti-Black racist any more than I would most of her white contemporaries. \n\nI would instead characterize her as a liberal who was genuinely sympathetic to racial justice but who believed it came second to the preservation of a stable democracy. While it might be technically true it would be like labelling Lincoln or Rawls an anti-Black racist in the first line of their bio. Sure, if you're asked you can defend the position, but it's just not a fair description of the nuances with which they approached the topic or the importance that orientation had in their work.",

I digress. \n\nI never really got the impression from any of her work she was a racist in any classical or even insitituional sense. I think we feel power to judge people in history based on a set of morals we hold now. \n\n This counterwieght as you mention is an interesting sort of position. Two marginilized groups, one movements goals are radical insitutional change whilst for the other that lead to... well.... Mind you this not mean to discredit the validity of either movement and have found a lot of crossovers in the American Civil right movement (am EU pleb so catching up)",

To me, here we can certainly draw apt comparisons in regards to Nazisim. Stalins view of the Jewish population and the following mechanisms of propaganda at play were very similar to that of Hitler's Germany. From the doctors plot, denial of assimilation, protocols of zion, and painting them as capitalists.\n\n> anti-Semitism \u201cwas merely an accusation that Jews used to silence criticism and squash free speech.\u201d He brought libel lawsuits against newspapers that accused him of anti-Semitism, and won them.\u00a0\n\nThis wasn't in USSr, this was actually Hitler. But in lock-step with Stalins mechanisms of even the act of calling out anti-semetism is an act of injustice. So there are many ways that the comparison can be drawn. But sadly people willingly or unwillingly include this blindspot or just don't want to engage.\n\nAgreed on the difference on Arendts work. Another commenter and I also saw her more as an institutionalists. As with the quote example, there was the degradation of these national institutions that in certain part lead to the industrial halving of Hannah Arendt's people.\n\nIdk to me the hubris of it all is just whats odd about it.",

If your contention is that \"totalitarian\" is essentially a slur used against states to which the West is opposed, I agree.

When, of course, they aren\u2019t. This is what we call \u201cmaking up a concept, pointing to two things in the world, and saying those are the same.\u201d\n\nThe book also says that Totalitarianism is novel in that it attempts to terrorise whole populations instead of only political adversaries, so as to whip the people into shape, when in material terms, we know that isn\u2019t what happened in the Soviet Union, and neither in Nazi Germany honestly.\n\nSupposedly, Totalitarian movements would attempt to control every single aspect of the life of their subject, and this would be why Hitler and Stalin were Totalitarians and Mussolini isn\u2019t, because Mussolini would \u2018just be an autocrat\u2019 who wants to subjugate their political opposition.\n\nMany people would mention that she forgets a spooky thing called\u00a0**slavery**, that did the same thing.

For instance, she mentions that the Nazis weren\u2019t really interested in murdering all Jews; instead, those were simply a convenient proxy - a 5-minute hate, if you will - to whip up your population. Therefore it\u2019d be comparable to any famine from the USSR, since the intent would be similar, according to her. This fundamentally misunderstands the Nazi project in a futile attempt to draw a line between two different things for political purposes.\n\nBottom line: Hannah Arendt created Cold War propaganda to try and equate the old enemy (Nazi Germany) with the new one that was finding itself in the Korean War (Soviet Union). Liberals gobbled this up because they\u2019re scared of big words like \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d, and therefore she had a ton of success. Her theories ignore the political violence of the state and of capitalism because, in her liberal mindset, these weren\u2019t actual violence, but instead just the way the world works. This flies in the face of everything the Third World ever tries to accomplish, because revolutionary violence wouldn\u2019t be justified.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like a \u201cbig-tent\u201d propaganda, you can take a million conclusions out of this, and it\u2019s been deeply influential, and it\u2019s been deeply influential in keeping the ruling class in power with ignorant intellectuals like you.\n\nYou can see Hannah Arendt's anti-African bias in the section of the text entitled 'The Phantom World of the Dark Continent' in the second part, on 'Imperialism', of The Origins of Totalitarianism and you can observe her against the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas in the essay called 'Reflections on Little Rock' clearly demonstrating that she is not against private property and its control of parents over children to marginalize another part of the population instead of having solidarity in organizing together with other workers, therefore the only freedom that Hannah Arendt defends is that of the bourgeois with capital. She has no solidarity with the oppressed classes in assuming power and expropriating the oppressor classes by spreading the lie of totalitarianism which is reactionary and anti-Marxist nonsense.\n\nI can put a link with examples for you here:\n\n[https://xcancel.com/aiukliAfrika/status/1063203765082304512?s=19](https://xcancel.com/aiukliAfrika/status/1063203765082304512?s=19)[](https://lemmygrad.ml/u/archive_bot)",

                                    "body": "Well see, I am actually. Which is why I don't follow authors, unlike you lot. I engage with their work and learn what I can from it. While I disagree with her conclusions I have learned a great deal by following her thought process. She is excellent at reasoning through politics as a cold endeavor designed to trap and channel the most destructive human instincts. If you wish to help build a truly equal socialist society, such a perspective is indispensable. \n\nYou have, I'm sorry, bastardized her thesis. She identifies a specific form of movement which identifies nebulously defined and subtly powerful internal enemies at the root of the people's ills. It then forms a party to contest that enemy, but in doing so simultaneously becomes a policeman for values. The party gains ubiquity in private life, dominating not just political but social and cultural activities as well. Not through force, but through the proliferation of increasingly non-optional civic engagements. That is the character of the totalitarian state she described. \n\nThrough that lens I would not agree that the pre-civil war period was totalitarian. The treatment of slaves was totalizing in its use of authority, but it did not principally control the social or cultural structures of slave life. There were attempts to constrain it, but not so much attempts to control the content of it and certainly not through civic engagements. Ironically a better example for you is the post-reconstruction South where the KKK and the pre-flip Democratic party did create something very much like a prototypical totalitarian state. \n\nSome colonial administrations probably were totalitarian under her actual definition, but colonialism itself is not inherently totalitarian. To be totalitarian you have to care what the people you're controlling think and be willing to invest a great deal of resources in making them think like you. Colonialism is principally a commercial endeavor with a cultural cover. Investing the resources necessary for totalitarian administration is just bad business! \n\nBoth of these examples also neglect the huge role communications technologies play in her theory. In many ways Origins of Totalitarianism is an analysis of centralized communications revolutions as much as it is political structure. \n\nI'm sorry if you don't like this, but she is right that the structure of the Russian communist and German fascist movements had striking parallels. That doesn't mean they are the same and I agree she over equates the two. But Arendt's analysis is still the best source on this particular weakness in democratic structures. That includes socialist democratic structures, like those necessary to build an anarchist society. \n\nAs for her factual inaccuracies, yah she was writing most of this shit like 10 years after it happened. Obviously there are factual inaccuracies! Again, you can learn from the analysis and *gasp* learn even more by trying to figure out if the inaccuracy affects her thesis. \n\nBut the inaccuracy you suggested is actually a strength, it demonstrates how cynicism was rampant in many wings of the Nazi party, including the one with which she was most familiar through Heidegger. Her ability to demonstrate that a seemingly megalomaniacal government can actually be quite performative is the key insight for understanding how totalitarian governments function.  \n\nYah she has an anti-Africa bias. She's also clearly not pro-colonialism. I disagree with her conclusions in the Little Rock essay, but it is unquestionably a great description of the group-psychological dynamics at play in resistance to integration. Hers is the best argument against integration precisely because it is extremely sympathetic to integration's ultimate ends. \n\nArendt, unlike civil rights era Black theorists, believed that politics should be pre-cultural and so believed that integration should start in cultural institutions like marriage and civic institutions like voting and access to public spaces and public-facing businesses. She believed that education was at the intersection of too many cultural pressures and so would destroy politics' pre-cultural legitimacy. \n\nBlack theorists at the time, who I agree with more, argued that politics was a statement of culture and that it's pre-cultural aspect was a facade maintaining power. I agree with them more in part because they are right. I also disagree with Arendt's hard divide of violence and power, but no more that I disagree with conflict theories which collapse them into the same entity. They are clearly related but not synonymous (hello Foucault). Understanding that nuance is what helped build the critical legal theory movement, so perhaps hers was an argument worth making, even if it was ultimately wrong. \n\nI'm sorry that curiosity and the ability to deal with contradictory concepts makes you angry. It is, in my experience, the most joyous part of this petty endeavor we call life.",

All the reactionary movements of the interwar period and the Second World War arise directly connected to the economic crises of capitalism and the decline in profit rates where these capitalists are unable to transfer the losses to the workers who are organized, but not to the point of making a revolution in the bourgeois state. Both Hitler and Mussolini and their followers directly served the bourgeoisie as informants and gangs to repress strikes and organizations of workers who were fighting for their rights.\n\n\n\nWhen the bourgeois state can no longer maintain the illusions for the population, big capital forms an agglomeration of the most reactionary and chavinist tendencies in society to crush the workers, trade unionists and communists and abolish bourgeois democracy that is not working the way the capitalists expect, replacing it with the open terrorism of financial capital.\n\n\n\nThe bourgeois state, instead of hiding its imperialist oppression of the masses by prioritizing the colonies, brings this repression to its population at home. This already exists in the bourgeois states and I would say that the neoliberal financial state of finance capital bears more resemblance to Nazi Germany adopting its most useful elements to serve the accumulation of capital.\n\n\n\nBecause in Germany you see the prototype of the destruction of workers' pensions through privatizations, the destruction of unions with what remains as being domesticated for the bourgeoisie, an economy that depends entirely on war bonds and debt from finance capital that will serve as a prototype in the puppet countries dependent on imperialism in the Cold War and then as a model for deregulation and the neoclassical ideology of austerity economics in the future.\n\n\n\nAnti-Semitism financed by wealthy Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, industrialists, bankers, and landowners became useful in determining which reactionary anti-communist group would form to serve the interests of German capitalism, which had lost its colonies. This had the collaboration of Zionism, which saw a common interest in the other nationalists following its capitalists. However, capitalist competition excludes others and the plan to use Germany as cannon fodder against the Soviet Union failed among British capitalists.\n\n\n\nAnother mistake made by Hannah Arendt is that capitalism disciplines its workers to increase productivity and extract profit more efficiently for the capitalist. For workers to take over, they develop discipline through class struggle, fighting for their rights together in an organized manner. The socialist state disciplines and educates workers so that they can organize in popular councils and at work to have independence in acting collectively since employment becomes a guaranteed right and there is no longer profit, but until there is production in abundance there will be discipline in receiving according to work and needs, as Marx explains in the Critique of the Gotha Program.\n\n\n\nFascism is an inevitable byproduct of capitalist society decomposing in crisis and any violence that the working classes do against capitalists and landowners will be valid without exception for their liberation and the abolition of private property. Counterrevolutionaries deserve only suppression until the extinction of the capitalist class and even then there is the question of the international revolutionary war against imperialists who maintain dominance through the export of capital in the colonies. Complete communism requires a global socialist hegemony and therefore the dictatorship of the proletariat will be maintained in one country.\n\n\n\nAll movements of workers to create and maintain economic, food, technological and other sovereignty to plan the economy and use violence against the oppressor classes and their lackeys have received my unqualified support in solidarity. I do not tolerate petty bourgeoisie competing in the market just as Marx does not tolerate them, any excuse for not using force and feeling sorry for petty bourgeoisie will not receive any sympathy from me because the proletariat is the revolutionary class that the other working classes must act together with what they have in common.",

My primary interest is understanding the psychology of society, in large part so that I can understand and share the vulnerabilities of movements which glory in suppressing others. That includes this god forsaken government under which I live, and yah, it includes you bub.\n\nYou deny the connection between German fascist social organization and Soviet social organization yet you revel in your ability to root out and suppress the capitalists and the counter-revolutionaries. Vague, amorphous groups identified as the source of all problems connected to a call for protection by a unified and hegemonic party. Hmmm that sounds familiar. \n\nYour only defense to the claim that your organization is similar is that you think you're right. And yah, you are a little more right, but neither Marx nor his progeny can tell me everything under the sun. They can't explain the psychology of bias to me. Pathetic attempts to claim it's some manipulation of capital are so disrespectful to the very idea of culture that it makes my skin crawl. \n\nThere is a connection between capitalism and fascism, no doubt. But it's not as simple as \"capitalism is failing so we make people mad at each other to cover.\" No human organization has ever had that much influence over their people, except totalitarian ones. The rise of both fascism and communism is a dance, leaders poking bold ideas into the public conscious, the public responding with varying vigor. There is some wonderful and dangerous social chemistry happening there and Arendt's account of it is among the most incisive and useful analyses of it published TO THIS DAY!\n\nCulture isn't just levers you can pull and the fact that you think you're justified in pulling them in bloody violence is why Arendt was willing to compare your ideological idols to the most despicable government ever devised. Perhaps you should turn some of your anger inward and work out why domination so appeals to you.",

I do not value the lies that you regurgitate and you will be punished along with the counterrevolutionaries who think the state is a neutral entity. Unlike you, I recognize that history changes with the advancement of the means of production and the peoples of the world only acquire true peace by abolishing private property and the capitalist class that has become common workers, unlike the outrage of liberals like you and fascists who fantasize about a false abstract past that never existed.\n\nWorkers have the right to rebel against capitalists, peasants against landlordism for their collective class interests instead of the false morality that exists only to keep the ruling class in power.\n\nFascists want to protect the capitalist state and private property by inventing fantasies to purify capitalism contaminated by the \"inferior\" and exonerating capitalism and its myth of meritocracy. Hannah Arendt is just a cold war apologist who serves as a lackey of imperialism along with the reactionaries she pretends not to be.\n\nCommunists have an interest in abolishing the entire current society and we do not need any permission from liberals like you.

Therefore, through a sleight of hand, she excuses the great crimes of imperialism \\[which would perfectly fit, through Arendt's analysis btw, in every possible measure\\], by invoking the great crimes committed by Europeans. Also, if people read her work, the 'origins of totalitarianism', you can see this orientalist categorization, being made, in far direct terms as well:\n\n>The chances for totalitarian rule are frighteningly good in lands of traditional orientalist despotism, in India and China, where there is inexhaustible material to feed the power accumulating and man destroying machinery of total domination, and where, moreover the mass man's feelings of superfluousness -- a new phenomenon in Europe. (Arendt, 'origins of totalitarianism', p.311)\n\nBasically these people are pre-disposed to these totalitarian structures, in a far higher efficacy then in Europe, which only has seen such structures as a relatively, new and artificial phenonmenon. I guess, her only, slightly re-deeming feature (and that is me using a really broad, and forgiving term), is with her nominally denouncing, Zionist settler colonialism, and aggression, and basically calling out the cabal mentality within Zionists, who frame it as, us (the eternally persecuted Jews, who are innately special), vs them (the anti-semitic barbarians, a anti-semitic, anti-Jewish cabal, who wants to repeat another holocaust)\n\n>the cynical and deep-rooted conviction that all gentiles are antisemitic, and everybody and everything is against the Jews, that, in the words\u00a0of\u00a0Herzl, the world can be divided into\u00a0*verschamte und unverschamte Antisemiten,*\u00a0and that the \"essential meaning\u00a0of\u00a0Zionism is the revolt of the Jews against their pointless and hapless\u00a0mission-\u00a0which has been to challenge the Gentiles to be crueler than they dare without forcing them to be as kind as they ought, \\[with the result that the Zionist revolt has ended in reproducing\\] in altered perspective the dynamic picture\u00a0of\u00a0Israel's mission\" (Benjamin Halpern in the\u00a0*New Leader,*\u00a0December 1947). In other words, general gentile hostility, a phenomenon that Herzl thought was directed only at Galuth Jewry, and which would therefore disappear with the normalization of the Jewish people in Palestine, is now assumed by Zionists to be an unalterable, eternal fact\u00a0of\u00a0Jewish history that repeats itself under any circumstances, even in Palestine. **Obviously this attitude is plain racist chauvinism and it is equally obvious that this division between Jews and all other peoples-who are to be classed as enemies-does not differ from other master-race theories** (even though the Jewish \"master race\" is pledged not to conquest but to suicide by its protagonists).\u00a0It\u00a0is also plain that any interpretation of politics oriented according to such \"principles\" is hopelessly out of touch with the realities of this world. Nevertheless it is a fact that such attitudes tacitly or explicitly permeate the general atmosphere\u00a0of\u00a0Jewry; and therefore Jewish leaders can threaten mass suicide to the applause of their audiences, and the terrible and irresponsible\"or else we shall go down\" creeps into all official Jewish statements, however radical or moderate their sources. (Arendt,'the Jewish writings',p.393)\n\nArendt, also to her credit, does mention, albeit scantly regarding the Zionist relationship with the Arab populations, with the Revisionists being too chauvinist, and the Socialist Zionist being too naive to note, that there does indeed exist a Arab population in Palestine. For a more in-depth view, of how Arendt viewed Zionism, read her article titled, 'Zionism reconsidered', here: [https://hakg.uzi.uni-halle.de/editions/2?lang=de](https://hakg.uzi.uni-halle.de/editions/2?lang=de) and also her article titled, 'to save a Jewish homeland'.",
