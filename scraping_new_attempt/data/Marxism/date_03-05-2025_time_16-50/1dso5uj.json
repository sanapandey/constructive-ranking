    "selftext": "Roma (Indian origin) are Europe\u2019s largest racial minority.                                                                    They have been through 500 years of Chattel Slavery in Wallachia and Moldavia (current day Romania) untill slavery was abolished in 1856. Roma were owned by the state, the boyars and the Orthodox Church.                                                    This history of Eastern European Chattel Slavery predates Western European colonialism in Africa and the Americas, first documented attestation of Roma in the Romanian space being made in 1385, when Dan I of Wallachia donates 40 g*psy families to the Tismana Monastery.\n\nTo this day, Roma haven\u2019t received any compensations, the history is still suppressed, not taught in schools, not acknowledged publicly by the former slave owners, even though this is the longest period of Chattel Slavery based on ethnicity to ever be documented worldwide.\n\nRoma have also been targeted for the Final Solution in the Holocaust next to Jewish people, but Roma are rarely mentioned. Romania has too deported them to Transnistria during WW2.\nUnlike Jewish victims, Roma received no reparations.\n\nRoma are treated as subhuman and they experience systemic opression all over Europe. In Romania, they are still segregated at the margins in the villages where their ancestors were slaves, with no access to drinking water nor infrastructure.They also experience environmental racism and are being frequently evacuated and forced to live near landfills such as the one in Pata R\u00e2t, Cluj. \n\nThese are centuries upon centuries of endless dehumanizing and despicable opression that Roma have faced, and still, they have little to no solidarity and are excluded and left out from most global discussions and movements. \n\nWe need to familiarize ourselves with the  Roma struggle. There is no liberation without the liberation of the most silenced and subjugated of us. Everything is interconnected. \n",

            "body": "This is only a partial reply, but I think there\u2019s a strong case for understanding the oppression of Romani/Sinti/Traveller lifeways across Europe as a product of historical processes of primitive accumulation. As we know from Marx the criminalization of \u201cvagrancy\u201d and \u201csquatting\u201d have long been used to force the working class into \u201cproductive\u201d labor, something that Roma communities have resisted (at times at great cost) for centuries.",

My language might sound crass, but from the perspective of any state, it is not good to have a portion of the population that is sequestered from others. Similar to how Jews were limited to certain occupations and prevented from mingling, so were and are Roma through softer means.\n\nA Marxists state would still seek to properly socialize and integrate the Roma into society. This process would involve a recognition of the Roma identity, and would seek to give to the working Roma what all working peoples are entitled to. I believe whats good for the working Europeans will be in the best interests of the Roma",
