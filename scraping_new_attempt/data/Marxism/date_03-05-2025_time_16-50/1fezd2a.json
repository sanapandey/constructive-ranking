    "selftext": ">**First, the price of the commodities varies inversely as the value of the money, and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies directly as the price of the commodities.** Exactly the same thing would happen if, for instance, instead of the value of gold falling, gold were replaced by silver as the measure of value, or if, instead of the value of silver rising, gold were to thrust silver out from being the measure of value. In the one case, more silver would be current than gold was before; in the other case, less gold would be current than silver was before. In each case the value of the material of money, i.e., the value of the commodity that serves as the measure of value, would have undergone a change, and therefore so, too, would the prices of commodities which express their values in money, and so, too, would the quantity of money current whose function it is to realise those prices.\n\nWhy does he make the quantity of money dependant on the price of commodities, when it's the other way around? Commodity prices aren't determined by the labour power required to produce money (which is an inaccessible info to sellers), but by the *quantity* of money chasing their commodities. If the value of money falls, eg. by becoming easier to produce, then the mechanism by which this finds reflection in commodity prices is by its larger quantity, as a result of its easier production.\n\n>A one-sided observation of the results that followed upon the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver, led some economists in the 17th, and particularly in the 18th century, to the false conclusion, that the prices of commodities had gone up in consequence of the increased quantity of gold and silver serving as means of circulation.\n\nIs he denying inflation here? Obviously not, and I'm simply misunderstanding. But how? An increase in the money supply will, ceteris paribus, raise the prices of commodities. Or is he criticizing those economists for ignoring that the ceteris paribus won't always hold, ie. that not all increases in the money supply cause inflation, because sometimes the amount of commodities grows proportionally, meaning their prices won't change? Is that what these economists failed to consider?",

Commodity prices aren\u2019t determined by the ~~labour power-~~ [labour] required to produce money (which is an inaccessible info to sellers), but by the *quantity* of money chasing their commodities. \n\nYou must consider the full theoretical and material  context in which this is written. Marx at this point is considering commodities that always exchange at their values (value magnitude = exchange-value and therefore = price). Just prior to these passages he does introduce the deviation of price from value magnitude (or more broadly exchange-value from value magnitude, which brings in money which by definition inherently has no price, but does have exchange-value). However the value magnitude  of the money commodity still remains relevant.\n\nPlus Marx is a dialectical thinker. He does not think only quantity of money determines the general price level. Rather the value of commodities that need circulating (the sum of all values) determines the quantity of money to circulate them. This is accomplished not only in new precious metal discovery labor, but also in drawing on hoarded of precious metals\u2014even converting gold or silver candle sticks into money, for example. The quantity of money adjusts to the value (and prices) of commodities that need to circulate because the sellers have a preconceived idea of what price their commodities should fetch (even as the quantity of their commodities circulating rises or falls dramatically). With dialectical materialism, there is no root cause (quantity of money determines prices) but rather all these parameters overdetermine each other (prices determine also the quantity of money that circulates). This is especially true when money is precious metals, as it had been up to the writing of _Capital_ (in some sense up until the 1970s). The value of gold then remains a powerful overdeterminant in the overall price and the quantity of money that circulates (the central bank does not decide how much gold to sequester in the Earth, the labor needed expended to find it and extract it, nor how easy to find it. Only as exchange-value becomes divorced from value magnitude does this value of precious metal determinant fade into obscurity.\n\n> Is he denying inflation here? Obviously not, and I\u2019m simply misunderstanding. But how? \n\nHe is merely adding in the concept that the value magnitude of the money commodity\u2014as well as the relative sum of value magnitude of all commodities that circulate\u2014overdetermines the quantity of money circulating. With the separation of money from precious metals (as money ceases to have any value magnitude, and use-value _only_ as money\u2014pure exchange-value then) obviously that absent value magnitude means the parameter is no longer relevant (or relevant only in its complete absence from the equation). \n\n> An increase in the money supply will, ceteris paribus, raise the prices of commodities. Or is he criticizing those economists for ignoring that the ceteris paribus won\u2019t always hold, ie. that not all increases in the money supply cause inflation, because sometimes the amount of commodities grows proportionally, meaning their prices won\u2019t change? Is that what these economists failed to consider?\n\nThat might be part of it. However, also that the quantity of money circulating is endogenous: it can respond to the needs of circulation, as in the total quantity of commodities that require circulating and their value magnitudes. \n\nMoney is both measure of value and standard of price. So long as money is a precious metal its value magnitude enters into the formulation of both the standard of price and the measure of value. When money becomes pure exchange-value (as with a bookkeeping balance in the money and payment system) then obviously the value magnitude of money no longer changes (always zero) and so such changes (is absent) can no longer affect prices, exchange-values, the quantity of money in circulation, and so forth. The quantity of money alone will determine then the standard of price and the measure of value for all ordinary commodities. However, it is not even then, a rote, mechanical, and one-way determination (this one-sided way of thinking about money is typical of Milton Friedman and his monetarism). Rather the quantity of ordinary commodities circulating, their prices, and so forth, can also shake the quantity of money in circulation (what with fractional reserve money, money innovations, and the use of other value tokens as money).\n\nWith money as pure exchange-value (no value whatsoever and no use-value other than as money), the tokens of value also become more developed (such as fictitious capital, negotiable/alienable agreements, joint stock shares, derivatives, even actual commodity-values like gold bullion treated as a mere token of value). With that, money participate in two separate realms circulating both commodity-values destined for consumption but also circulating these tokens of value that either expire or themselves continue to circulate just like the money commodity does.\n\nConsider the Fisher equation of exchange:\n\nMV = *P\u2022T*,\n\nWhere:\n\nM =: money supply (a scaler)\n\nV =: velocity of money (a scaler)\n\n**P** =: a vector of prices for all transactions within a given period\n\n**Q** =: a vector of quantities in all transactions within a given period\n\n\nWe can therefore modify the Fisher equation of exchange:\n\nM = (**P\u2022Q**)\u2081 \u00f7 V\u2081 +  (**P\u2022Q**)\u2082 \u00f7 V\u2082 \n\nThe indices 1 and 2 indicate respectively 1) the circulation of commodities destined for proximate consumption and 2) value tokens and quasi-tokens (such as bullion and other spot \u201ccommodities\u201d on exchanges). The velocity is divided into two components: 1) the velocity of money to commodities commodity values and 2) the velocity of money to circulate tokens of value (this will be a much greater value because financial exchange institutions merely use money to clear the markets at the end of day and not the multitudes of transactions throughout the day). \n\nAs Marx describes the melting down of gold and silver trinkets to adjust the money, endogenously, to the needs do circulation and the psychological expectations of the participants in circulating as to prices, these modern day financial markets (in index 2) allow money to flow into and out of commodity-value circulation (index 1) to keep the prices stable even as the demand for money changes drastically.",

The value of a commodity isn't determined by concrete labor, so for example the specific labor of a baker. In the market all labor gets reduced into abstract, simple labor and this is not something that comes out of anyone's will. You can't even recreate the process with math, or at least, it hasn't been solved yet. Keep reading Capital, Marx talks about this specific point.\n\nMarx distinguishes value from market price. Commodities do not get sold by their value because of the constant effect of offer and demand. Price shifts away from value but it generally orbits around it. \nThe transformation problem, the issue with converting value to price is unsolved to this day though, and its one of the reasons economics shifted away from the LTV.",
