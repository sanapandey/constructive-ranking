If we had we used military force to support our newly freed proletariat and keep the promises made to them, imagine how different this country would be today.\n\nWe could have avoided the apartheid of Jim Crow. We could have had an early 20th century black president. We could have bucked off an entire system of ultranationalist capitalism built on a foundation of slavery.\n\nObviously Special Field Order No. 15 was not a Marxist policy in the strict sense. It was very limited in scope and context. It wasn\u2019t part of a broader ideological movement to transform the economic system. \n\nBut the parallels to Lenin\u2019s 1917 Decree on Land are hard to ignore. Both policies reflect a recognition of the importance of land ownership in achieving economic justice and empowerment for oppressed groups.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read or respond to my counterfactual shower thoughts.",

Let's say all the racist insurrections only led to calls to ensure all freedman had a rifle in their home and the training to use it, forming militias. Let's say all planters land and assets were expropriated of their land and assets, with titles transferring to their former chattel. Let's say their former chattel were allowed to decide their former master's fate and the fate of his family. Leave aside the question of how the freedmen dealt with their newly acquired wealth (no doubt some would divide the land into parcels, others hold it collectively). Let's just say they remained fully enfranchised and fully possessed in the land beneath their feet and the tools in their hands.\n\nI don't think either American nationalism or capitalism would have been prevented. It would just have taken on a different form. A world without Jim Crow would not necessarily be free of other injustices. What I anticipate is that the Black population would have fully benefited from westward expansion, as much as whites did at the time. They would have been full participants in Manifest Destiny, only this time as equal players than marginal participants. The racialized social order would have been different. But there still would have been a racialized social order. To be sure, many good things would follow: I suspect the Black civil rights struggle would have occurred between 1880 and the 1930's instead of being delayed to the 1960's. I anticipate, in this timeline, antiblackness would already be dying by the 1960's. However, being full participants in Manifest Destiny would have meant that the settler would just as likely have a Black face as a white one. Anti-Chinese xenophobia and Yellow Peril still would stalk the land, and I imagine migrants from south of Texas would still be exploited and marginalized. Immigrants from Europe still catch hell in this timeline.\n\nThe main difference is that the United States would have been a Black and white nation instead of merely a white one. But this unity of Black and white would have defined itself against the red, yellow, and brown. The 1960's would have been more defined by the American Indian Movement than by the Black civil rights struggle and Black Power, imo.",

Ideologically American capitalism was dedicated to sovereignty of the people, equality before the law and free labor but only the ***pursuit*** of happiness.  \n\nDon't we need to ask why Reconstruction came to an end in 1877? Wasn't it because the emergent threat from the industrial working class could no longer be ignored so the northern capitalists sought a compromise with the former slavocracy?  Even if the \"forty acres and a mule\" promise had been kept, the logic and dynamism would have still resulted in growing class conflict.  (\n\nThe contradiction between the principles American revolutions and the prerogatives of capitalism could never be resolved and we are now witnessing that incompatibility meaning those principles are being renounced and revoked by the same class that once fought for them. \n\n\\--\n\nI had only known of the order in passing but it is worth reading about. I found the following\n\n**SPECIAL ORDER 15**\n\nSpecial Order 15 was made on 16 January 1865, three months before the end of the war. While it certainly conformed to the increasing radicalism of the Republican, something that had developed throughout the conflict, there were military prerogatives as well.\n\n>... Sherman\u2019s radical plan for land redistribution in the South was actually a practical response to several issues. Although Sherman had never been a racial egalitarian, his land-redistribution order served the military purpose of punishing Confederate planters along the\u00a0[rice](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/rice/)\u00a0coast of the South for their role in starting the Civil War, while simultaneously solving what he and Radical Republicans viewed as a major new American problem: what to do with a new class of free Southern laborers. Congressional leaders convinced President Lincoln to establish the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands on March 3, 1865, shortly after Sherman issued his order. The\u00a0[Freedmen\u2019s Bureau](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/freedmens-bureau/), as it came to be called, was authorized to give legal title for forty-acre plots of land to freedmen and white Southern\u00a0[Unionists](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/unionists/).  \n  \nThe immediate effect of Sherman\u2019s order provided for the settlement of roughly 40,000 Black Americans (both refugees and locals who had been under Union army administration in the Sea Islands since 1861). This lifted the burden of supporting the freedpeople from Sherman\u2019s army as it turned north into South Carolina.\u00a0But the order was a short-lived promise for Blacks. Despite the objections of General Oliver O. Howard, the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau chief, U.S. president Andrew Johnson overturned Sherman\u2019s directive in the fall of 1865, after the war had ended, and returned most of the land along the South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida coasts to the planters who had originally owned it.  \n...  \n[Sherman's Field Order No. 15 - New Georgia Encyclopedia](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/shermans-field-order-no-15/)\n\n  \nFWIW:\n\n>**Circular #13**  \n... At its peak in 1865, the Freedmen's Bureau controlled 800,000\u2013900,000 acres of plantation lands previously belonging to slave owners.\u00a0This area represented 0.2% of land in the South; ultimately the Johnson proclamation required the Bureau to re-allocate most of it to its former owners.   \n[Forty acres and a mule - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_acres_and_a_mule#Circular_#13)\n\nHere is [Sherman's Field Order No 15 (1865)](https://sharetngov.tnsosfiles.com/tsla/exhibits/aale/pdfs2/1865%20Sherman%27s%20Field%20Order%20No%2015.pdf)",

If the land had been redistributed, it still would have been vulnerable to white insurrections. As we saw in the years of and after Reconstruction, riots were happening routinely to arrest the policies and really what led to Jim Crow was not only the abdication by Johnson but the prevalence of violence to restore the old order. Troops posted in the South didn't want to be there any more than Southerners wanted them there so there was a lot of tension on the ground. Had the occupation of the South been extended, it likely would've cost many northern Republicans their seats in Congress and locally. The proletarian allegiances between the new workers emerging out of the South were also fragile as many low wage whites (and many free Northern black people) saw the emancipated as competition and wealthier classes were only too happy to pit them against one another. So unfortunately we can't say that singular event would've been transformative. It might have simply delayed things. What would have been needed was more effort into a fundamental rethink of the American political and economic system after the war, but most of the effort went into restoration and what they dubiously called \"redemption.\"",
