I get being apprehensive about people you don\u2019t know, since this country has a laundry list of federal sabotage in all anti capitalist/ anti racist/ anti-patriarchal movements, but is gatekeeping the only way to stay safe? I\u2019ll say that that it\u2019s already difficult to find people you align with as it is, and I know some people have had experiences with not even just the feds, but right wing nut jobs infiltrating unions to destroy them from the inside. I\u2019m interested in hearing your in-depth perspectives and opinions on why or why not you think gatekeeping is the only way, and what alternatives if any you think there may be.",

It\u2019s not the right wing ppl who present a danger to the org, it\u2019s radlibs who pretend to be communist, sex pests who join to torment and harass women and gender minorities, settler communists who are covertly racist and ableist and others who pretend to be in line with the values of the org but are joining for purely selfish reasons. A lot of \u2018communist\u2019 orgs in the US have been dissolved or hijacked because they didn\u2019t handle sexual harassment complaints and they didn\u2019t eject liberals, if they even began from a non- liberal stance at all.",

I say in the best of the cases because there have also been many cases of people who have disappeared for their activism and who later turn up murdered.",

In my organization we have a lot of training courses about how we should keep a low profile and know when to \"show the red flag\" and when we should stay quiet.\n\n I don't want to speak bad of my comrades in the United States, not at all, but I am surprised how often people say \"I am a communist and I am in x place, is there anyone else we can meet with and discuss?\". That is something totally unthinkable here and we also always prefer face-to-face dealings to talking on social networks.Maybe it's too much paranoia, but there are actually many reasons for us to behave that way. (If you are interested in knowing more, you can look up a very dark period  in the history of Mexico called \"La guerra sucia\").",

However some groups are over policed because they are in a unique position to see the US for what it is, one of those groups being undocumented migrants for example. \n\nThe state of organizing and communist action is probably more escalated in Mexico and taken more seriously by the state and bourgeoisie. Part of what the radical liberal diversion requires is that the class contradiction will not be fully apparent to most people, and Mexico is past that point where most people are acutely aware of how they are being exploited and aren\u2019t receiving the benefits and concessions which would make them generally ignore their exploitation.",

They often did illegal acts that forced them underground, which led to increased centralisation, less democracy in the organisations and limits to recruitment, paired with mistrust in fellow comrades.
