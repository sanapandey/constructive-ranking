We have, for millennia, honed the recipe of servility, with a dish of sweet morphine of\u2002delusion, a dash of fear and a sprinkle of the God of the Gaps. This brew has\u2002fathered empires, razed cultures, shackled billions with the unseen bonds of belief.\n\nAnd the first ingredient, subservience, is the\u2002bedrock. You know, before you can\u2002control a mind, you must first tame the spirit. Teach them to kneel before the unseen; shatter their sense of birthright so they feel justified in their\u2002place in the world. Submission becomes as much second nature as it is - if wrapped in the robes of\u2002virtue. It\u2002is sin to question; to obey is salvation. So\u2002does the shepherd to the sheep.\n\nNext up is morphine \u2014 not the drug, but the\u2002metaphorical sort. The opiate of\u2002hope, of promised paradise. Promise the tormented multitudes of eternal ecstasy if\u2002only they remain silent and docile. Pain does not matter\u2002much when seen as part of cosmic justice. That morphine induces but at the same time represses depression, seemingly blunting the pain of exploitation and preserving the power\u2002structures that feed on it.\n\nBut\u2002delusion is the spice that makes this brew so irresistible. The tales have\u2002to be epic, the myths larger than life. Gods who live on mountains, prophets who split seas, holy beings who have a profound interest\u2002in the day-to-day details of human existence. The more outrageous the story, the stronger\u2002the hold. Delusion makes\u2002the mundane sacred, the ordinary divine.\n\nAnd last but not least, the\u2002pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the God of the Gaps. Herein lies\u2002the genius of the recipe. Every\u2002unanswerable question, every mystery, every space of the unknown becomes evidence of the divine. Why does the thunder roar? Why does the sun rise? Why does the child die? God of the Gaps fills these gaps, shrinking\u2002with each scientific discovery but holding fast to the darkness still out there.\n\nCombine these edibles\u2002with caution. Serve too much Subjugation, and the brew sours; serve too little morphine,\u2002and the crowd disbands. Delusion needs to be skillfully crafted, and the God of the Gaps needs to keep\u2002pace with the times.\n\nThis is the recipe of\u2002rulers, of priests, of kings. It is the formula that prescribed a course of human history, writing humanity into an awkward path\u2002of obedience and fear. But every recipe contains its fault, every\u2002concoction an antidote. To unbind the mind is to take apart\u2002the recipe \u2014 ingredient by ingredient.\n\n- By Mark Augmund\n\nSource r/AnarchoDespotism \n",
