    "selftext": "Hello. I'm reading my first books and I'm at Engels' Origin of the family, property and the State. \n\nSo E is describing the iroquois society, the absence of slavery, mass trade, subjugation of fellow Nations. And I think this is credited on the Americas lack of pack animals and crop products. Without oxen to level fields to plant with wheat, native americans had to build an egalitarian, solidarity-based society to level just patches of land to plant maize by hand. Without mighty rivers like the Eufrates to irrigate said fields, no excess production could be raised to trade and begin the accumulation of wealth that culminates on slavery, misogyny and private property.\n\nBut\n\nTwo ideas pop into my head:\n\n* this sounds like the myth of the good indian, which is the romantic (that is, belonging to Rousseau's Romanticism movement) notion that civilization corrupted the pure and idyllic native americans Disney's Pocahontas-like lifestyle of diving into waterfalls and listening to the wind. Native americans did have wars among themselves and were greedy just like any other human group. \n* there were slaves in the precolumbian Americas. But maybe not among the iroquois, but the mexicas of Mesoamerica.\n\nThen it hit me: this book is from 1884. Maybe by E's time knowledge about the ancient mexicas (aztecs) was not as readily available as today.  \n\nTho I'm no expert in mexica history, as far as I understand there were plenty of city-states in Mesoamerica. Three of them, Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Texcoco and Tlacop\u00e1n joined together to squash their neighbors. They demanded hostages and human tributes as slaves and as human sacrifices. The notion that the native americans lacked cattle and compensated the missing protein with cannibalism through human sacrifice has been around, with no conclusive agreement but it does explain their fixation with heart ripping. Also, the wonderous Venice-like floating city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n that was on the process of desalination of an entire lagoon to make their artificially-made garden-like pads produce three or four harvests in a single year checks the \"accumulation of wealth\" box. \n\nMy point being, the mexicas do fit in E's analysis like a glove: they were the missing link between the egalitarian iroquois and the slaving old-worlders. Native americans + agricultural excedent = accumulation of wealth = warmongering for slaves = imperialism/subjugation of neighbors.\n\nAnd it goes further. When the europeans came, the mexicas' vassals turned on them. Spaniards did not conquer America: native americans conquered America. The Tlaxcala people and their own league carried the spaniards around. By the mexicas cruelty against their neighnors, their common culture unraveled in a few centuries of european influence. So, after imperialism comes societal colapse. \n\nI'm rather ignorant when it comes to the guatemalan Maya. But it seems they were egalitarian like the iroquois and that explains how both groups still exist against all odds. ",

Morgan about the Iroquois worked for his point on the origin of the family.",

It's a Confederacy of 6 Nations (Kanien'keha:ka/Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga, and Tuscarora), so each nation has unique traditions but they also share political and economic history. It might be worth checking out The Great Law of Peace, but there are lots of Haudenosaunee thinkers/scholars who have written on their ways of knowing (including economics). I always supplement any European writing about Indigenous peoples (Marxist or otherwise) with content produced by the appropriate Indigenous knowledge-holders. Glen Coulthard (Indigenous but not Haudenosaunee) has an excellent book called Red Skin, White Masks that builds on Marxist understandings of economics and colonialism by emphasizing Indigenous experience in North America/Turtle Island.",

Above all they would have spilled rivers of ink over the implications of Cahokia.",

For example, slavery was not a major mode of production anywhere in Africa before colonization- many groups there went straight from communalism to early feudalism other than obviously the influence of the European slave trade creating economies based on capturing and exporting people as slaves). It only means they had progressed into the next step and were not all still in the communal phase at the time of colonization. It *does* disagree with the generalization being made (by some, I haven't read origin of the family yet only listened to a podcast about it so idk if Engels does this) that everyone in the Americas was doing\u00a0 communalism until colonizers showed up.\u00a0",
