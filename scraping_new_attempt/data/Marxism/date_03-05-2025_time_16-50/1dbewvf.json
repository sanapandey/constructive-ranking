Nevertheless, Marxism demands from its followers to be well-read not only in political economy, but also in philosophy and, to a certain extent, in history.",

I would start with Capital by Marx and Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. These will give you a good base to understand the basic economic ideas people discuss a lot related to Capitalism.\u00a0",

Super easy to understand and reads like a 101 course. He was a true revolutionary as the leader of the communist party of the Philippines.

            "body": "I think David Harvey's 17 Contradictions book is pretty friendly to beginners who can just dedicate bites of time at a time. Also, because musician activism has high overlap with anarchism in general, Wayne Price's The Value of Radical Theory which is a short explanation of some of the common grounds anarchists have with marxist theory might be interesting for your case! \n\nAlso, the Critique of the Gotha program together with Lenin's comments on it is a short one that really brings out some of the key aspects of Capital but in a short essay format. \n\nFinally, Lenin is a pretty vivid writer that brings your heart into the table with him. For me, Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism, and his essays on the National and Colonial 'Questions' are still very relevant today.",
