    "selftext": "I'm trying to study the cultural revolution right now, but I don't know what theory is best to read. I tried looking on the Marxist internet archive's collection of Mao's works, but the only work that is obviously related to the cultural revolution is this [set of directives](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_84.htm), but I'm assuming that there's other important works that I'm missing. Also, though I'm most interested in reading Mao's stuff on the cultural revolution, I'd also be interested in works by the gang of four(whose works [marxists.org](http://marxists.org) seems to lack, so if anyone knows where to find more of their stuff, that'd be nice) as well as any critiques of the cultural revolution from a communist perspective.",

            "body": "FROM: [\u201c70 years after the Chinese Revolution: How the struggle for socialism was betrayed (WSWS, 24 October 2019)\u201d](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/10/24/lect-o24.html)\n\n\u2026 Various neo-Maoist tendencies in China today falsely seek to portray Mao as a genuine socialist and Marxist revolutionary, whose ideas were betrayed by others. Their claims rely heavily on Mao\u2019s so-called Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, which was neither great, proletarian nor revolutionary. In reality, Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution was a last desperate bid to oust his rivals, whom he branded as \u201ccapitalist roaders.\u201d Mao sought to mobilise support outside the party among student youth, and then among the lumpen proletariat and poor peasants organised in the so-called Red Guards. The reactionary character of this movement was expressed in its encouragement of peasant individualism, the denunciation of all culture and science as \u201cbourgeois\u201d and its elevation of the political doggerel in Mao\u2019s Little Red Book to the status of official state religion.\n\nThis initiative rapidly spun out of control, leading to confused and convulsive social struggles that threatened the very existence of the regime. When workers in Shanghai took Mao\u2019s edict \u201cBombard the Headquarters\u201d literally and engaged in mass strikes, forming the independent Shanghai People\u2019s Commune in 1967, Mao brought in the military to bring the turmoil under control. The hostility of the regime to the working class was expressed in its warning to Shanghai workers: \u201cAs workers, their main job is to work. Joining the Revolution is only secondary. They must therefore go back to work.\u201d\n\nIn reality, it was Mao, himself, who opened the road to capitalist restoration. Facing mounting economic and social problems and the threat of war with the Soviet Union, Beijing forged an alliance with US imperialism that laid the basis for China\u2019s integration into global capitalism. While Deng Xiaoping is credited with initiating market reforms, Mao\u2019s rapprochement with US President Richard Nixon in 1972 was the essential pre-condition for foreign investment and increased trade with the West. In foreign policy, the Maoist regime lined up with some of the most reactionary US-based dictatorships, including those of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Shah in Iran. \u2026",
