That is, if you want to learn about dialectical materialism and fundamental ideas to economics in Marxism.\nThat said, I would never recommend Origin of the Family as an introductory work. It's an important piece of writing, with Engels really establishing Marxism as science by using Anthropology to illuminate historical materialism. But it's also quite dense, and as already said, at places somewhat dated. In addition, where Marx himself always stressed the dialectical progression of history, Engels (especially post-Marx' death) contributed to what we now often call \"vulgar Marxism\", or a mechanical -determinist- conception of history.\n\nWhat I find a better introduction to historical materialism, is The German Ideology by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The important part is only the first half (ofc you can read the second if you're interested in philosophical debates in German history).\nThis is the first \"mature\" work from Marx, in which the main points from The Origin of the Family are expositioned together with ideas about ideology, law and the State that are fundamental to Marxism (and the first half is only about 70 pages long).\n\nTwo other short, but important works I would recommend are \"Value, Price and Profit\" and \"Wage, Labour, Capital\" both By Karl Marx. They concern Marxist economic basics. Both are under 40 pages.\n\nWith regards to Mao: he is an important and, of course, historically significant thinker. But you should not read Mao as an introduction to Marxism. His conception of dialectics is very specific and different from Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, V.I. Lenin, etc.",

Even the Manifesto is very dense and has many layers of understanding I feel but it is a good summary of Marxist ideas. \n\nI always tell people to start with Engels\u2019s Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. \n\nBut first you have to start with reading history. We learn history from a conservative perspective. There is another perspective that you have to understand. It\u2019s not less valid. The stories we learn erase the class struggle and the voices of the oppressed. And you have to understand these if you want to understand Marx. I would start with Howard Zinn\u2019s People\u2019s History of the United States. And A History of America in Ten Strikes by Eric Loomis. And a Brief History of Neoliberalism by David Harvey. \n\nLenin\u2019s State and Revolution is also a good early read. He also has a little pamphlet called the three sources and component parts of Marxism which is a very short and simple summary of Marxist concepts.  \n\nReally you should be starting with Hegel. The dialectics and references to Hegel are key to understanding Marx, especially early Marx.\n\nSpeaking of early Marx, the part on Alienation called Estranged Labour is from the 1844 manuscripts is also a good introductory read.\n\nLooking into Frankfurt school and Althusser in particular for me is worth it. But actually read them or actual secondary sources not Jordan Peterson.\n\nIf you want actual news from a Marxist/communist perspective I would recommend reading People\u2019s World. It is a small paper but it\u2019s written for laypeople and it\u2019s just the news. It gives you some perspective as to what are the stories and voices that matter to the left and working class folks.",

Different Marxist traditions have their own similar texts.\n\nFor me personally reading the [two souls of socialism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1966/twosouls/index.htm) was foundational to me because I read this shortly after the collapse of the USSR.

Most people aren't recommending Das Kapital, probably because most people haven't read it. And to be sure, it's a very, very hard book to read. But if you want to understand Marxism (and understand what capitalism actually is) there's really no substitute for it. It's the most cited book in the social sciences for a reason, because basically all political economy and sociology that has been done since is a footnote to Marx, and Das Kapital in particular. \n\nDon't expect it to be an easy read though. Expect to struggle with it a bit. Im guessing from reading your post that is something you'll be up to though. I would recommend finding a group to read it with, or using something like David Harvey's video series while you read it.

Scientific socialism is essentially putting scientific sociological theory to test, where the test bench is history and society. Before this, I was an anarchist, and the work that got me into Anarchism was Mikhail Bakunin's \"[The Capitalist System](https://youtu.be/GDI0WP-f70g)\".\n\nGood luck in your studies, I'm glad to hear that you're partaking in studies outside of your normal domain of focus; I likewise find that several right-wing authors have very insightful analyses that inform my overall worldview as a communist.\n\nI'd recommend the late Michael Sugrue's and Darren Staloff's lectures on Hegel and Marx as a great introduction, available for free on YouTube: [[1](https://youtu.be/0F8REGux8qs)], [[2](https://youtu.be/_xbZzxet9Cs)], [[3](https://youtu.be/AujF0bbiP_8)], [[4](https://youtu.be/zDY5vuMW90s)], [[5](https://youtu.be/5VAs32jOsGs)]. Also worth looking into the [Frankfurt School](https://youtu.be/xX9EI8wEyuY), which heavily developed Marxist theory in the early to mid 20th century, and was heavily involved in university student radicalism in the 1960s. [This dialogue](https://youtu.be/U23Ho0m_Sv0) between Bryan Magee and Herbert Marcuse is a great start, also Bryan Mage's dialogues about [Hegel](https://youtu.be/iQeS6EH8bPw) and [Marx](https://youtu.be/G5v6U1SJdtU).\n\nIt's also worth looking into the history of various socialist experiments. Here's a few documentaries: [Soviet Russia Through the Eyes of an American](https://youtu.be/Pk2DJTAmwJ8), [Tsar to Lenin](https://archive.org/details/tsar-to-lenin-color), [How Yukong Moved the Mountains](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3fsZgrmuTzdfPnyHdHL6YqPxcMSw2IfY), [USSR: A Society Without Crisis](https://youtu.be/_Ib4vM42fVo), [Socialist Albania](https://youtu.be/V_nlWEIWOJA), [Mission to Moscow](https://archive.org/details/missiontomoscow1943).\n\n[Bonus video](https://youtu.be/-e8rt8RGjCM)",

Who don't want their kids to succeed? \n\nMany liberals tend to be what I'd call Small Business Capitalists who struggle with regulations and a playing field skewed toward laws engineered by both right and left wing Big Capital.\n\nI've worked with high integrity folks and low integrity folks on both sides of the aisle and deep experience with what ruins people on both sides:\n\nA grudge or grievance that says life isn't being fair to them *personally* \n\nA sense that lying, cheating and manipulation are *normal* and *required* and further justified because they are a (Christian or Social Justice) Warrior who is holier than thou! \n\nThat said? Read Marx. I'm not a Believer but I still read parts the Bible over again, have studied many other religions. \n\nI'm an oddball. I screwed up my integrity when I was younger, had an affair and lost the faith of my close peeps. I've fought hard since then to maintain my Word of Honor.\n\nOh, and if you hear someone on the news use the words or phrases free market, level playing field, invisible hand, etc? They are bullshit. \n\nYou can discuss policy without always bringing up ideology. \n\nIdeology is either inflexible, used as a blunt weapon or constantly changed to mean anything the weak-assed bully wants it to mean. \n\nI'm a Rural Liberal, fairly conservative financially, euthanized a deer with a fishing knife to the throat earlier this year after it was hit by a car, want balance in environmental laws for small farmers and adore my conservative neighbors. \n\nAnd, oddly? I'm my extended family tree, it has been those who felt butthurt who turned conservative, lived off someone else's money or shouted capitalism except when they were losing a business money and suddenly decided our family business was a charitable institution \"with no responsibility to the shareholders\" at a board meeting. Our accountant had a canary. \"You can't stay that!\"\n\nConservatism has some very good values. I just wish conservative politicians had spines and values .\n\nOh and the Democratic party is a herd of cats who could be in a locked room with a mouse and starve to death fighting over how to best divide it. Worst communicators ever. Nora Ephron in her top painful eternal truths listed \"the Democratic party will always be deeply disappointing!\"\n\nSo, skim Marx but realize no liberal of any sense \"hates capitalism\" or hates America, etc. Ugh \n\nAnd you sound like someone I'd love to chat with and learn from!",

            "body": "One of the other problems with just reading Marx is that conservative media has staged certain movements, like intersectionality, CRT, DEI, political correctness, and even globalism and corporate design as Marxist or crypto-Marxist movements, when really they are mostly the results of liberal navel-gazing or intervention by The Soviets. I don\u2019t know of any books that tackle these ideas from a Marxist perspective, but I think it\u2019s extremely important to decouple them from Marxism to understand where Marxism fits in. I\u2019ve recommended Capital to conservatives, but they tend to get really bored by the lack of direct political engagement. Any book that touches on today\u2019s political landscape from a Marxist perspective can be really useful to a curious conservative but unfortunately I don\u2019t know any. Definitely ask plenty of questions, and Marxists can clear up incorrect information.",

Because of this, it's helpful to either read things from both early and late in his career to see the difference or to rely on secondary literature. \n\nFor the former, I suggest reading Marx's Poverty of Philosophy, The Communist Manifesto, and 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. Oh and Engels's Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. \n\nFor the latter, I recommend Michael Heinrich's *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital* which does a good job going through the relationship between Marx and Marxism and covering Marx's ideas. Simon Clarke's *Marx, Marginalism, and Modern Sociology* does a good job comparing Marx to modern economics and sociology but is also a little dense and theoretical. *Mute Compulsion* by S\u00f8ren Mau is a good one for more modern non-soviet Marxism.",

In \"Estranged Labour\", Marx speaking of man's species-being (Gattungswessen) as labour-oriented and dependent on a constant intercourse with nature is very similar to how he talks about labour in chapter seven of Capital:\n\n>We presuppose labour in a form in which it is exclusively a human characteristic \\[...\\] Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purposes in those materials. And this a purpose he is conscious of, it determines the mode of his activity with the rigidity of a law, and he must subordinate his will to it. (284, Penguins Classic version)\n\nI think this verse subtly pokes at a deep philosophical position in that Man is an attentive labour-being, which very much complements his earlier work in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.\n\nI also disagree that anyone should ever rely on secondary literature. There is obviously merit to the countless books on Marx out there, but only once you have read the text yourself. There are vast opinions and interpretations of Marx that one must absolutely read the primary source first to develop an educated opinion on the matter.",

I'm referring to Marx's changing positions on the state, technological optimism, his return to hegel in Capital, etc. There is a cohesive development with Marx often going back to old ideas with new eyes but that development involves a lot of changes. \n\n>I also disagree that anyone should ever rely on secondary literature.\n\nI think this is a silly position I see people have. Secondary literature is fine for introducing vocabulary and key concepts in a way that'll make engaging with the original texts easier. As long as you keep in mind that the author is always going to insert their own biases into the text, it's fine. Yes, there are some real stinkers in the introductions to Marx. I happen to believe the ones I recommended were pretty good, having read them and read Marx.",
