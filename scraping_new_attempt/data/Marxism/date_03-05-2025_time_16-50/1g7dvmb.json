    "selftext": "Hi! I identify as marxist, but have some trouble with the hammer and sickle symbol, specifically because I know that USSR had some very cruel things they did and generally the hammer and sickle symbol is not viewed in a positive light in my country - Poland. My best friend who's just identifies as leftist but no specific ideology, has part of her family living in Belarus and her father travels all across europe including many eastern european countries, he met hundreds of people who first-hand described how the USSR times weren't really good and because of that, she is 100% confident that hammer and sickle shouldn't be used anymore as the symbol now is tainted with trauma of people who suffered because of Stalin. I'm unsure what to do, really, I feel a bit uneducated about USSR itself but I do know the suffering of many people was real. In my mind it's just communism being a great thing but execution of it in USSR being unfortunate. I can't really argue with my friend much about it as it's her generational trauma influencing it all. I think the hammer and sickle symbol is visually great but I just kind of wish there was a specifically marxist symbol?\n\nTldr: Is there any marxist symbol out there that's actually being used, or any alternative to the hammer and sickle one? I also welcome opinions why despite the trauma and horrible actions of the USSR, why the hammer and sickle is still valid to be used?",

            "body": "The hammer and sickle represent unity between workers and peasants, which is kind of beautiful. The Russian Revolution brought millions out of poverty and massively brought up the level of education of an entire people who were illiterate a generation before. Housing, healthcare and a basic living were a given/basic rights. I wouldn't disagree with some negative views as there were negative things, of course. This is especially true for some satellite countries. I think we need to rethink anti-Soviet ideas - not to pretend it was perfect, but to put it in a larger context and also remember the progress and the promise. And maybe there is a way to rehabilitate the hammer and sickle so the meaning goes beyond the Soviet flag?",

You say you are uniformed so i expect to shock you when i say that Stalin didn't many bad things/Misinformation , usually on topics such as the Ukraine famine of 1933, purges etc, which all have data and documents showing the truth behind it.\n\n3.Poland during its communist rule was for a majority of its time under a revisionist ussr as well as lots of internal politics , in essence its a nuanced topic that cannot just be attributed to Socialism bad...\n\nSo in all honesty it would do a disservice to neglect all the workers and soldiers who fought under the hammer and sickle for a better life from capitalism, while you want to brand it almost as a second swastika. This is not an attack on you, if you want to know more about the truth behind the so called 'Trauma' under stalin please ask. As for your friend i would suggest doing some reading or asking around and telling them that you sympathise with them but also show them how the hammer and sickle is the only force to do some of the greatest deeds to the workers most easy being defeating fascism.",

Like maybe they had not much food but at least they had jobs, while none of my friends can even get a job, including me who lost a blue collar worker job recently LITERALLY because of capitalism. I wasn't as efficient as the older workers so I wasn't \"economic\", as the boss put it, for their company, even tho they paid me below minimum wage.\n\nI know my best friend is probably just biased, as it is generational trauma, her mother refuses to use her Belarusian last name specifically because of how living in Belarus was horrendous.\n\nI'm honestly quite lost, must admit I'm genuinely afraid of questioning if Soviet russia had good things, as it's kinda the norm in Poland to think it was horrible, especially because how the Soviets sent a lot of polish people to Siberia. One thing is I honestly despise cult of personality, so that's one of my personal reasons for disliking Stalin, it's a slippery slope to idolize a person who might only pretend to care and just purely want power and attention, fueling their egoism.\n\nI am skeptical though, as I understand the existence of red scare is very real, as well as the argument that it's just nostalgia when people praise communist times is kinda... invalidating real opinions of people who might have had a better life during communist rule. \n\nI'd really appreciate if you could send me sources, preferably videos, documentaries and audiobooks, that talk about the reality of things from your perspective!

These factors and other's show that while one group (Most people that lived under the Ussr were in arguably the worst part of 80-90s, this does not represent the interests and life of people under time's. If you want to read on how the Ussr moved away from socialism the book - [https://archive.org/details/IsTheRedFlagFlying](https://archive.org/details/IsTheRedFlagFlying) (Unfortunately internet archive is currently down but if you want to buy or wait for the book go ahead) \n\n3.I will paste a lot on Poland in a reply to this but i do not want to clog up my reply with it atm.\n\n4. I mean just from your wording it seems you are under red scare information, which is fine everybody has been in this, i can see this by calling it soviet Russia as the entire point is its a federation of nationalities and countries for a common cause. I would probaly need more to understand your claim on the polish sent to siberia but now i will address the myth of stalin's cult of personality.

S. Khrushchev: Report to the Central Committee, 20th Congress of the CPSU, February 1056; London; 1956; p. 80-81).\n\nIn his \u201csecret speech\u201d to the same Congress on 25 February (leaked to the US State Department but not published within the Soviet Union) attacked Stalin more directly, asserting that\n\n\u201c\u2026 the cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods, supported the glorification of his own person.\u201d\n\n(Russian Institute, Columbia University (Ed.): \u2018The Anti-Stalin Campaign and International Communism\u2019; New York; 1956; p. 69).\n\nYet many witnesses testify to Stalin\u2019s simplicity and modesty.\n\nThe French writer\u00a0Henri Barbusse\u00a0(1873-1935) describes the simplicity of Stalin\u2019s life-style:\n\n\u201cOne goes up to the first floor, where white curtains hang over three of the windows. These three windows are Stalin\u2019s home. In the tiny hall a long military cloak hangs on a peg beneath a cap. In addition to this hall there are three bedrooms and a dining-room. The bedrooms are as simply furnished as those of a respectable, second-class hotel. . . The eldest son, Jasheka, sleeps at night in the dining room, on a divan which is converted into a bed; the younger sleeps in a tiny recess, a sort of alcove opening out of it. Each month he earns the five hundred roubles which constitute the meagre maximum salary of the officials of the Communist Party (amounting to between \u00a320 and \u00a325 in English money). . . . This frank and brilliant man is a simple man. He does not employ thirty-two secretaries, like Mr. Lloyd George; he has only one. . .\n\nStalin systematically gives credit for all progress made to Lenin, whereas the credit has been in very large measure his own.\u201d\n\n(H. Barbusse: \u2018Stalin: A New World seen through One Man\u2019; London; 1935; p. vii, viii, 291, 294).\n\nTrue, Stalin had the use of a\u00a0dacha, or country cottage, but here too his life was equally simple, as his daughter\u00a0Svetlana\u00a0relates:\n\n\u201cIt was the same with the dacha at Kuntsevo. . . .\n\nMy father lived on the ground floor. He lived in one room and made it do for everything. He slept on the sofa, made up at night as a bed.\u201d\n\n(S.

First let it be noted that, unlike Mussolini, Hitler and other modern dictators, Stalin is not invested by law with any authority over his fellow-citizens. He has not even the extensive power . . . . .which the American Constitution entrusts for four years to every successive president. . . . .Stalin is not, and never has been, . . . . the President of the USSR. . . . .He is not even a People\u2019s Commissar, or member of the Cabinet.\n\nHe is . . . the General Secretary of the Party.\n\nWe do not think that the Party is governed by the will of a single person, or that Stalin is the sort of person to claim or desire such a position. He has himself very explicitly denied any such personal dictatorship in terms which certainly accord with our own impression of the facts.\n\nThe Communist Party in the USSR has adopted for its own organisation the pattern which we have described. . . . . . In this pattern individual dictatorship has no place. Personal decisions are distrusted, and elaborately guarded against. In order to avoid the mistakes due to bias, anger, jealousy, vanity and other distempers . . . . it is desirable that the individual will should always be controlled by the necessity of gaining the assent of colleagues of equal grade, who have candidly discussed the matter and who have to make themselves jointly responsible for the decision. . . . .Stalin . . . . has . . . . frequently pointed out that he does no more than carry out the decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. . . The plain truth is that, surveying the administration of the USSR during the past decade under the alleged dictatorship of Stalin, principal decisions have manifested neither the promptitude nor the timeliness, nor yet the fearless obstinacy that have often been claimed as the merits of a dictatorship. On the contrary, the action of the Party has frequently been taken after consideration-so prolonged, and as the outcome of discussion sometimes so heated and embittered, as to bear upon their formulation the marks of hesitancy and lack of assurance. . . .These policies have borne . . . . the stigmata of committee control.\u201d\n\n(S. & B. Webb: \u2018Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation\u2019; London; p.. 4231, 432, 433, 435).\n\nPerhaps Barbusse, Hoxha and the Webbs may be considered biased witnesses. Yet observers who are highly critical of Stalin agree with the testimony of the former.\n\nThe American diplomat\u00a0Joseph Davies\u00a0(Joseph Davies, American lawyer and diplomat (1876-1958); Chairman (1915-16) and Vice-Chairman (1916-18) of Federal Trade Commission; Ambassador to Moscow (1936-38), to Belgium (1938-39) remarks on Stalin\u2019s simple, kindly manner:\n\n\u201cI was startled to see the door . . . open and Mr. Stalin come into the room alone.. . . . His demeanour is kindly, his manner almost depreciatingly simple. . . .He greeted me cordially with a smile and with great simplicity, but also with a real dignity. . . .His brown eye is exceedingly kindly and gentle.

She describes a train trip with Stalin from the Crimea to Moscow in 1948:\n\n\u201cAs we pulled in at the various stations we\u2019d go for a stroll along the platform. My father walked as far as the engine, giving greetings to the railway workers as he went. You couldn\u2019t see a single passenger. It was a special train and no one was allowed on the platform. Who ever thought such a thing up? . . . . Who had contrived all these stratagems? Not he. It was the system of which he himself was a prisoner and in which he suffered from loneliness, emptiness and lack of human companionship. . . Nowadays when I read or hear somewhere that my father used to consider himself practically a god, it amazes me that people who knew him well can even say such a thing.. . . He never thought of himself as a god.\u201d\n\n(S. Alleluyeva: \u2018Letters to a Friend\u2019; London; 1968; p. 202-03, 213).\n\nShe describes the grief of the servants at the dacha when Stalin died:\n\n\u201cThese men and women who were servants of my father loved him. In little things he wasn\u2019t hard to please. On the contrary, he was courteous, unassuming and direct with those who waited on him. . .Men, women, everyone, started crying all over again. . . .\n\nNo one was making a show of loyalty or grief. All of them had known one another for years. . . . . .\n\nNo one in this room looked on him as a god or a superman, a genius or a demon.

I am, it appears, a hero of the October Revolution, the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet, the leader of the Communist International, a legendary warrior-knight and all the rest of it. This is absurd, comrades, and quite unnecessary exaggeration. It is the sort of thing that is usually said at the graveside of a departed revolutionary.

Now onto Poland\n\nIndustrial Capacities\n\nPrior to WWII, Poland had been lagging behind the rest of Europe in terms of industrial development. To make matters worse, WWII had utterly devastated the country's cities and economic centers, leaving the economy in ruins. According to the 1948 United Nations Statistical Yearbook, Poland's industrial output in 1945 was only 48% of what it had been in 1938 (pg. 126). This reflects the damage done to the Polish economy by WWII.\n\nAfter the socialist system was in place, the economy began to grow rapidly. The 1948 UN Statistical Yearbook shows that Poland's industrial output in 1948 was already 153% of what it had been in 1938 (pg. 126). This means that industrial output grew more than 300% from 1945 to 1948 (combining post-war recovery with the introduction of the socialist system).\n\nThis growth continued for several decades. The 1978 UN Statistical Yearbook shows that industrial output in 1977 was 193% of what it had been in 1971, compared to only 44% in 1960 (pg. 181). This comes out to an almost 500% increase in industrial output between 1960 and 1977 (more than doubling between 1960 and 1970, than increasing by 93% from there). This demonstrates the immense productivity of the socialist system.\n\n[https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210453264/read](https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/books/9789210453264/read) (1948) [https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/61725?ln=en&v=pdf](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/61725?ln=en&v=pdf) (1978)",

According to the University of Bath (one of the top-ranked research universities in Great Britain):\n\nBefore World War II (WWII) Poland was one of the countries with the poorest health in Europe. In the 1930's life expectancy in Poland was around 46 years for both sexes; in the same period in Germany it was over 61 years. Infant mortality was estimated at the level of 150 deaths per 1000 live births. The situation was exacerbated by WWII; between 1939 and 1945 life expectancy in Poland fell by 20-25 years.\n\nThese statistics are verified in the 1948 UN Statistical Yearbook (pg. 58), which included data from 1931 onwards, reflecting the poor healthcare conditions in pre-communist Poland. Once the socialist system was in place, things began to improve rapidly. According to the University of Bath:\n\nThe health transformation that took place in Poland after WWII proceeded very rapidly. Control of infectious diseases and infant mortality became a state priority in the post-war Polish People\u2019s Republic... Life expectancy in Poland increased to 70 years and infant mortality decreased to 30 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nThus, we can see that life expectancy was increased by decades, and infant mortality fell by eighty percent. These changes (and similar ones in other socialist nations) led to Central and Eastern Europe nearly closing the healthcare gap with Western Europe, which had been so pronounced before socialism:\n\nThe epidemiological transition that in the United Kingdom or Germany took almost a century, in Poland, and many other Central and East European (CEE) countries, occurred in the two decades following WWII. This process led the CEE region to almost closing the health gap dividing it from Western Europe in the 1960's.\n\nOn the downside, the Polish People's Republic saw rapidly increasing consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, which led to increased rates of preventable death. This problem also occurred in other nations in the Soviet bloc:\n\n\n\nIn Poland the consumption of vodka and smoking prevalence reached some of the highest levels in Europe. This dramatic increase in exposure to lifestyle risk factors (an increase in cigarette sale from 20 billion cigarettes per annum after WWII to around 100 billion in the 1980's, and an increase of alcohol consumption from 3 liters per annum to nearly 9 liters in the same period), led Poland and the CEE region to a health catastrophe caused by the rise of chronic diseases.\n\n\n\nDespite these problems (which were not the result of socialism, but rather of excessive drinking and smoking), the healthcare achievements of the Polish People's Republic remain impressive.",

And the figures of this statistic are not only dangerous, they are terrifying.\n\n\n\nAfter the communist takeover, the educational system was drastically improved. The level of illiteracy was drastically reduced. According to the Polish Encyclopedia published by PWN (the top publisher of scientific and scholarly reference works in Poland):\n\n\n\nAs early as 1960, the census showed 645,000 total illiterates and 270,000 semi-illiterates among those over 50. In 1988, the illiteracy rate in Poland was 2%.\n\n\n\nWhile PWN places the pre-communist literacy rates a bit higher than the New Courier, we can still see the drastic improvement to the educational situation made under the communists, particularly in rural areas.",

Prior to the communist era, abortion was only legal in cases of criminal sexual activity. According to the Brown Political Review:\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, abortion was illegal under any circumstance in Poland. But in 1932, Poland enacted a code that legalized abortion in the cases of a criminal act, namely rape, incest, and underage sex. This was the first abortion law that condoned abortion in the case of a crime. The law remained on the books from 1932 until 1956.\n\nHowever, it was only in the communist era that abortion became completely legal, as well as freely available:\n\nIn 1956, the Polish Sejm (the lower house of parliament), in keeping with Communist Party orthodoxy, legalized abortions when women expressed \u201cdifficult leaving conditions\u201d. During the 60's and 70's, abortion became freely available in both public hospitals and private clinics. While the Soviet system encouraged mothers to carry the child to term, the law left it to physicians to decide whether abortion should be performed and largely guaranteed easy access to the operation.\n\nEven reactionary commentators acknowledged the gender equality of the communist era. According to the Guardian:\n\nStamped into the DNA of this society, from the postwar years until 1991, was that everyone had to work; for that, there had to be equal access to education, childcare (which was mainly attached to workplaces) and care for the elderly.\n\nEmployment for women was extremely high in the communist era, and it fell drastically afterwards:\n\nThroughout the communist years female workforce participation was incredibly high, often cited at 90%... As communism collapsed, participation fell to 68% and it now stands at 45%.\n\nOne Polish woman is quoted as saying:\n\n\"The regime made absolutely no distinction between men and women. I never even thought about the division \u2013 all advance in society was open to men and women equally.\n\n\"As far as education is concerned it was absolutely equal, to the extent that at the technical universities \u2013 the very high-standard engineering universities \u2013 I think 30% of students were women\" (this was in the 1960's \u2013 engineering courses at Imperial College London still have a male to female ratio of 5:1 today).\n\nKeep in mind that this Guardian article is written from a firmly anti-communist perspective, and even still it acknowledges that the \"end of communism in Poland hasn't helped Polish women.\" This demonstrates the improvements in women's rights made under the communists.\n\nSources used from this statements - [https://web.archive.org/web/20210111233238/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305806087\\_Health\\_in\\_the\\_Polish\\_People's\\_Republic](https://web.archive.org/web/20210111233238/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305806087_Health_in_the_Polish_People's_Republic) , \n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210301075125/http://retropress.pl/nowy-kurjer/30-procent-analfabetow/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301075125/http://retropress.pl/nowy-kurjer/30-procent-analfabetow/) , \n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210308201758/https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/analfabetyzm;3869021.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308201758/https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/analfabetyzm;3869021.html) , \n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210225163611/https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/01/reproductive-rights-in-post-communist-poland/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225163611/https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2015/01/reproductive-rights-in-post-communist-poland/) , \n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20201204190546/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/polish-women-communism-better-equality](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204190546/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/polish-women-communism-better-equality)",

And the existence of a proletarian society is defined by class war. The USSR made enormous strides in the bettering of people's lives while also resisting bourgeois reaction for decades. They saved the world from the Nazis. That doesn't mean there weren't issues and problems, but each of those deserves a fuller analysis in the context of class war. \n\nTo ignore/deny the USSR or Stalin is to deny the data in favor of the hypothesis.

I've been needing to learn more about the Black Panther Party. They were communists, but they didn't go around yelling about communism or waving the hammer and sickle. Yet they were the closest to a vanguard party the US had. Communism informed their organization and action, but they weren't shy about their communism either; educating people on Marxism and such whenever asked. \n\nSo yeah there's reasons to not go around waving the hammer and sickle.

These are seemingly contradictory. At least in this context, the way you've presented them to me feels contradictory but I'm sure there's been a disconnect in communication somewhere. \n\n>and the fact that it did massively improve the productive forces of the world.\n\nRight. But increased productive forces do not necessarily translate to improved QoL. Marx also theorized how capital inherently pushes for the proletariat to exist on as little as possible, because a lower cost of labor-power translates to higher profits. \n\n>and does inevitably worsen the conditions of the proletariat on a whole. But also their conditions are still better than under feudalism, sort of. It\u2019s complicated.\n\nI think this is largely the linchpin. We can _definitely_ agree on the \"sort of, it's complicated\" bit. I'm no longer convinced that it's accurate to say that capitalism has improved conditions for the proletariat. Although I wouldn't strictly assert the opposite. I think there's a combination of\n\n1) The changes from feudalism to capitalism are as much if not more qualitative than quantitative, so the question of \"better or worse\" is wildly complex, if not futile. Sure, we can see improvements in productive capacity, which comes with certain benefits. But we can also see a drastic increase of working days, elimination of generational knowledge and practices through colonization and witch trials, genocide, alienation of people from each other, nature, and even themselves, etc...\n\n\n2) The idea that capitalism is an improvement over feudalism depends heavily on which specific data you're considering, and usually ignores peoples outside the imperial core. It could be said that capitalism hasn't improved conditions as much as exported suffering. And the modern argument that capitalism is reducing poverty hinges solely on China. Even if we consider China as capitalist, if removing a single capitalist country changes the conclusion, then that one country is the driver of poverty reduction, not capitalism in the abstract.",

To be a Marxist is to simply seek to reveal and alleviate structural inequalities inherent to a capitalist system. The symbols associated with Marxism are by no means inherent to this mode of thinking, and I think there is utility in abandoning former communist aesthetics that many view to have a loaded history. We can easily invoke the property question and reveal contradictions in capitalist logic to peers without ever using a symbol or even proclaiming ourselves to be Marxist. We live in an era that precedes immense red scare propaganda that has instilled a rejection of projects such as the USSR. Any effort to grow Marxist thinking must then acknowledge this condition and adjust accordingly, adopting new symbols and aesthetics when needed. \n\nIf you're nonetheless still interested in a less problematic symbol, I think the red star or red flag are better options.",

How do you build socialism in a country that was historically occupied by empires to its east and its west, but which are now both socialist republics? If an empire like the Russian Empire has a revolution, how can that empire spread socialism successfully to lands it used to rule? If a modern empire like America had a revolution, what would the dynamics then be between it and countries it has historically dominated, such as the nations in Latin America?

I think saying how other nations use it too and how it's not exclusive to USSR is one argument. I also enjoyed one someone here said about how we shouldn't disregard the workers who fought to end capitalism under that symbol.\n\nPersonally I do find hammer and sickle to be extremely powerful and it would be hard to create something better.

Contrary to what some may tell you, this is not just because the wrong guy got the leadership position (not a very scientific view of history, I might add) but because of specific material conditions at the time. Without a revolution abroad the USSR was always doomed, even Lenin acknowledged this. And yes, despite what the comments say, you can discount Stalin. They will talk on and on about his victory over Hitler and while that\u2019s great, Churchill and FDR did that too and they aren\u2019t exactly great Marxists. Stalin reversed several socially progressive policies, especially around women\u2019s rights, and abandoned the international revolution with his dissolving of the Comintern and his policy of Socialism In One Country (something explicitly stated to be impossible in all previous theorizing, and proven to be impossible by the USSRs current state of non-existence and non-socialism). Do not fall into the Stalinist trap, it\u2019s a waste of time. There are many communist critiques of the USSR you can find, I suggest you look into those.",
