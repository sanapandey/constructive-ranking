    "selftext": "I'm starting to read Capital and I've only read a few books on theory so I'm no veteran here. I thought of this while reading\u2013 so Twitter was worth like $44B a couple years ago and after Elon bought it and ruined it, its now worth less than $10B so in the econ 101 explanation, the company lost so much value because he threw away the value of the Twitter as a brand and the changes he made drove away advertisers so it isn't as profitable. I could also say that the company is worth $10B because it is that valuable in a capitalist system since it generate $X in profits. In a socialized system, it'd have a lot less value because profitability isn't a valued metric, utility to society is. \nMy next thought was that in a socialized society you might not even see things like AI, luxury fashion brands or casinos because they have limited utility in a system that isn't driven by wealth accumulation, status and infinite production. Casinos especially, since the end goal of communism is eliminating money all together while meeting everyone's needs and thus there is little incentive to risk what you have. At the same time going back to my earlier thought, casinos have pretty much zero value to society. It is entertainment- but only because we, as part of the working class, have scarcity artificially imposed on us. If I think about it\u2013 the only time I get anything out of gambling is when there's a lot on the line. Blackjack isn't even that fun when you don't bet on it. Same with the lottery\u2013 theres no game, people are just donating $2 to the government because theres a 1 in 350,000,000 chance they'll never have to work again. \nAnyway, I felt like I had to type out my thoughts somewhere I know it's rambley",

Frick Frack was unique in that you bet, and won, things, not money. Some people would bet the silliest things and walk away with some really cool shit. I\u2019ve never learned how to play blackjack, so I didn\u2019t play, but I always enjoyed watching people play at Frick Frack because they almost got *more* enjoyment out of winning random shit than they would a little extra cash. \n\nPlus the dealers were always really performative and over the top with costumes and big personalities. It was a trippy time.",

It\u2019s about expression and masterfully skilled seamstresses able to transfer the design on paper to a real life garment that can be worn. \n\nA lot of fashion is about gloating you have money or belong to a higher class. And that will obviously become redundant. (No one wants to mark themselves as rich after the revolution) \n\nBut a lot of fashion is also about the visual. Goth clothes and jewelry are on par with some high end brands when it comes to prices. Yet they communicate no class belonging nor wealth. Used cosplays can sell for thousands of dollars and a complete cosplay will often be more expensive than wearing designer clothing from top to bottom. Yet people still save up and buy them, solely because they think they look good and want to wear them. \n\nIt\u2019s sort of like art. The art pricing and auction/collection culture will completely die, but people will still make art. Not for profit, but for passion.",

Maybe work like an arcade game where enough chips could be exchanged for something that is exclusive but not accumulatable (ownable).

I'd enjoy writing software even more: I'd be writing things that benefit society, exclusively, and are not gated to those who can afford the benefit. but no reason to get rid of claude.\n\nPeople love to gamble, its really deeply ingrained into us. And its more fun when playing for meaningful stakes with big risk, at least to some addicts. It would probably be very different though. There'd be no need to have casinos! I agree there - things engineered specifically to take advantage of addicts.\n\nI dont fully agree about luxury fashion brands, veblenian goods. people would still want those things, the desire for status symbol is inherent to human psychology, I believe. Such luxury goods would likely look very different, and I think the desire for such things would be greatly reduced. there's an extent to which the desire for status symbols is driven by living in a capitalist society and an extent to which its very primal, our need to compete, to show off, to gain attention, to be desirable.\n\nScarcity isn't entirely imposed by our capitalist overlords. We **do** generate more food and housing than there are hungry mouths and people to house. BUT, some degree of scarcity is genuine. There's only so much lithium, fresh water, arable land, human labor, or any number of other things on the planet.\n\nI guess I only agree with your \"first thought\", I have no real arguments to the first paragraph you wrote.

It revealed that money manifests as a tool to expropriate excess labor value, and seeks to abolish money as an accounting unit in favor of superior organization that doesn't expropriate value from the disenfranchised class to benefit the owning class.\n\nGambling represents the peak of commodity fetishism that Marx identified in Capital - where social relations between people are completely obscured and replaced by abstract relations between chances and odds. The gambler's relationship with other people becomes fully mediated through tokens and probability, reaching an extreme form of alienation that Lenin further analyzed in \"Imperialism\" as a symptom of parasitic capital.\n\nThe notion that gambling could persist without money fundamentally misunderstands Marx's materialist analysis as developed in \"The German Ideology.\" Gambling isn't a transhistorical cultural practice but a specific social phenomenon tied to capitalist relations of production. Labor without wages is still labor - Marx's analysis of primitive accumulation shows this clearly. But gambling without money becomes something qualitatively different, stripped of its essential character as a manifestation of fictitious capital and speculation.\n\n  \nNot only is it incompatible, Marxism sets out to abolish the conditions that allow gambling to exist in the first place.",
