It was a milestone in the development of modern materialist thought, whose vigorous beginnings had been the work of the French encyclopedists at the end of the seventeenth century, and which would later reach its peak in the work of Marx and in the doctrine of dialectical materialism.\n\nThe importance of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary doctrines in the field of scientific knowledge of living organised matter is undoubtedly comparable to that of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo or Newton, the founders of modern celestial mechanics, in terms of knowledge of the physical world and the stellar universe. The discoveries of these geniuses of astronomical research were to lead to hypotheses on the formation of celestial bodies and in particular the solar system. Since the days of Kant and later Laplace\u2019s famous hypothesis of the formation of the solar system from the emission of matter from the sun, cosmogonic theories have followed one another. Each one differs profoundly from the other, but what they all have in common is that they are all based on the principle of the evolution of the cosmos. Modern discoveries in astrophysics leave no room for doubt that the constellations, the stars, the planets, the earth itself, have a \u201chistory\u201d, perhaps measured in billions of years. Celestial bodies are neither fixed nor eternal: they are in perpetual motion. They are born, live and change in the vastness of space. Matter is constantly evolving. The physical world and the stellar universe that we observe are only the present stage of an undeniable evolutionary process, even if, in the present state of our knowledge, we do not yet know all the laws of its development.\n\nBefore Darwin, cosmic evolutionism was a great conquest of materialist thought, but there was a lack of a doctrine that explains in a materialist way the laws that govern the Kingdom of the Living. The universe appeared to be populated by ever-changing bodies. The nebula hypothesis formulated by Kant in 1755 and later perfected by Laplace had dispelled the creationist myth, at least within the confines of the solar system. But it seemed unassailable in the field of biology, and it ultimately continued to appear as the only explanation of the origins of man, a man whose nature was described by religion as a contradiction between matter and spirit, body and soul. Darwin\u2019s imperishable glory is to have unveiled the mystery surrounding the origin of life on Earth. The origin of the species was able to win for evolution the great reign of organised living matter; he introduced the dialectical principle of transformation into the field of biology. Since its publication we have known that the eternal motion of matter is not only the origin of celestial bodies, but also of the forms in which life on Earth manifests itself. The myth of the separate creation of species, animal and vegetable, that were thought to be fixed and unchanging, has collapsed as the myth of the stars fixed in the eighth heaven collapsed after Copernicus. In the great Darwinian conception, which immediately met with the agreement of Marx and Engels, the biological world that surrounds us today has not always existed, but is the result of a long and complex transformation, and the animal and plant species living today \u2013 human species included \u2013 are the descendants of extinct species.\n\nBut the real victory of materialist thought lies not so much in the principle of species transformation, but in the fact that biological transformation is explained by absolutely natural factors. In the struggle against a hostile environment (caused, for example, by climate change), living species are forced to develop certain organic functions, to acquire new somatic characteristics which, transmitted hereditarily, end up constituting the fundamental traits of new species, endowed with better organic defences and therefore able to survive. In this way the evolution of the inorganic, mineral world is inseparably linked to the multiform evolution of life. As Engels says, spirit appeared to be the highest level reached by the organisation of matter. In this sense, Darwinism represents a very important stage and a battle won by modern materialist thought.\n\nDarwinism filled a great gap that materialist thought had left behind. The encyclopedists had already achieved such satisfactory results that Engels, a century later, recommended that the German Social Democrats translate and publish their works, and Lenin, following Engels, recommended it to the Russian Communists in 1922. But in their time there was a lack of the precious documentary material accumulated by geographical, geological and paleontological research, which Darwin had to interpret ingeniously in order to read the secret history of life on Earth.\n\nHowever, the materialists, to whom Darwin supplied a formidable weapon in the fight against idealism and religious superstition, did not realise the apparently paradoxical reason why science had had to work much harder to wrest God from the Earth than to wrest him from the sky.\n\nIf, to the shame of the great scientific advances made in the investigation of the universe and of life, religious superstition continued to dominate consciences, this had to be explained above all by a materialistic analysis of the origins of religion. It had to be demonstrated that religious superstition did not have its origin in the \u201cignorance of the masses,\u201d that is, in a cultural condition, but in the oppression of the masses crushed by the mechanism of class domination. Materialism had to tell the supreme truth that religious superstition, which subjugates and puts the masses to sleep, is not the result of a duel of ideas in the secrecy of consciences, but the only non-revolutionary way of reacting to injustice, abuse, unpunished crimes, the reign of terror, inseparably linked to the division of society into economic classes; and that the victory of science over religion cannot be the result of enlightenment preaching, but the necessary consequence of a social transformation that will make the dreadful material condition of the masses disappear. This task could not be left to the thinkers of the bourgeoisie, but only to the vanguard of the class that historically opposes it: to revolutionary communism, to Marxism.\n\nOpenly materialist doctrines have accompanied the progress of scientific research in every age. Materialism was thus born at the time of the republics of classical Greece and Rome. But neither the discoveries of the great scientists of antiquity nor those that laid the foundations of modern science have succeeded in shaking the domination of religion. The bourgeois intellectual can, without changing his social status, reject religious superstition and embrace atheistic doctrines. But for the great masses it is impossible to continue to live in the atrocious conditions imposed by class division and at the same time free themselves from religious beliefs. Religion is the \u201copium of the people,\" the spiritual alcohol, which the masses need to forget their condition and quench their thirst for justice. Only the advanced worker who has broken the chains of resignation and who dedicates himself to the struggle against capitalism by embracing the Marxist programme and theory can get rid of religion.\n\nThere is no other possible explanation for the persistence of religion in spite of scientific progress.\n\n...\n\n**The victory of science is in Marxism**\n\nIt would be useful to continue to follow the fascinating history of life, but that is not the subject of this note. What is important to underline on the occasion of the centenary of The Origin of Species is the inadequacy of non-Marxist materialism, its inability to fight religion victoriously. Here is an enormous mass of scientific discoveries that defeat the principle of the creation of the world out of nothing; here is a reconstruction, obviously in broad outline, of the history of the Earth and the living beings that populate it, without at any point in this marvellous narrative needing to involve a supernatural power! It would seem that religion must have long since disappeared. And what happens instead? With the exception of a small number of people, the great mass of men is still subject to it. This is a phenomenon that non-Marxist materialism is incapable of explaining.\n\nCelebrating the centenary of The Origin of Species, the English biologist Julian Huxley told the University of Chicago, in front of two thousand scientists, that religion is destined to disappear and\n\n\u201cto make way for a new order of ideas, a new logical mentality. In evolutionary thinking there is no longer room or need for supernatural beings capable of changing the course of events. The Earth was not created. It has evolved, and so have all the animals and plants that inhabit it, including ourselves, human beings, souls and spirits, as mere brains and bodies. And thus it evolved into religions. They are organisations of human thought in its integration with the complex, disturbing world with which man has always had to deal \u2026 that is to say, the external world of nature and the world of his own nature.\u201d\n\nHuxley clearly shows the nature of his materialism when he predicts that \u201creligions are destined to disappear in competition with other, truer and wider organisations of thought.\u201d Obviously, the fact that a century of evolutionary confirmation has failed to weaken religion has taught our scientist nothing. He doesn\u2019t know how to apply materialism to history, to the social sciences, just as the bourgeoisie doesn\u2019t know how to do it. Lenin explains this in an article published in 1909, but it is still as relevant today as it was 50 years ago:\n\n\u201cWhy does religion retain its hold on the backward sections of the town proletariat, on broad sections of the semi-proletariat, and on the mass of the peasantry? Because of the ignorance of the people, replies the bourgeois progressist, the radical or the bourgeois materialist. And so: \u2018Down with religion and long live atheism; the dissemination of atheist views is our chief task!\u2019 The Marxist says that this is not true, that it is a superficial view, the view of narrow bourgeois uplifters. It does not explain the roots of religion profoundly enough; it explains them, not in a materialist but in an idealist way. In modern capitalist countries these roots are mainly\u00a0*social.*\u201d (Lenin, \u201cOn the Attitude of the Workers\u2019 Party to Religion\u201d, Works, volume 15, p.436)\n\nThis is an example of the application of materialism in the \u201cfield of social sciences\u201d! That\u2019s the difference between bourgeois materialism and dialectical materialism! This is, above all, the reason why we have defined the Darwinist revolution only as a stage of materialist thought, even if Darwinism is able, in the light of the latest acquisitions of biochemistry, to explain the evolution of the biological world in a materialist way! Lenin\u2019s text shows the impotence of bourgeois materialism to explain social phenomena.\n\nThe materialist scholar contemplates the mass of documents confirming the crushing defeat of religion in the critical and doctrinal field, and he is amazed to note that in the social field, it is science that is defeated in the struggle against the influence of religion on the spirits. He is unable to discern the \u201croots\u201d of religion because, while he studies nature in a materialistic way, he persists on the contrary in considering social facts in an idealistic way, as if they were the implementation of such and such ideas. This method must be completely reversed and we must consider \u201cwhat people think as a consequence of who they are socially.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deepest root of religion today is the socially downtrodden condition of the working masses and their apparently complete helplessness in face of the blind forces of capitalism, which every day and every hour inflicts upon ordinary working people the most horrible suffering and the most savage torment, a thousand times more severe than those inflicted by extra-ordinary events, such as wars, earthquakes, etc. \u2018Fear made the gods.\u2019 Fear of the blind force of capital\u2014blind because it cannot be foreseen by the masses of the people\u2014a force which at every step in the life of the proletarian and small proprietor threatens to inflict, and does inflict \u2018sudden\u2019, \u2018unexpected\u2019, \u2018accidental\u2019 ruin, destruction, pauperism, prostitution, death from starvation\u2014such is\u00a0*the root*\u00a0of modern religion which the materialist must bear in mind first and foremost, if he does not want to remain an infant-school materialist. No educational book can eradicate religion from the minds of masses who are crushed by capitalist hard labour, and who are at the mercy of the blind destructive forces of capitalism, until those masses themselves learn to fight this\u00a0*root*\u00a0of religion, fight\u00a0*the rule of capital*\u00a0in all its forms.\u201d (op. Cit.)\n\nThe great victories won by materialist thought, in the epoch of the Copernican revolution and the foundation of modern celestial mechanics, as a hundred years ago in the epoch of the Darwinian revolution, are only partial victories. The secular struggle had to enter the theoretical and critical field in its final battle, when revolutionary communism, personified by Marx and Engels, began the greatest of intellectual revolutions by applying materialism to the study of social forms and the laws that presided over their succession. It was not enough to drive god out of heaven, it was not enough to drive him out of the Earth, it was still necessary to drive him out of society. This is why Engels, at the tomb of Karl Marx, expressed himself in this way:\n\n\u201cJust as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.\"\n\nIt is thus in Marxism that the long and difficult struggle of materialism against ideology and religion, of materialism that developed into dialectical materialism, is victoriously concluded. But if the struggle is won on the field of criticism, it is still open on the social field. If the basis of religion in the capitalist countries is the capitalist mode of production of material means, its suppression in the consciousness of the masses depends on social revolution. This does not mean that Marxist communists renounce atheist propaganda. Avoiding attacking religion or reducing atheist propaganda to the level of dull anti-clericalism for fear of losing some parliamentary mandate is typical of the renegades of the communist movement. But the Marxist communists subordinate the religious struggle to their fundamental task, to the \u201cdevelopment of the class struggle of the exploited masses against their exploiters.\u201d\n\nUnder capitalism, in the terrible conditions in which almost the entire human species now lives, crushed by the tyrannical power of capital, and perpetually terrorised by the spectre of war, the struggle between religion and science is condemned to conclude with the defeat of science, in spite of all its progress and all its discoveries. It is the oppression of wage-labour that engenders religion, it is despair, fear of misery and civil death, and above all the false conviction that nothing can be done against the omnipotence of capital. It is social hell that irresistibly engenders the aspiration for a heavenly paradise. If the masses were not subject to such feelings of pessimism and despair, the grotesque threats and promises of the priests would not meet with any echo. Only the politically educated worker, who has learned to fight against capitalism, understands that he no longer needs God and acquires a scientific mentality.\n\nThe struggle for the triumph of science over religious superstition, begun four centuries ago, will end with the communist revolution. Whoever is not a dialectical materialist will never be able to understand that it belongs to the uncultivated class, the class that produces the material means of existence, to ensure the victory of science.\n\n*Source: \u201cIl Programma Comunista\u201c,\u00a0N. 23, 1959.*",
