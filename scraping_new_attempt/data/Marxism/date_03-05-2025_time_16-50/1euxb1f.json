    "selftext": "My understanding is that when marxists refer to \"peasants\" they speak of rural populations that work the land and nominally \"own\" it but are still subject to feudal obligations under an aristocracy. Is this accurate? Where are the limits of peasants as a class? \n\nIn post-revolutionary France and much of Europe after the abolition of serfdom, rural peasants were increasingly subject to market relations compared to feudal codes. Many were proletarianized, but my understanding is that people who owned land, either communally or legally, were still referred to as peasants. What differentiated them from, say, Yeomen farmers in the US? Were these small family farmers just American peasants?  ",

            "body": "\"At the bottom of all the classes, save the last one, was the huge exploited mass of the nation,\u00a0the peasants. It was the peasant who carried the burden of all the other strata of society: princes, officialdom, nobility, clergy, patricians and middle-class. Whether the peasant was the subject of a prince, an imperial baron, a bishop, a monastery or a city, he was everywhere treated as a beast of burden, and worse. If he was a serf, he was entirely at the mercy of his master. If he was a bondsman, the legal deliveries stipulated by agreement were sufficient to crush him; even they were being daily increased. Most of his time, he had to work on his master\u2019s estate. Out of that which he earned in his few free hours, he had to pay tithes, dues, ground rents, war taxes, land taxes, imperial taxes, and other payments. He could neither marry nor die without paying the master. Aside from his regular work for the master, he had to gather litter, pick strawberries, pick bilberries, collect snail-shells, drive the game for the hunting, chop wood, and so on. Fishing and hunting belonged to the master. The peasant saw his crop destroyed by wild game. The community meadows and woods of the peasants had almost everywhere been forcibly taken away by the masters. And in the same manner as the master reigned over the peasant\u2019s property, he extended his willfulness over his person, his wife and daughters. He possessed the right of the first night. Whenever he pleased, he threw the peasant into the tower, where the rack waited for him just as surely as the investigating attorney waits for the criminal in our times. Whenever he pleased, he killed him or ordered him beheaded. None of the instructive chapters of the Carolina\u00a0which speaks of \u201ccutting of ears,\u201d \u201ccutting of noses,\u201d \u201cblinding,\u201d \u201cchopping of fingers,\u201d \u201cbeheading,\u201d \u201cbreaking on the wheel,\u201d \u201cburning,\u201d \u201cpinching with burning tongs,\u201d \u201cquartering,\u201d etc., was left unpractised by the gracious lord and master at his pleasure. Who could defend the peasant? The courts were manned by barons, clergymen, patricians, or jurists, who knew very well for what they were being paid. Not in vain did all the official estates of the empire live on the exploitation of the peasants.\n\n\nIncensed as were the peasants under terrific pressure, it was still difficult to arouse them to revolt. Being spread over large areas, it was highly difficult for them to come to common understanding; the old habit of submission inherited from generation to generation, the lack of practise in the use of arms in many regions, the unequal degree of exploitation depending on the personality of the master, all combined to keep the peasant quiet.\"\n\n- Engels, the Peasant War in Germany.",

            "body": "The other comments so far are all good. I\u2019ll add that Ellen Meiksins-Wood gives a helpful definition of the peasantry in her book Peasant-Citizen and Slave:\u00a0\n\n>Peasants have been defined \u2014 in contrast to \u2018primitive agriculturalists\u2019 \u2014 as cultivators who depend for their subsistence on certain rights in land and family labor, but who are involved in a \u2018wider economic system\u2019 which includes non-peasants. Essential to this definition is the fact that the peasant family operates as a productive unit (rather than as an \u2018entrepreneurial unit\u2019, as in the modern family farm) \\[\u2026\\] More specifically, peasants have been characterized as \u2018rural cultivators whose surpluses are transferred to a dominant group of rulers that uses the surpluses both to underwrite its own standard of living and to distribute the remainder to groups in society that do not farm but must be fed for their specific goods and services in turn\u2019. The production of a \u2018fund of rent\u2019 \u2014 the payment in labour, produce, or money to someone who \u2018exercises an effective superior power, or domain, over a cultivator\u2019 \u2014 is, by this definition regarded as the characteristic \u2018which critically distinguishes the peasant from the primitive cultivator\u2019, whether that \u2018rent\u2019 takes the form of payments to private landlords or a tax or corvee labour for some state or religious authority, It has been a general characteristic of peasants that a large proportion of their surplus production has been accounted for by rent and/or taxes (55).\n\nSo, as others have noted, while peasants include agricultural laborers who have certain rights in the land (and who rely essentially on family labor), that they\u2019re subject to feudal obligations is unnecessary. In other words, not all peasants are serfs.\u00a0\n\nThe American case is complex. Prior to the American Revolution, in the northern and middle colonies, merchant capital was unable to maintain an effective monopoly on the land. The colonial militias and British Imperial army could only enforce land claims within the (relatively) densely populated cities, so freed servants were able to squat on expropriated Indian frontier land without having to pay any rent. This enabled them to carry out independent household production of use-values. These families operated as subsistence farmers who consumed their own product, marketing only their surplus to trade with merchants for the things that they couldn\u2019t produce themselves (e.g., nails, gunpowder, etc.). Similarly, in the South, while large planters producing tobacco took up all the best plots of land, free servants and poor whites were able to take up land in the backcountry at little to no cost and carry out independent subsistence farming like the small farmers in the North. On Meiksins-Wood\u2019s definition, these subsistence farmers are not peasants; they\u2019re \u201cprimitive agriculturalists.\u201d\n\nBut after the Revolution and the Constitutional Settlement, the United States created a corps of tax collectors, backed by a standing army, capable of enforcing land claims. This fueled land speculation among wealthy merchants, as well as large investment into transportation infrastructure (subsidized by the merchant-dominated northern governments). As a result, land prices in the North began to rise. At the same time, taxes were also rising to the North to pay back debts incurred during the Revolutionary War. So, from 1780-1840, northern independent household farmers increasingly had to engage in commodity production to pay rising land prices and taxes, and thus the farmers were increasingly thrust into petty commodity production. \n\nThose farmers who were unable to compete lost access to their land and became wage laborers. Those who succeeded would ultimately go on to take out debt from merchant capital to expand and develop their operations, hire wage laborers to replace family labor, and ultimately become America's agro-industrial, manufacturing capitalist class. However, in that window from 1780-1840 when petty commodity production was  established but not yet transformed into full fledged commodity production with industrial capital, the northern farmers count as peasants on Wood\u2019s definition. These farmers still had rights to their land and ownership over the means of production, and with their families, they operated as a productive unit, but post-Revolution they had rent obligations to private landlords and tax obligations to the American state. Hence, an increasingly large portion of their product was extracted by superior powers.   \n  \nIn the South, poor white subsistence farmers maintained their condition as subsistence farmers (up to the Civil War) by allying with large planters against any increased tax obligations after the Revolutionary War. (There was also no threat of land speculation because they lived on undesirable land.) So, these farmers were still primitive agriculturalists, not peasants. The dominated slave populations were also not peasants, since they didn\u2019t have any rights in their land, nor did they operate with their family as a productive unit. As for the share-croppers that emerged after the Civil War, they would count as peasants. These were groups of former slaves who contracted with large planters together. Each family within the group would receive a 40-80 acre plot, along with tools, seeds, fertilizer, and work animals. They\u2019d then use those means of production which they effectively controlled to produce for their own subsistence as well as a surplus crop that they\u2019d pay to the planter at the time of harvest.\u00a0",

            "body": "Agricultural working class. They typically didn't own land, only leased it from the lord of the manor. Some might own one or two working cattle, though again, typically, they'd lease one from their lord.\n\nThe early middle ages to the late middle ages, they generally weren't subject to wage labor, instead being compelled by feudal obligations to work their lord's land and to give the lord some portion of their own product, from the land that they leased from the lord of the manor.\n\nThat began to change in the late middle ages. Feudal society in Northern Europe pivoted to socage starting in the 1300s, which became normal by the 1600s. Other parts of Europe were slower to adopt it, but varied mixes of socage and corvee existed through the late medieval and early modern periods. This was in part because of laws in some regions that banned subinfeudation\u2013 the creating of feudal entities within existing feudal entities\u2013 and in a large part due to a gradual development of a cash economy after the Crusades, as luxury commodities from the east flowed into Catholic Europe and new contacts connected them with trade coming from Persia and China and India.\n\nFeudalism became increasingly constrained at the same time that a thriving market economy was developing across Western Europe. It wasn't yet capitalism\u2013 that would still be a couple centuries off\u2013 but the seeds were being planted. The demand for luxury commodities drove the feudal nobility to switch to demanding rent in cash (socage) from their peasants rather than as work obligations (corvee), so that they would have money with which to engage in this developing market economy.\n\nSo, the peasantry pivoted towards wage labor in an increased ratio throughout the late middle ages. The Black Death actually had a profound effect on this, as losing a third to half the population caused a collapse of the labor market. Peasants organized and demanded better wages, and for the most part, they got them. In some places, like England, they even were able to agitate for significant changes to the system of feudal obligations, including greater freedom of movement.",
