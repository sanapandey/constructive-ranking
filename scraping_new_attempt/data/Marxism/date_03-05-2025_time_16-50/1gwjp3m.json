Does this ring any bells with anyone? Looking for a citation.",

The prehistory [Vorgeschichte] of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.",

Social construction and psycho-physical self-education will become two aspects of one and the same process. All the arts \u2013 literature, drama, painting, music and architecture will lend this process beautiful form. More correctly, the shell in which the cultural construction and self-education of Communist man will be enclosed, will develop all the vital elements of contemporary art to the highest point. Man will become immeasurably stronger, wiser and subtler; his body will become more harmonized, his movements more rhythmic, his voice more musical. The forms of life will become dynamically dramatic. The average human type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx. And above this ridge new peaks will rise.",
