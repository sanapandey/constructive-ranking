    "selftext": "People say conservatives are growing lot in Canada like the US and Canada has some one like Trump called Pierre Poilievre and base on the voting polls if there was election in Canada Pierre Poilievre could get most of the votes and get majority government.\n\nSo how conservative his he or how dangerous is Pierre Poilievre compared to Trump?\n\nOn side note Justin Trudeau is on track to announce his resignation of the liberal party. In Canada Justin Trudeau is rank very low among the Canadian people now.\n\nPeople in Canada are super angry at Justin Trudeau and there growing of movement to the Conservative Party. \n\nI believe most this is because the liberal party of Canada like the NDP party is in bed with capitalism system and when they get voted in very little changes. With education and healthcare getting very little money from the government along with crumbling roads, sky high homelessness every where, out of control sky high housing cost, high inflation, long with crumbling infrastructure and no state one of energy sector and out control food prices.\n\nIt seems when times are bad people vote conservative. Some people say Canada like the US is in late stage capitalism and that is why things are so bad.\n\nIs Pierre Poilievre very dangerous like Trump?\n",

I watched Canada go from opening her tender arms to young people resisting orders to go kill farmers in Vietnam, to trashing what was once the best public health system in the world by embracing the neoliberal economic project as the general population got bamboozled by the same crew of con men and carnival barkers that hypnotized us Yanks. Sad days.",

As a means of \u201creconciling\u201d it\u2019s genocidal past AND present (as well as a profound history of racial exclusion; Chinese head tax, komagata Maru etc.), Canada has successfully rebranded itself; and this fa\u00e7ade occludes the political economy of multiculturalism. \n\nMulticulturalism is well-loved in Canada if it means exoticized foods, garments, and media are readily mass-consumed. Multiculturalism is well-received so long that these \u201cother\u201d populations are productive, obedient, assimilate, and an exploitable labour force. Multiculturalism is loved because it stabilizes a particular matrix of state power: not because people themselves deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, or humanity \u2014 but because only the \u201c*good ones* \u201c do. \n\nRacism is rampant in canada, but saving some empty feel-good platitudes about diversity and tolerance seems to do numbers",
