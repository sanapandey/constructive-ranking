    "selftext": "Newbie to Marxist ideology here. Marx wrote a lot, so I wanted to ask if someone could point me in the right direction about a topic I'm interested about.\n\nNamely, the dynamics of power and oppression beyond the class paradigm: the position and role of ethnic minorities in a state, how the working class can and does inflict violence upon minorities, how the bourgeoisie exploits and endorses that violence as a means of control of the working class. \n\nIt would be relevant for me that Marx specifically recognizes the existence and particular issues of ethnic minorities and their struggles as victims of the bourgeoisie and the majority working-class both.",

Marx had quite a bit more to say about ethnic and racial domination than he is often presented as, and these books are useful orientations toward those questions.",

                            "body": "Marx did address aspects of the Ottoman Empire and broader Middle Eastern dynamics in the 19th century, but he didn't specifically focus on the \"minorities issue\" or directly critique Arab imperialism in a way we might today expect. His focus leaned more toward analyzing European imperialism, particularly British and French, and their impacts on regions like the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn his articles and correspondence, Marx critiqued how European powers sought control over the Ottoman Empire, often manipulating its internal divisions and regional dynamics. While he had opinions on the complex socio-economic and political conditions in the empire, his perspective didn't extensively delve into local ethnic or religious minorities.\n\nHis analysis of imperialism didn't center as much on the historical nuances of Arab expansion or influence over centuries but more on 19th-century capitalism and colonialism.",

The letters of the British officers are redolent of malignity. An officer writing from Peshawur gives a description of the disarming of the 10th irregular cavalry for not charging the 55th native infantry when ordered to do so. He exults in the fact that they were not only disarmed, but stripped of their coats and boots, and after having received 12d. per man, were marched down to the river side, and there embarked in boats and sent down the Indus, where the writer is delighted to expect every mother\u2019s son will have a chance of being drowned in the rapids. Another writer informs us that, some inhabitants of Peshawur having caused a night alarm by exploding little mines of gunpowder in honor of a wedding (a national custom), the persons concerned were tied up next morning, and \u201creceived such a flogging as they will not easily forget.\u201d - Marx on the Indian revolt.* \n\n  \n*After that affair one might almost believe that the English proletarian movement in its old traditional Chartist form must perish utterly before it can evolve in a new and viable form. And yet it is not possible to foresee what the new form will look like. It seems to me, by the way, that there is in fact a connection between Jones\u2019\u00a0new move, seen in conjunction with previous more or less successful attempts at such an alliance, and the fact that the English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that the ultimate aim of this most bourgeois of all nations would appear to be the possession,\u00a0alongside\u00a0the bourgeoisie, of a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat. - Engels, in a letter to Marx.* [*https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1858/letters/58\\_10\\_07.htm*](https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1858/letters/58_10_07.htm)",

The political writings are a richer vein here but if you don\u2019t know the history they are likewise difficult to follow. The entire series of works on the national revolutions of 1848 and the many works on Poland are in the second of the 3 Penguin volumes. There\u2019s also a useful collection of \u201cMarx and Engels on Ireland\u201d; Marx became convinced of the centrality of the Irish question to the English proletariat in a way that anticipated a lot of contemporary leftist and postcolonial thinking. Anti-Irish sentiment along with the relatively higher rate of exploitation of Irish immigrant labor led English workers to resent them and think of themselves as a kind of labor aristocracy. Such divisions were and are ruinous to the workers\u2019 movement in England above and beyond the ghastly oppression in Ireland that gave rise to it. Also the volume \u201cThe Civil War in the United States\u201d naturally touches on racism in America",

As for specific readings, you can look up \"Notes on Indian history\" for an extended discussion of that topic (and a quite representative sample of his views on imperialism)",

When the United States annexed California after the Mexican War, Marx sarcastically asked, \u201cIs it a misfortune that magnificent California was seized from the lazy Mexicans who did not know what to do with it?\u201d\n\nEngels shared Marx\u2019s contempt for Mexicans, explaining: \u201cIn America we have witnessed the conquest of Mexico and have rejoiced at it. It is to the interest of its own development that Mexico will be placed under the tutelage of the United States.\u201d\n\nMarx on slavery:\n(the original letter is in German; words written in English are capitalised):\n\nThe only thing of definite interest in the book is the comparison   between Negro slavery as formerly practised by the English in Jamaica and elsewhere, and Negro slavery in the United States. He demonstrates how the main STOCK of Negroes in Jamaica always consisted of freshly imported BARBARIANS, since their treatment by the English meant not only that the Negro population was not   maintained, but also that 2/3 of the yearly imports always went to waste, whereas the present generation of Negroes in America is a native product, more or less Yankeefied, English speaking, etc., and hence capable of being emancipated.",
