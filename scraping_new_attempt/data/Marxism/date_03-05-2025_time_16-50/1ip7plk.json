    "selftext": "I was wondering if there was a Marxist analysis of why some prices are higher in poorer countries, even those of products produced in those countries.\n\nFor example, my country, Croatia, is currently having extremely high prices for everything, from groceries to apartments. In Germany, which is richer country, economically more powerful, etc., prices for the same product, even those produced in Croatia, are cheaper. Even across the border in Slovenia, prices can be significantly lower.\n\nIs it just bad country leadership as the liberals say, or is there some more insightful Marxist analysis?",

If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

            "body": "Croatia is insanely expensive for what the average wage is there. The same thing in Lidl here in Slovenia can be almost half as cheaper it is there.\n\nI can't give a better Marxist analysis other than that it's just maximizing profits by capitalists that have formed monopolies (afaik in croatia it's the market chains and importers), as capital usually does. The monopolies in Croatia I think are because the few importers and chains that there are have formed cartels. They can afford to do that because the state works to protect them (which is the state's job in a capitalist mode of production), and because Croatia relies a lot on tourism, and tourists usually have more disposable income and are prepared to pay more.\n\nNow that you're in the EU, this is even more pronounced, because the whole point of the EU is to enable value extraction by its capitalist class from the EU members in its periphery.\n\nAs to why something like that doesn't happen in Germany to such a large extend, I don't know. My guess would be that the importers there are big enough that they can't easily form such cartels, so they have an actual race to the bottom of profit margins with each other, but they can then use countries like Croatia as new markets from which to extract value when they can't do it locally anymore.\n\nPlease note that this is all just my conjecture and understanding, so someone please correct me if I'm not being dialectical :)",

From my experience, Croatia has a very reactionary society, so the road to actual proletarian unity is very long.",
