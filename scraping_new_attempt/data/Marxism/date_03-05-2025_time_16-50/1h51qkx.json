In discussing revolutionary potential, he says it's only the proletariat that can accomplish the overthrow of the bourgeois state. But he makes a differentiation between the proletariat and other \"toiling and exploited masses\". I thought proletariat meant working class, generally? Is there some particular distinction associated to this word used here? Thanks in advance for your eyeballs and your time!",

Classes in Marxism (and by extension Leninism) can be easily understood by their relation to the surplus. The proletariat creates a surplus through its labor but cannot decide how that surplus is utilized. The bourgeoisie appropriates this surplus and decides what to do with it (reinvests it in the capital accumulation process, buys a yacht, etc). If you understand class in this way, you can understand how a peasant farming in the Russian countryside at the beginning of the 20th century has a different relation to the surplus when compared to an urban factory worker. This is all just theory. It's what Lenin was understanding about the material conditions of a given place at a given time. Some of it is applicable now, some of it is less easily applicable but still useful to understand. Hopefully that illuminates things a little bit. Don't take what I'm saying as hard and fast assertions to the truth. I'm not the smartest guy just rambling in hopes you understand the material a little better. :)",

They work the land they were born subject to. They aren't working in the factories and taking home wages and organizing unions. The economic relations around the peasants are different, and so they might have different interests than the working class.\u00a0\n\n\nMarx observing the industrial era and the bourgeois revolutions of his time thought the working class is uniquely positioned to be able to realize their own freedom and change the course of history. Their relationship to the means of production in industrial capitalism, the machines, is crucial. The peasants dont have leverage to demand change, isolated and confined to their plots, but the factory workers do if they become conscious of their revolutionary potential and organize to that end. So from a Marxist perspective the working class specifically has to be the class to lead the other classes that make up the masses because they are the class that can organize to use the machines for human freedom instead of human subjugation\u00a0",

Your confusion might arise from Marx and Engels, writing in the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_:\n\n>Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\n\nThe trend, already apparent in 1848 Germany, was toward two classes. However that was merely the trend and Russia was further behind the trend than Prussia. The proletariat is the revolutionary class, in part, because of the way the capitalist ruling class bring the workers together under one roof and with the same struggles\u2014where they can communicate directly with one another and organize.\n\nThough in Russia, unlike most everywhere else, the peasants were also organized into agricultural communes, and Marx thought this form of organization could accelerate the revolution in Russia\u2014especially when that revolution is conducted in solidarity with other counties with a more developed proletarian class.",

            "body": "There are more than one working Class.\n\n\nClass is, at its heart, a political differentiation caused by differences in peoples economic relations reaching such a large degree of difference that they produce a qualitative break in either the interests or political representation of a group of people.\n\n\n\nFor example, there are elements of Class distinction between owners of Industrial Capital and owners of Financial Capital that become especially prominent in the stage of Imperialism. They own qualitatively different forms of Capital, applied to different practical uses, and benefit from Imperialism in qualitatively different ways.\n\n\nThe Industrialist don't make money directly off the Usury of Financial Lending to other Nations, and so for example a contemporary example they have no direct interest in Ukraine. They have potential profits to be made off the exploitation of resources and labor power, but have no sunk cost themselves. The Financialists conversely do have direct interests, having already expended significant amounts of Capital, both through bank lending and direct investment of Financial Capital, eg Blackrock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs applies to the Working Classes, there are the Proletariat who are forced to sell their Labor Power on the market to provide for themselves. There are also the Peasantry/individual producers (think self-employed) who do not sell their Labor Power, but sell it's products. There are also Lumpen Prols who don't participate in the legal, regulated economy (eg drug dealers, prostitutes, etc) and economic relations closely related to the Serf where they/their product is not held as the natural property of another person, but is owed to them as rent/protection money/patronage, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen talking about Class we mostly talk about the largest classes, which have historically represented a vast majority of society. For example, the technically-defined Proletariat makes up more than 70% of the population in highly industrialized economies. In the past, Serfs and Peasants made up as much as 95% of society.",

Like literally the entire point. People have always produced what they needed to survive. The whole thing that enables classed society is that now people can produce a lot more than they individually consume. So some people (the owning class; masters, lords, capitalists) can take others' (the working class; slaves, peasants, proletariat) surplus. \n\nBut also just because there's no wages doesn't mean they aren't getting something external to what they themselves are producing. Peasants could potentially be provided with tools and other resources from their lords. Idk, I'm really just winging it here.\n\nAlso the commons are crucial to understand. The enclosure of the commons is the classic example of capitalist primitive accumulation. The commons were land that was held in common by the peasants that they relied on for all sorts of things, like fuel (wood), grazing their livestock, and herbs and whatnot. Plus communal events and activities. Peasants didn't _just_ work on their crops every day. But with the introduction and growth of capital, the commons slowly got privatized (essentially), restricting the peasants' access to the commons, which meant they needed to buy those resources, which meant they needed money, which meant wage labor jobs, thus the beginnings of proletarianization and urbanization.",
