In the US, liberty is valued so highly that nearly every product is framed as increasing invidivual choice and autonomy. Firearms are powerful and violence is exciting: thus, guns inherently carry a sense of freedom and power. Add America's rebellious frontier history, the Civil War, and several global wars to that cocktail--> and boom, firearms are encoded as the tools of liberty and progress. Given this history and environment, the reactionary obsession with guns seems pretty straightforward and understandable (though not justified or wise). \n\nI am curious if pro-2nd Amendment leftists understand how pervasive and powerful for-profit marketing can be, and if they've considered the possibility that this perceived connection between firearms and Marxist revolution may actually be another form of capitalist exploitation.",

That shit got shut down. You might see a deer hunter with a 1940's SMLE but that's about it. Career criminals might have pistols but it's extremely rare. Cops carry small arms but they have to go through all sorts of questioning if they ever draw them even if they don't fire. We don't have dick-measuring ammosexual shit going on - you can have a gun if you want one, you just have to demonstrate why it's a good idea to have one. \n\nAnd there has not been a mass-shooting event in 30 years.  The cops don't have military-surplus tanks policing communities. Nobody has got up on the roof of a building and opened fire on their neighbors with an AR15. Our kids don't do active-shooter drills at school. Most people have never seen a gun, let alone handled one.",

But also also surely it isn't a good idea for everybody to have weapons of mass destruction available, given the general misanthropy created by capitalism.

The rest of the world don't see the need for 2nd amendment type of freedom, and don't have the same level of gun violence problem compared to the US, as a result (I think). \n\n  \n1. 2nd amendment was made when guns were just a bit better than muskets. Guns back then were just a bit more effective than using swords to kill people. The writer of that amendment couldn't imagine a rifle that can dispense 600 bullets in just 1 minute.  \n2. Second amendment were written to anticipate the return of British military. Americans need to be able to quickly form militias equipped with weapons to combat the invaders. Now that British return is a far away possibility, the amendment sounds ridiculous. In addition, modern weapons makes rifles almost completely useless if facing a modern army invasion.\n\nNow this archaic rules just creates problem for the US: mass shootings and school shootings. Only entities profiting from the 2nd are the rifle producers.\n\nMy questions are then: Do you need to own guns? If your hobby is shooting, can't you just go to the range and rent a gun there? If you need guns to let's say shoot a bear, does it have to be automatic rifles? If you need guns in case robbers enter your house, do you really think you can reach your guns before the robbers? Are you certain you won't friendly fire your family? If you need guns to fight a tyrannical government, do you understand how tanks and artillery works? If you think guns are like any other commodities, such as cars or hunting knives, then bad news for you, they are not the same.\n\nAs a Marxist, I think guns are needed to fight imperialists and facists, if you are oppressed.

And the dilemma of mass and over consumerism.  \n\nHowever, as another commentor acknowledged, something that completely slipped my mind. Gun ownership is more private ownership than property as it doesn't produce anything as it is a tool of its own degree. I can it be argued american rights and libertarians especially take gun ownership to an extreme. That extreme being, it mainly raises  concern that it exceeds the individuals contentment for ownership  and is a mass (if you consider this) an exploit of various metals and polymer for private gain. \n\nMarx would likley argue, as one who loved to smoked and drink. That there are social norms to some extent of hobbyist collection. He would likely be a product of his time, be able to acknowledge a need for guns as a tool for hunting and on interpretation, for revolution. Giving an open space for some allowance.\n\nFor metals and polymer guns nowadays, typically as  Mas produced as they are, they consist of a wide variety of Metals for different parts and modifications.

Do you think the bourgeois is going to withhold using the most advanced weaponry against us, if people decide to rise up? Think we actually stand a chance against drones, smart bombs and detailed satellite imagery? Other forms of advanced technology that I probably don\u2019t even know exists? What good is your assault rifle in that situation, especially when those same assault rifles are being actively used for acts of terror and mayhem in public places, acts that have zero relevancy to revolutionary aims? Unless we\u2019re able to radicalize the military itself against the power structure it\u2019s sworn to protect? If you have constructive input as how to achieve without completely decimating and pointlessly sacrificing millions, I\u2019m open to suggestions. \n\nThey can \u201cpurge\u201d us any time they choose, especially if provoked.",
