    "selftext": "For those that don't know, [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement) is:\n\n>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is a lifestyle/investment plan with the goal of gaining financial independence and retiring early through savings.\n\nThe essential story is that if you put all of your long term savings into the equities market if you save hard enough then at some point the dividends and capital growth will sustain all of your living expenses.\n\nYou then have the option (though not the obligation, of course) to retire and never work again and your capital will sustain you indefinitely. That is to say, other people's labor could sustain you indefinitely. There are various definitions, but the most generally accepted form is that your liquid wealth matches or exceeds either 3.5% or 4% of your living expenses. I question many things about the movement, but I think that the calculations are sound.\n\nObviously (for you) the entire purpose of the \"fire movement\" is to join the petit bourgeoisie and then the bourgeoisie. For some the dream is realistic and for others it is a pipe dream. If you feel like looking at a community of people who are aware, look at /r/fatfire (warning: not safe for lunch).\n\nThe reason I find this interesting from a Marxist perspective is that:\n\nA) I think that the inflexion point provides the closest thing we've got in our culture to a *sharp* dividing line between the membership of the \"bourgeoisie\" and \"not bourgeoisie\" (modern cultural definitions of \"working class\" and \"middle class\" are all over the fucking map).\n\nB) The concept was *a creation of capitalism itself* that maps 1:1 to a marxist concept.\n\nC) It which requires zero class consciousness for somebody to be able to place themselves on either side of the divide. A member of the bourgeoisie would read about Marxism and hesitate to declare themselves bourgeoisie. They would have no such hesitation to describe themselves as \"able to fire\". Half of /r/fire is arguing about where to draw that line more precisely - they're doing the work for us.",

Where precisely does the transition happen between proletarian, petit bourgeoisie. and bourgeoisie happen in this scenario? Do you go from proletarian to petit bourgeoisie the instant you get $1 in your 401k? The bourgeoisie has never had to participate in wage labor, so I don\u2019t think this is a novel inflection point ushered in by financial capitalism.\n\nAlthough this is only the case for a slice of people in those subreddits, if we entertain the hypothetical of someone who reaches this FIRE point through savings and investments from a lifetime of wage labor, I think there\u2019s a stronger argument to be made about these type of individuals embodying a contemporary form of the labor aristocracy. One wonders if a majority of individuals in this group will ever \u201cearn\u201d the surplus value appropriated during their wage labor through dividends later in life. For this reason I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s appropriate to even call them petit bourgeoisie.\n\nRegardless, the more important matter is where these groups sympathies lie. And these people certainly have bourgeoisie sympathies and bourgeoisie-aligned interests.\n\nEdit: Sorry to other commentors, I accidentally posted this as replies to top-level comments because of the mobile UI. I deleted them, but probably caused some unnecessary notifications",

To be on the same page I'd appreciate a specific definition for when these individuals reach:\n\n\\- proletarian\n\n\\- petit bourgeoisie\n\n\\- bourgeoisie\n\nI'm assuming your \\~3.5% - %4 number is your definition for bourgeoisie, which makes sense.

The fact that you own only parts of multiple corporations, that is, the fact that you aren't a sole owner of any one business, doesn't mean at all that you aren't a bourgeoisie.\n\nIt infuriates me so much that anti-communists are unable to or are pretending to not understand the very obvious fact that passive income is income you recieve without engaging in labor. Like, believing that the bourgeoisie deserves passive income is one thing, but, in my view, it's more wild to see someone engage in literal reality denial by refusing to admit that passive income is income you recieve without engaging in labor.",

            "body": "It strikes me that the ability to retire and live off investments is already a sign of at least the labor aristocracy, if not petite bourgeois or settler status. Migrant agricultural workers in North America, garment workers in South Asia, they might stop working when they're too old, but they are going to rely on family members, not 401K. Europe, U.S., Canada, etc. have social democratic (aka social fascist) programs to fund older workers' pensions, and these rely on superprofits from imperialism.\n\nThese labor aristocrats do work, but their relationship to capital is different from the fully proletarianized: they share in increasing accumulation of capital through stock investments and often real estate. The land was seized and settled through primitive accumulation, but the reason it is ongoing imperialist relations that drive North American home prices ever higher, to the point that home ownership can be an investment vehicle and help with retirement. At least this is my understanding of imperialism and the international division of labor, and the broad labor aristocracy in Europe and N.A.\n\nSo the case of retiring early is just a difference in degree, not a difference in kind. It is generally, but not always, the labor aristocrats with the very highest salaries (tech, financial services), that can accumulate enough capital investments to stop working especially early.",

All the social functions of the capitalist are now performed by salaried employees. The capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends, tearing off coupons, and gambling on the Stock Exchange, where the different capitalists despoil one another of their capital.\" - [Friedrich Engels, Anti-Duhring, 1877](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch24.htm)\n\nYes, stock ownership (like any other sort of company ownership) is bourgeoisie. Yes, living off of passive income generated by stock ownership is bourgeoisie. 62% of Americans own stock and those that do would be happy to live off of it. Most of them will never be able to do it, of course, but that makes them petit bourgeoisie instead of haute bourgeoisie - they still need to do labor in order to make a living, and their \"bourgeoisie\" status is precarious.\n\n>I think that the inflexion point provides the closest thing we've got in our culture to a\u00a0*sharp*\u00a0dividing line between the membership of the \"bourgeoisie\" and \"not bourgeoisie\" (modern cultural definitions of \"working class\" and \"middle class\" are all over the fucking map).\n\nI don't see the point of appealing to cultural definitions.

Having hundreds of dollars of stock in your retirement account making pennies in dividends doesnt change your relationship to capital at ALL. Without a job you are still fucked.\n\n\nThe bourgeoisie have often tried to use a bit of subtle misdirection with this figure and it sounds a little like you are bought in.... \"Oh, 62% of Americans *are like us*\". No, only the ones who have significant holdings are like them. 62% of america is NOT petit bourgeoisie. Nowhere close.\n\n\n>I don't see the point of appealing to cultural definitions. The Marxist ones exist for a reason, and the non-Marxist ones were developed to muddy the lines between one class and another.\n\n\nIn this case the cultural definition matches the Marxist one precisely and does not muddy any lines.\n\n\nThis is not \"working class means eating at McDonalds and enjoying football\". Nothing close. It's accurate and precise.\n\n\nI find your comment...odd. Rephrased it sounds like \"Why would I want to discuss Marxism with a non Marxist?\"",
