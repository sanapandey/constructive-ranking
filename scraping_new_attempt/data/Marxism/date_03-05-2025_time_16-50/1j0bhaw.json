With there being a proposed \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d today, February 28th, it seems that popular opinion lies with labor. I wanna hear opinions on it, criticisms of it, how it could be improved, etc.",

Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

            "body": "Hello\n\nThe two things you mention are fundamentally separated and different from one another. \n\nThe UAW et al collaboration effort to have a pseudo-general strike occur on May Day of 2028 is a stellar example of organized labor activism that hasn\u2019t been seen in the United States in a while. This is in large part due to a lack of class consciousness and the American bourgeois hostile takeover of American labor unions. Shawn Fain is the first labor organizer in a long time that genuinely seems to have working class interest at the forefront of his priorities.\n\nThis \u201ceconomic blackout\u201d and generally all \u201cReddit based protests\u201d are ineffective, disorganized, and not socialist. These are liberal protests to the contradictions of our liberal system, and therefore will not solve these contradictions in any meaningful way. It probably does represent a baseline of class consciousness, yes, but class warfare has to be done in an organized and coordinated fashion or else it will fail every time. This is why most of these \u201cdon\u2019t buy from Amazon for a week\u201d protests are not only self-flattery but also completely ineffective.",

Is that about right?(still trying to understand praxis and all that)",

In the past there have been boycotts that compounded the lost profits of those corporations being struck.  Of course the classic way to do this is to direct attention away from problematic companies by designating some safe replacement purchases for boycotters (which can be from the population as a whole).  So in short support from the population is what takes a successful strike to the level of consciousness-raising: plenty of economic tactics to achieve that solidarity action amongst the population.  Boycott, divest, direct action, legal investigation, building bridges to the culture, coordinated messaging, counter-programming.",

There's some vague allusion to collective power and anti-corporatism, but the movement is largely \"vote with your wallet.\" The economic effects will be net zero because people will just go back to their normal spending habits afterwards. As far as I can tell, there are also no clear, specific demands nor is their a centralized goal. We will see with the subsequent blackouts but I assume this will go as any decentralized, individualistic movement does; nowhere.
