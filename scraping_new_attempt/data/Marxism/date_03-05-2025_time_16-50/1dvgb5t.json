Perhaps I misudnerstand, the idea is that those of us that are class consciousness must play an integral role in social change. It is obvious that most of society, at least here in the UK, is not class conscious. That doesnt mean the masses are stupid, it's a consequence of years of socialism being misrepresented and marginalised in discourse. Of course people won't thus be class conscious. But did Lenin not advocate listening to workers, not just talking down to or lecturing them? So why does that characterisation persist?\n\nOr am I just talking to the wrong people.",

The vanguard party's aims include seizing state power, anarchists aim to abolish state power. I would also say that anarchists don't generally put listening to or empowering workers high on their priority list as compared to marxists.\n\nAll this is not to say that anarchists don't organize, but their organizing methods and the structure of their organizations are a little bit more liquid than solid.",

My experience with anarchists has been them building and strengthening communities so that they are at least more resilient to the state\u2019s overreach and violence.

I see a hell of a lot more converts coming from community gardens than universities.

Your plan for central organization will not go away.

I'm not saying anything Racist about the Arabs. I'm talking about Arab Imperialism. Talking about Arab & Muslim Imperialism is not Racist in itself.\n\nFacts? \n\nWhat facts are being disregarded? \n\nThe fact that Arabs invaded & colonised Israel Land between 7th Century & c 1250ad with continuing migrations afterwards?\n\nThe Fact that the Hebrew Nation survived the imperialism of the Assyrians, of the Babylonians, of the Persians, of the arabs, of the Greeks, of the Romans, of the arabs, of the Turks after founding their Nation State over 3000 years ago?\n\nYou decry western Imperialism while turning a blind eye to non-western Imperialism.\n\nPalestine is simply nothing but an Arab Imperialist Project.\n\nI've never heard of anyone ever saying that Native American Nations or Maori or Aboriginal don't exist. I don't really know anything about Canada to speak to the situation there ...but given the alliance of Brits & Natives vs French & other Natives & the various Treaties that ensued I'd say that they were well known to exist.\n\nClosest Australia comes was the claim of Terra Nullius which was made ...but that was never made in USA & NZ. You can't make Treaties with Tribes/Nations/People who don't exist. \n\nSaying a Country does not exist is not the same thing as saying a People does not exist btw.\n\nPalestinians are Arabs who belong to the Arab Nation.\n\nAs a Jewish-heritage former Judaist Christian Socialist now Muslim Maori Kiwi I can tell you unreservedly that even people here who hate the Maori recognise that they do in fact exist LOL\n\nZionism is not the same thing as Racism btw\n\nI'm not a Capitalist LOL. I'm an Anti-Imperialist Libertarian Socialist who opposes Imperialism wherever it's found whether western, Russian, Chinese, Arab, Turkish.\n\nI believe in Decolonisation & Restitution/Reparations wherever practible. The Hebrew Nation has the right to decolonise their lands of the Arab/Muslim Coloniser.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Turks issued the Edict Of Toleration & Right Of Return that was the beginning of Restitution & Reparation just like the Right of Return Law in former USSR began the Restitution/Reparation for the Crimean Tatars ...who grew from 2% in their homland in 1989 to 12% in 2014 until everything was undone & overturned by the return of Colonial-Imperialist Russia.\n\nSame thing happened in Israel when Ottomans opened the way for Jews to return to Israel \n\nYou want to talk about Racism? Have a look at the Racism/Anti-Semitism of many Arabs, especially \"Palestinian\" Arabs going back to the \"Palestinian\" Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Muhammad Amin Al-Husseini who was appointed by the British Imperial High Commissioner/Governor who at first helped the British maintain their Imperial Rule in Israel before later allying himself with Hitler & Mussolini.\n\nMuslim Brotherhood & it's Offshoot Hamas descending from the pen of the Reactionary Islamo-Fascist Qutb is who you ally yourself with ...seriously? Salafists, Wahhabists Jihadists & Terrorists?\n\nDecry one bunch of \"Capitalist-Imperialist-Racists\" while getting bed with another? LOL",

If you want paved roads, running water, and modern pharmaceuticals (medicinal or/and recreational) you kind of have to have higher-order organization. That IS possible through Anarchist methodologies, but it would require the overwhelming majority of the working class to be educated on how to do that and would need NUMEROUS highly successful examples to follow so that such organizing could be rolled out.\n\nI like the Maoist perspective that while revolutionary Socialism through Vanguardism is absolutely essential to breaking the neck of the Capitalist State, the only thing that keeps the resultant Vanguard from becoming just a Nouveau Bourgeois establishment via consolidation and codification of their power is the spirit of Anarchism. I think what Mao said is something along the lines of \"Anarchism is the soul of Communism.\" In other words, we should all keep Anarchist principles in mind and strive for making organization as local as possible without losing reasonable operational efficiency in production of the goods and services that make life outstanding for the mass of people.",

I could go on, you probably get the point. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, having a couple people emphasize the history and get into more fine details really changed my opinion on the USSR, not any accusations of being utopian.. \u270c\ufe0f",

I get where you're coming from, but that's a very strong word with negative connotations. No anarchist I've ever met would agree with either of those things. Which I realize isn't your point, you're talking about what you think would be necessary to achieve anarchist goals. I just happen to disagree. \n\nThe community I have personally participated in and helped foster as an anarchist is one where everyone joins willingly, and is free to leave at any time. Hell, I itch even calling it \"joining\" or \"leaving.\" We don't try to convince anyone that our way of living is better than theirs. We live the way we choose, and if people are impressed or interested by our example, they're free to our help and companionship. \n\nIn my experience, this leading by example kind of \"outreach\" works far better at getting to the hearts and minds of the politically disinterested or non-socialists. It's lovely to talk about revolution and class consciousness, but people nowadays don't have much time for talk or lengthy education. What I and my companions have done is be radically open, sincere, and hopeful. We act as if the world is already just, and that resources are abundant. We share our food, our housing, and our lives freely. People outside our community see that and find hope and solace. Even if we don't overthrow the state within our lifetime, we are actively making the world better and more egalitarian on a daily basis, and bringing in new companions all the time. The point isn't a worldwide anarchist hegemony (oxymoron, I know) but an environment where people are free to choose what they want.",

I want specifics. The lessons that MLs take from the USSR is don't do anything akin to perestroika? They don't even agree with Deng's policies in China. I don't know what lessons MLs take from the fall of the soviet union because ummm... They hate gorbachev, almost universally even though his solution, although naive, was pretty much necessary. Had Bukharin won the struggle maybe, but nobody is a bukharinist because MLs agree out of group think that the NEP was not a long term solution.\n\n>A good modern Marxist leninist tries to learn from and adapt the mistakes and strengths of the Soviet Union to modern day, location specific material conditions\n\nhold on, run it back\n\n>location specific material conditions\n\nYou mean to put a comma here? Material conditions would prove that the Washington consensus model is better for people. MLs say this but its utterly meaningless to anybody who knows what the sun feels like.\n\nThe whole soviet system was rotten to its core, because of the organization and assumption of how they ran the revolution. Because Marx and Lenin were wrong about a whole series of stuff, mostly Lenin being wrong about how you organize a socialist revolution to achieve communism. Its clear that the state socialist system will never produce it, mainly because it stagnates and then falls underneath itself from corruption and misallocation because bureaucrats at the gosplan have no benevolent interest in the rural peasants or even the industrial worker being fed. They have an interest in appeasing their higher ups in the party and they do this by showing graph go up. \n\n>To write off MLism as if they think things should be done exactly as in the past is ridiculous.\u00a0\n\nBecause MLs don't advocate for any adaption to new information. They're dogmatic. State run enterprises run and organized by an educated elite who will dictate where resources go. No ML state has been successful in overcoming this, from Ethiopia, Eritrea, North Korea, Cuba adapted and is liberalizing much to the dismay of orthodox marxists. Shit China is trying and did for a while distance itself so far from Marxism that it hardly has anything to do with it anymore. Nobody fears MLs because ya'll are dogmatic morons who believe in the inevitability of your revolution as if you didn't see what year it is. Nobody fears you because Lenin was wrong. And Marx underestimated capitalism's capacity to adapt to circumstances.\n\n>And Marxism Leninism and especially the vanguardism aspect is more about carrying out the revolution\n\nIf you think the revolution is when Lenin seized Petrograd this makes sense, but if you have a brain you understand the revolution wasn't finished until the early 1920s. And what do you know the educated elite who were meant to lead the revolution organized it so they were in charge of the allocation of resources... how amazing. Its almost like there is a material incentive for these educated elite to recreate the same power and economic structure as what occurred before, because no shit that would happen. My overarching point is that vanguardism reflects how the society will look afterwards, and that is to say, autocratic, endless bureaucracy, a recreation of state surveillance, and the removal of all independent political bodies.",

I love that any criticism of ML states you revert to whataboutism for situations I earnestly don't care to defend. I'm not an anarchist despite your assumption. I'm influenced by anarchist thinking, but I'm not an anarchist. That you think this does anything for your positive argument of centralization of the party apparatus is honestly kinda sad state of affairs for marxists.\n\n>cooperatives would hoard goods that were needed in other regions, and cooperatives would even falsify their reports on economic data to ensure they could keep as much resources as possible.\n\nI don't know what you are referencing, again I'm not going to defend the revolution in spain. But generally cooperatives would follow good economics to the benefit of their ownership... which is the prols themselves.. you know the people we are trying to help? Good economics would indicate that hoarding of say things you don't necessarily need leads to worse outcomes. Soviet economists knew this because they traded immense amounts of oil to western nations in exchange for bullion/ dollars. Cooperatives act in the same way, except instead of a state where at every turn there is a palm to grease the cooperative could determine its own production, worker self determination. And if the state comes in and acquisitions resources it encourages hoarding and lower outputs. This is what happened in the USSR with grain seizures which lowered outputs in the next series of seasons, causing famine. In china Deng realized this was folly and reversed the maoist bullshit that was occurring. Had the cooperatives been able to determine their own production instead of killing all the sparrows, following dogshit horticulture, and not been subject to seizures by the state millions wouldn't have lost their lives.\n\n>Turns out that decentralisation is actually very inefficient,\n\nYour idea of efficiency is so off base, efficiency is the output per amount of labor, having palms to grease and party officials to appease caused inefficiencies far more than decentralized cooperatives who exchange resources. The gosplan and all state run programs in the history of mankind have been inefficient. Take for instance the US defense sector, billions upon billions of regulatory capture by capitalist interest that uses tax payer money to buy new carpet and take in huge profit margins. The same occurred in the soviet system, misallocation of immense size caused economic stagnation in the 70s and 80s and meltdown in the early 90s. It did not bring about communism and it lead to one of the worst periods in economic history and the continuation of autocracy within Russia and many post soviet states.\n\nI'm also, not arguing against centralization categorically. There are times where decisions need to be made, that's called society. I'm against the centralization of all means of production, I'm against the centralization of all political power. I'm against stripping the proletariat of its capacity to make decisions in the name of a supposed revolution that causes famine and makes the prolitariat worse off. I'm against the totalizing of the state with the idealistic nonsense that a burreacrat in Moscow will have my best interest at heart. I don't trust the enlightened bureaucrats to be able to make the determination that resources are better off somewhere else instead of allowing the workers themselves make that decision. Also, your argument that these communes will just hoard resources and recreate capitalism, which is what I can you saying next, is an explicit acceptance to the belief that people seek their own self interest if they can, either in a body politic or in individual choices. I admit that's the case and it applies to the bureaucrats at the goslpan who say that we don't need more consumer goods we need more heavy industry and military might. But I'm the idealist here, not the one who believes that central authorities won't do the exact same thing you claim the communes did.",

The Mensheviks argued for broad membership whilst the Bolsheviks said no, you have to be a revolutionary with advanced class consciousness to be a member. The vanguard concept was used to refer to those workers who had developed class consciousness to the point of realising the worker vs boss oppositional nature and attaining some form of anti capitalist politics, emerging from the struggle. The distinction is important because these workers are revolutionary communist party member material that wants to be organised and cohered against capitalism and needs the party to provide this, as well as a revolutionary Marxist education. \n\nFrankly a party calling themselves vanguardist is a little strange as there\u2019s clear difference between the vanguard and the party that Lenin outlines and this just confuses things. \n\nThe vanguard exists with or without a party. It\u2019s just a recognition that some workers are more advanced in class consciousness than others and that we should clearly delineate between them. It arises because class consciousness is unevenly developed across workers - ideas don\u2019t magically change uniformly across the whole working class but rather affect certain more militant sections first. Because it unevenly develops the party must recognise this and treat workers differently depending on the level of class consciousness.",

Most people, by definition, are not members of the vanguard class and the last thing they want is another richie rich trying to convince them that they have their best interests at heart and that they are totally not going to stage a military coup and seize power at the first opportunity. I have that already with politicians. Vanguardism is worse because I get all of that and less individual agency so what do I get out of this as a worker exactly?\n\nI know there is also the brand of vanguardism where only those \"most conscious\" are the members of the vanguard class, but good luck getting those people to agree on anything. If it were that simple this thread and the millions of others like it wouldn't exist. \n\nAdditionally, how do you know you aren't experiencing false conciousness? You've kind of answered your own question in an inacurate way. If society isn't class conscious then why would they trust you? They hate your ideology because of pro-capitalist propaganda. Don't you think it's a bit arrogant to assume they are just going to turn over a new leaf and entrust their families' livelihood to some random elite academics who claim to be enlightened? It's kind of silly, even when taken at face value. This doesn't even consider that the vanguard probably doesn't actually care about the workers at all and are just using them to gain power and establish a totalitarian state focused on production (which is what we were trying to avoid in the first place). Your question amounts to \"why won't the stupids let us dominate them?? Don't they know we're much smarter than them and know what's good for them??\"",

Centralization didn't lead to the proletariat grasping state power, centralization lead to a few educated elite to dictate state power via the politburo and central committee. The prols were given a slate of names and forced to choose one, and then the supreme soviet met once a year and rubber stamped everything from the central committee Such proletarian grasping. \n\nI'm not even going to discuss your Engels quote because its just a recreation of the idealistic and religious dogmatism that was clearly wrong.",
