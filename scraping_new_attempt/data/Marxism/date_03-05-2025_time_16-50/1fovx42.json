They are parasites. And Milei's only goal was to benefit them.

When someone leases one out, I'd probably have to pay for any wear and tear that they incurred, and I'd have to pay my own salary for running the business.\n\nIf we imagine that the cost of leasing a car is $1,200 for me, am I \"hoarding my cars\" if I don't lease them out for someone only willing to pay $500? I'd literally be losing money so it's not hoarding so much as it is a reasonable decision to make if I want to keep lending cars.\n\nWith rent controls, you're setting a ceiling on price below what many landlords would ever accept because the cost of the house when it's being lived in, over a whole year, is likely higher than the rent. It's not hoarding to not be willing to sell, the same way you're not hoarding your computer if you don't sell it to someone only giving you $5. Does that make you a parasite?",

But they both have costs, and I would say someone isn't a hoarder just because they don't give you something when offered too low a price. Remember that many of these landlords only own houses because they have a mortgage (which they need to pay off) and also have to pay to maintain the house.\n\nI mean, food is also a necessity. Take a farmer with 100 bales of wheat. He can hire a truck to carry 50 bales into town for $100. That means at an absolute minimum he needs to sell each bale for $2. If for some reason the demand for trucks and the price of gas goes up such that the truck now costs $500 to hire, he needs to sell each bale for $10. But if we set a price control where a bale must still be sold for $2: is the farmer a hoarder simply because he refuses to lose money selling his wheat?? No, and he's not a vulture either for needing more money. Of course wheat is a necessity but it's simply unsustainable to expect farmers to lose money bringing their produce into town to sell.\n\nThe same applies for housing - people take it off the market if they can't cover their costs or if it's not worth it to deal with the admin.",

These are decisions that can and should be made for basic necessities (at the very least). Housing is one of them. Private property should be abolished. It enriches a few while leaving the vast majority insecure or outright on the street. There should be no incentive for private housing markets. Most landlords are corporate and leverage purchasing properties through bank loans against the properties they are renting.

But it's true, subsidies are one way to help the problems I described. The US government does subside housing to some degree, but they subsidise demand: first time home buyers get tax deductions, grants and down-payment help. I also imagine different states have different aid programs as well.\n\nIt doesn't make you a parasite to rent out a commodity at/slightly above cost. If the costs outweigh revenue, no one would supply the thing in the first place. Even if housing supply is all nationalised, the government would need to leverage other income sources, issue loans or print money to deal with the associated costs - that's what countries that have nationalised industries, like healthcare or rail transport, do.\n\nFor healthcare, I agree the US system is bad, but that's not necessarily because of privatisation. The Netherlands has a privatised healthcare system and their citizens are well cared for. I think problems with the US system are more specific and less generalisable to simply \"market-based solution.\"",

That\u2019s exactly contrary to the principles of scientific socialism.\n\nSay there\u2019s an apple bubble. Suddenly, apples cost $15 dollars a pop, so consumers call their local legislators and tell them to wrangle the apple market. Feeling the pressure, the legislators decide to constrain the maximum price of an apple to $10. Great, right? Well, not so much. That price is still absurd, and consumers are still unhappy. In order to lower the price further in a free market system, you need more apple orchards creating supply and competition to incentivize producers to cut their margins\u2014but now that you\u2019ve limited apple producers\u2019 profit margins, capitalists don\u2019t want to invest their money in apples, so capital migrates to other industries, and apple supply either stagnates or declines. This is what Marx facetiously calls \u201ccapitalist-communism\u201d in *Capital*: capital leaves low margin industries and chases high margin industries, causing the high margins to dip and the low margins to fatten, leading to a general equalization of the rate of profit. That process can\u2019t be completed if the low margin industries are permanently and irrevocably constrained to have low margins\u2014instead, nobody wants to build apple orchards at all. Hence, fixing the price of apples to $10 primarily benefits people who are already consumers of the absurd apple prices; it does not do as much to benefit people who couldn\u2019t buy apples because they were too expensive in the first place.\n\nWhat you want to do is incentivize more housing. This is difficult because of zoning regulations, limiting the number of residences in desirable places.

In a situation where the market is dictating the number of housing units built, the price of rent paid by tenants, etc., bourgeois economists typically view pricing controls on that rent as a market distortion that introduces inefficiencies into the system. Whether they are correct or not about how this functions in a market economy is debatable. They might be right. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s worth noting that in many large cities it is becoming more and more common for large commercial landlord companies to use price-fixing software that allows them to artificially raise rents, in collusion with one other, far above what a competitive market would bear under normal circumstances. Not sure if this is happening in Argentina. The few stories I\u2019ve seen about the situation with rent control in Argentina (I haven\u2019t looked at this, really) have noted that after removing rent controls, the number of available housing units shot up. In a situation with housing scarcity, it\u2019s good if there are more housing units. Do we know for sure that the cost of rent in Venezuelan cities was strongly influenced by too few housing units? In many cities lots of housing units sit vacant. It may not be a supply vs. demand issue. The market\u2014as the sum total of human economic activity\u2014is far more complicated than economists typically imagine in their economic models. Important questions to ask about the situation you cite would include the following: With the increase in the number of housing units, have rents come down (as economists would expect)? Maybe they haven\u2019t. Maybe there are just more overpriced units now. Is the removal of rent controls the only thing that happened with the rental market under Milei? Maybe some other stuff happened, too, and that other stuff might be the reason the number of available units went up. Maybe along with removing the rent controls Milei also removed some onerous regulatory requirements for new housing construction. Perhaps the removal of those requirements allowed contractors to build more. I think another poster referred to the removal of regulations requiring that rent be paid in pesos. That seems important. It\u2019s possible they could have kept the rent controls in place and still seen a substantial increase in the number of available units because the other regulatory changes.",

There's always a bigger fish and the moment they stop \"providing\" these permits, their vassals (smaller capitalists) are in trouble and will have to stop their activity, because they no longer have permits of their own to give.

In the case of Argentina, their rent control laws stipulated that landlords had to rent in Argentine Pasos. This was bad for landlords because Argentina has a huge inflation problem. Milei lifted the law, allowing landlords to rent in dollars, increasing the number of landlords renting their properties, leading to rents decreasing.\n\nOf course, none of this would be necessary if housing was decomodified.",

Rent control itself is a more complex topic than people like to pretend, and Argentina had a certain situation where all the landlords were basically just collaborating to refuse to rent out their properties because they didn't want to get stuck to prices they'd set during a very bad economy. This is basically rewarding them for that behavior, as now they can have their cake and eat it too. \n\nAs for the Marxist view on this, well, I'm just a syndicalist, so I can't really speak for them, though I don't really think landlords should exist to begin with. Shelter should be treated as a basic human right.",

In Cuba there is something like 90% homeownership and 10% public ownership. In Russia social housing reduced housing costs well below cost burden, close to 5-10% of income. From what I've read you didn't pay rent for your building but for housing services like utilities.",
