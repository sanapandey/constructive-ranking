            "body": "Comrades,\n\nThe news that Google has decided to eliminate its diversity hiring targets, following the example of other giant corporations such as Meta and Amazon, should come as no surprise. As we witness the capitalist class retract its so-called \"commitment\" to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), we must ask ourselves: What is the true nature of this commitment? What lies behind these initiatives, which we were told would bring about a more just, equal, and inclusive society?\n\nTo understand this shift in corporate policy, and indeed the entire apparatus of \"DEI\" initiatives, we must approach the matter not from the liberal framework of bourgeois \"rights\" and \"diversity,\" but through the lens of historical materialism, the method of Marxism. For the working class, it is crucial to see through the illusions created by the ruling class, who use DEI and other similar programs not to genuinely address inequality, but to perpetuate the capitalist system that thrives on exploitation, division, and inequality.\n\nLet us examine this issue in light of Marx's insight in his work On the Jewish Question, where he critiques the liberal conception of rights and freedom, and the way in which these are used as tools by the bourgeoisie to maintain their rule.\n\nThe liberal bourgeoisie, in their quest to maintain their position at the top of the capitalist hierarchy, have always sought to mask the exploitation that lies at the heart of capitalist society. For decades, they have turned to \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" initiatives to present themselves as progressive and socially responsible. These efforts, we were told, would address the historical and structural injustices that marginalized groups face in the workplace and society at large.\n\nBut, comrades, let us be clear: DEI initiatives were never about fundamentally transforming the relations of production or abolishing the exploitation of the working class. They were never about eliminating the material conditions that give rise to racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. Rather, they were about managing inequality\u2014about creating the illusion of progress without threatening the capitalist mode of production that thrives on inequality.\n\nThe capitalists may have hired from underrepresented groups and launched corporate diversity programs, but this was not done out of any genuine commitment to equality. It was done because capitalism itself requires a diverse workforce to perpetuate its own reproduction. The inclusion of marginalized groups in the labor market served the interests of capital by providing a broader pool of labor to exploit, by pacifying the demands of oppressed communities, and by creating divisions within the working class.\n\nThe diversity programs, equity initiatives, and inclusive hiring practices served to obscure the fundamental truth of capitalist exploitation. They created a situation in which workers were led to believe that progress was being made through symbolic victories, while the system of wage labor and the appropriation of surplus value by the capitalist class remained untouched. By allowing marginalized groups to gain a foothold in capitalist institutions, the ruling class ensured that capitalism appeared more inclusive, but the core relations of exploitation remained intact.\n\n1/3",

That's the meaning of the Vance vice-presidency, and the meaning of the entire cabal of SV elite showing up at inauguration.\n\nYou have to understand -- the foundations of Google's power is actually very shallow, it's entirely driven by ad revenue. When I worked there, it was well over 90% of revenue just from search and display ads.  Android, Cloud, etc. are all very shallow,\n\nThe Biden / Harris regime was relatively aggressively pursuing anti-trust/anti-monopoly cases against Google which severely threatened the basis of the company.

            "body": "Now that we see Google, Meta, Amazon, and other corporate giants scaling back their DEI efforts, we must ask ourselves why this is happening. Have the capitalists suddenly abandoned their commitment to diversity? Have they grown weary of their so-called progressive stance?\n\nNo, comrades. The answer is much simpler: the needs of capital have changed.\n\nIn times of economic crisis, when the contradictions of capitalism sharpen and the rate of profit declines, the ruling class is compelled to retrench. When profits are squeezed and markets become more volatile, capitalists prioritize their most fundamental interest: profit maximization. This means cutting costs wherever possible, and eliminating initiatives that do not directly contribute to the accumulation of capital.\n\nDiversity programs, which were always secondary to the central goal of profit-making, are among the first to be scaled back. When the system no longer requires the appearance of inclusivity to maintain social stability, when the pressure from below has lessened, or when it becomes more profitable to extract surplus value from workers without the additional cost of diversity programs, the capitalists drop the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nFurthermore, diversity initiatives, in the context of an economic crisis, are seen as unnecessary burdens on the capitalist enterprise. The capitalist class, which once saw some utility in these initiatives for stabilizing social unrest, now perceives them as dispensable. This is because the underlying contradiction of capitalism\u2014the class antagonism between capital and labor\u2014remains unresolved, and the ruling class must continually cut labor costs, maximize exploitation, and increase efficiency in order to survive the capitalist cycle of boom and bust.\n\nThe ruling class only turns to DEI programs when it benefits them materially. When the appearance of diversity helps maintain social order or provides a competitive edge in the marketplace, they are willing to entertain such initiatives. But in moments of economic contraction or political reaction, when the capitalist class faces pressure to maximize profits and shore up its control over the working class, it abandons these symbolic gestures in favor of stripping the worker bare.\n\nWhat are we to make of the rights and freedoms that the capitalist class so generously grants us? In On the Jewish Question, Marx shows us that the political rights afforded by bourgeois society\u2014freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and so on\u2014are illusions. These rights exist within the framework of civil society, which is dominated by private property, competition, and individualism. These rights do not touch the material basis of society\u2014the relations of production\u2014and therefore do not lead to true emancipation.\n\nIn the same way, the \"rights\" afforded by diversity initiatives are limited and illusory. They give marginalized groups the right to be exploited equally under capitalism, but they do not challenge the system of exploitation itself. Diversity in hiring practices may shift the composition of the workforce, but it does not abolish the capitalist relations of production. It does not change the fact that workers\u2014regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity\u2014are forced to sell their labor power to survive, while the capitalists appropriate the fruits of that labor.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion, like political rights, are forms of political emancipation, but they are not human emancipation. They may grant the worker the right to participate in capitalist exploitation without discrimination, but they do not grant the worker freedom from exploitation itself. This is the crux of the matter: liberal rights are limited to the sphere of political life, but they do not touch the economic relations that determine the real conditions of existence.\n\nTrue emancipation cannot be achieved through the expansion of diversity programs or the granting of political rights under capitalism. It can only be achieved by abolishing capitalism itself\u2014by creating a society in which the means of production are collectively owned and the exploitation of labor is ended.\n\n2/3",

We must see these programs for what they truly are: tools used by the ruling class to obscure the reality of class struggle and to divide the working class along lines of race, gender, and identity.\n\nInstead of focusing on the narrow victories afforded by DEI programs, we must focus on the broader struggle for socialist revolution. The working class, regardless of race or identity, is united by a common condition: exploitation by capital. It is only through the collective struggle of the working class\u2014against the capitalist system itself\u2014that we can achieve true emancipation.\n\nWe must reject the liberal framework of rights that seeks to pacify us with symbolic gestures. We must instead embrace the Marxist vision of human emancipation, which seeks to abolish the conditions of exploitation and alienation that keep us divided and oppressed.\n\nClass solidarity\u2014not corporate diversity programs\u2014must be our guiding principle.
