    "selftext": "I have read large sections of Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*. But I am wondering what other works to read. What are the prerequisites for reading Volume 2? I've heard that, in Volume 2, Marx is responding in detail to specific arguments from classic political economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo. So what works should I read before reading Volume 2? I am not asking for only names of authors, but rather the titles of the specific works which Marx is responding to the most. Any help is appreciated.",

Sismondi\u2019s *New Principles of Political Economy* has some important implications that Marx arguably missed for his reproduction scheme\u2014it takes a pretty attentive reader to see it, though. Ricardo is most necessary for volume one, so you\u2019re doomed already.",
