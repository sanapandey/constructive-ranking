As an English major we do a lot of interpretation of the world (really just interpretation of specific texts\u2026) and not a lot of *changing* it\u2014to paraphrase Marx. I find myself writing a Marxist analysis of Frankenstein or Paradise Lost, but feel like I\u2019m being almost sacrilegious\u2014that I\u2019m using the sublime revolutionary tool that is Marxism\u2026to talk about a book?? \nHow do I, in academia, use Marxism without stripping it of its revolutionary character?",

There's certainly consumers of literary critique out there who could potentially gain much insight that could translate into their future practices.\n\nI'm literally reading Shakespeare's Influence on Karl Marx The Shakespearean Roots of Marxism by Christian A. Smith:\n\n[https://annas-archive.org/md5/9f9475ad37bb43afe96c9e8227dec23b](https://annas-archive.org/md5/9f9475ad37bb43afe96c9e8227dec23b)",

If you need me to clarify something please let me know).\n\nNow, Literature and culture are a very important tool that is used a lot by those who have the power to dominate us and by the communists and workers to interpret reality, to advance consciousness and as a form of expression (This was something that Gramsci talked a lot about and he called it culture and counterculture). I don't think there's anything wrong with using the tools that Marxism provides us to analyze literary issues or any other kind of art and culture (Even Lenin and Stalin have many writings talking about literature and art in the service of the people)",

The point of scientific socialism is that it's replicable- i.e. the same frameworks of critical analysis that you are learning to use on works of literary art (and incredible works of art at that- the first few pages of paradise lost are utterly sublime) can then be pointed at anything. They are crucial.",

            "body": "Revolution just means change, and the aim of Marxism in literary criticism is literally to change how we view narratives and by extension the entire world. Politics are practiced as rhetoric and all rhetoric is narrative. How we talk about things influences how others think about things. There is nothing at all sacrilegious about applying Marxist principles to texts. In fact, doing so specifically counters the impulse to treat art and entertainment as throw-away distraction commodities in a capitalist system.",

            "body": "Just a few thoughts from someone who was once where you are:\n\n1. Don't sweat this too hard. If Marxism really is a big theory of how to change the whole world, then it is definitely not a personal moral system or a tool for making people feel guilty about their job/hobbies.\n\n2. But take your feeling seriously, since the tension *is* real. Marxism wasn't meant to help English and sociology professors describe stuff better and get tenure. And literary theory wasn't meant as a tool for proving the truth of Communism. Be proud of being an English major; take seriously those in your field who produced rich historical studies of literature, led debates about how people perceive texts, etc.\n\n3. This isn't to say there aren't good reasons to combine the two. But experiencing intellectual contradictions is a great way to keep yourself honest. Too many academics/writers act like their job is the magical nexus where Marxist politics and literary analysis converge and poetry interpretations will cause Communism. Think hard about why *Paradise Lost* needs Marx (if at all).\n\n4. Marx and Engels weren't really \"Marxists\" about literature. Marx loved art and read Greek tragedy with great pleasure. He doesn't appear to have done this because he felt some duty to prove tragedy was a secret analogy for the economy. When he talks about art, he mainly talks about it like everything he wrote about: labor and workers. His arts discussions are mainly about piano builders, the salary of writers, etc.\n\n5. If in the end you decide you separately like Marx and *Paradise Lost*, just be a Marxist and read books. (Funny you mention *PL*; Marx wrote about that book and was mainly focused on Milton's status as a worker, not how to interpret *PL*. See https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/add1.htm)\n\nPS: I would recommend you check out the writings of Stephan Hammel, Jarek Ervin, and Bryan Parkhurst. Just search their websites/google/academia.edu. They are all arts people who take this problem seriously. Of course, make sure you aren't just reading them or Gramsci and co. Go read Marx on politics and economics.",

There is the one letter from Engels where he says he likes Balzac better than Zola, and it is like all 20th century communist parties and academics got license to construct either the strictest rules or the most elaborate interpretive schemes where art is the key to everything. I mean I like reading Lukacs and Jameson as much as the next person, but the labor aristocracy of academics competing with each other for tenure while truly believing their research proposals that they are advancing the proletarian cause, is simply embarrassing.",

But why not use your literary experience as the creative bedrock for writing about urgent current affairs and issues important to the working class? Turn your approach upside down, so to speak, or as is often said of Marxism in regard to dialectics, turn your work from standing on its head to standing on its feet.\n\nEDIT : Marx studied philosophy, but he used his experience of philosophy and Greek myths to aid his writing about political economy and his arguments.",

As such, it is limited by its historical conditions, as all things are. However, since we can't \"see\" our historical limits, they only manifest themselves via symptoms. Literature is just one of those symptoms. Use your analysis of literature as a kind of practice to be able to read the world and understand the limits that condition both your interpretation of the text and the construction of the text in its time. It will be useful practice for you in terms of understanding future contexts of class interest and possibility.\n\nLastly, you're right. No analysis of literature is going to change the world. And the malaise you feel is justified. But Marxists are so rarely allowed to have jobs to spread marxism, so see this as an opportunity to learn. Use it.\n\nOr just read my response to this post for a related answer:https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/s/Khv9yNAEE5",

There's also plenty of that which has come out of the working class in the US. Whoever addresses the Marxist critiques tends to get the support of the people. That can be used to suppress existing class tensions and work against necessary revolution/change.",
