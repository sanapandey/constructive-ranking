If you're serious about this, you should take the initiative to start locally with a cell (or club, or whatever you're going to call single units) and build from there. If you have no experience in this, there are any number of guides on building a general-purpose civic group, and plenty of info on Red organizations. \n\nI would suggest that prior to putting the word out you sit down and write a 'manifesto' of sorts- it doesn't have to be a literary or political masterpiece, but something that brings your thoughts together on the local problems you see, what can possibly be done about them, and how a Red outfit can get these issues handled. \n\nIf there is a local branch of an established party available to you, there's no harm in giving them a visit and seeing how they do business; you might decide to hook up with them and see what's what before embarking on your own crusade. \n\nIn the end, this is your project; if you're serious about it, get out there and make it happen. I wish you success.",

                    "body": "Most of the reason is due to the lack of major parties within the nation. We have a lot of smaller scale pre-parties but nothing that can actually make a big difference. \n\nIn my opinion we need to join smaller parties together into a larger more cohesive unit able to host, fund, and organize strikes instead of doing whatever it is the CPUSA and DSA do these days. \n\nAnother reason is I think it will help deep red states out by giving them a chance at locating and getting together with other Marxists and begin local party branches. As someone in a deep red state (MS) i don\u2019t have the option to join another party since there are none. And the threat on my life would be high if i attempted to go at it with a small number of members. \n\nThanks for the insight!",
