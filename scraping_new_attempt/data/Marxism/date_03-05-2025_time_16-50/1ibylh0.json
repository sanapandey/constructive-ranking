    "selftext": "I just saw a comment from someone saying that they have been communist for the past several decades and there was basically no option to organize until the 2008 recession because people (US) were so placated. And how stagnant they felt during that time. \n\nI saw another comment in r/JewsOfConscience which was from someone who was anti- Zionist for 40 years in Israel. They said they had to keep their beliefs a secret and it was draining to not be able to speak genuinely with their family and friends. \n\nTimes are rough right now but I\u2019m grateful that so many people are willing to observe what\u2019s really happening instead of denying it. And I\u2019m grateful that we have so many present examples of people who are doing what\u2019s necessary to become free. It feels like a fresh breath of air. I\u2019ve been communist for 7 years and only recently am I seeing more people open up to non- reformist points of view. The next few decades are going to be tough but people are amazing and I am always surprised by what we are capable of. ",

This is in sleepy little Britain, the place where \"we don't do revolution\" (except when the English bourgeoisie beheaded their king a century and a half before the French did, but we're made to forget that awkward detail). \n\nThese people aren't necessarily right wing, or necessarily want a dictatorship. They just, rightly, hate the system and want to see it torn down, as they know it does not work for them or anyone else except a rich elite.\n\nAs the Revolutionary Communist International are fond of saying, which I think is a brilliant but accurate phrase, these layers of radicalised workers and youth \"are products of history\".\n\nThey are a reflection of a system which has outlived its historical role and is in decline, and millions of people, particularly young people, feel that.\n\nHere's to the products of history! I truly believe Gen Z and the generation after will be the generations which make the social revolution happen.",

I\u2019m famous!\n\nYeah things suck now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2026 but class struggle options are more possible than in the past and there is at least more open class resentment if still no real class consciousness.\n\nIf you tried to talk to someone about organizing fast food workers or creating a tenants union in 2005, you might as well be saying:  \u201chey let\u2019s just start a worker\u2019s committee and take over our workplace\u201d and people would look at you like you were from the moon.\n\nAs a middle aged leftists\u2026 I am happy to be in a time where there is a chance of class organizing and possibly a revival of labor and a working-class focused socialism - I have mixed feelings about being overall correct about broader things like neoliberalism and Zionism after years and years of people telling me I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about.",

But at least people are starting to see the alternatives to kneeling to the current powers.",

There is a tremendous amount of confusion, na\u00efvet\u00e9 and wishful thinking. \n\n- Will the spontaneously emerging forms of class consciousness be enough or are they affected by bourgeois consciousness?\n- Does an international, socialist and anti-war have to be built that introduces socialist consciousness into the working class?\n- Do we need to patiently, persistently and systematically explain (including to ourselves) the objective roots of the crisis?\n- Is the working class still threatened by betrayal from opportunism by groups claiming to be its representatives?\n\u2014\n\nFWIW:\n\u2026 society actually takes the institutions which hang upon it as given once for all. For decades the oppositional criticism is nothing more than a safety valve for mass dissatisfaction, a condition of the stability of the social structure. Such in principle, for example, was the significance acquired by the social-democratic criticism. Entirely exceptional conditions, independent of the will of persons and parties, are necessary in order to tear off from discontent the fetters of conservatism, and bring the masses to insurrection.\n\nThe swift changes of mass views and moods in an epoch of revolution thus derive, not from the flexibility and mobility of man\u2019s mind, but just the opposite, from its deep conservatism. The chronic lag of ideas and relations behind new objective conditions, right up to the moment when the latter crash over people in the form of a catastrophe, is what creates in a period of revolution that leaping movement of ideas and passions which seems to the police mind a mere result of the activities of \u201cdemagogues.\u201d\n\nThe History of the Russian Revolution (Trotsky, 1930y\n\nVolume One: The Overthrow of Tzarism\nPreface\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch00.htm",
