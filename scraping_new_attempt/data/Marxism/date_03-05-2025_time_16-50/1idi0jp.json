They are an unproductive cost that the state judges to be necessary for its purposes.\n\nThe value of a soldier as in, the amount of salary tbey receive, then depends on whatever the state finds necessary to guarantee the soldiers loyalty and obedience. Usually, the calculation of a person enlisting as a soldier is that they will be sonewhat better off financially then when they had to compete on the labor marker, so the value is indirectly determined by the labor market. The benefit they seek might be a salary that is slightly higher, or the security of being employed for a certain time while living expenses are covered.",

That\u2019s surplus value because the resources they facilitate the extraction of is of more value than their cost. I\u2019m just theorizing tho",

Ruthless gives a great explanation, but basically: in case like this, states aren\u2019t capitalists paying workers to make commodities that they then sell. The soldier is paid out of state revenue (e.g., taxes) to do a service for the state.",

In a truly communist society, we would not try to calculate the specific value of the soldier's labor, we would try to distribute resources according to the soldier's needs. In a transitional, socialist society, we might try to calculate the relative contribution of the soldier's work to the overall value of society and pay them accordingly, but that would be a kind of arbitrary process that exists only to \"bridge the gap\" from capitalist production to communism",

They get social welfare benefits from the government instead. But their labor value is \u201cgrunt\u201d it\u2019s just general labor.\n\nBut idk, are soliders considered a real separate class? There are class divisions from overall society within the military - as much as they pretend there isn\u2019t and so the class consiousness of a solider from regular life is going to translate.\n\nFor a worker\u2019s army, pay is less the main thing than inverting military hierarchy as much as possible (like tactical coordination or whatever might require a specific agreed to order of command in combat\u2026 but planning and so on can be done as a militia, anything like officers can be elected and replaceable without fragging. \n\nEven in capitalism soldiers are not being exploited for their labor value\u2026 they are being used as well soldiers - as an armed force. But in armies to defend ruling classes and empire, lack of autonomy for soldiers is not on an emergency basis for combat, it\u2019s the norm. Conscription was the norm, people being taken for long stretches of their life was the norm. The US incentivizes enlistment now and sells it as a personal way to advance yourself, but conscription could return anytime they need it. So for worker\u2019s militias in a revolution the difference would be soldiers would not be pawns and would have the ability to refuse, people would be motivated to fight for to protect their own power.",

Not to mention, military actually has divisions and hierarchy. Considering that, we find that often the officer rank people and their families actually gain some benefits. Here in India, for example, there's a Defence Quota which is reservation of some seats in central Universities (most) for children of armed forces personnel and there are also army schools which provide education to children of military personnel but typically also aim to recruit more people into the army itself. \n\nI don't think we can separate military, etc from being an extension of State. Ultimately, the recruitment in these services will have to do with nationalist interest and ideological inclination, in addition to a need to obtain some perks of being in army. As somebody else also mentioned here, that maybe of the compulsion can be removed then the recruitment in army would be more interest based but of course, for now army, military, etc won't cease to exist so their characteristics will very likely carry forward into Socialism as well with some differences.",

By necessity, the revolution must be international, and an international revolution would largely abolish the need for soldiers.\n\nIt could be said that the \"protection\" which is offered by capitalist militaries contributes to all production within a specified state in one small way or another, but really, there is no direct contribution to the society.\n\nEssentially, soldiers during the revolution will be paid whatever they need to be paid to bring an end to the revolution through victory. After this, they become superfluous.\n\nThis is just my interpretation based on what I have read, if anyone can correct me I will be glad to learn more.",

The ideal way is it's invested into social production; healthcare, housing &c. The way it went during the great depression is it was hoarded and the whole system simply collapsed in on itself. The third way, as we've seen time and time again in the 20th century is that the surplus value goes towards military spending with the goal of opening up new markets such that said value can become capital once more.\n\nThe labour of soldiers does not produce value except through the soldiers military actions which perform the goal of opening up markets, enabling extracted surplus value to become capital once again. Otherwise their salaries are simply an expenditure, a hole to throw money into.\n\nTo your question of exploitation of a soldier in a socialist state; Exploitation under Marxism is surplus value being extracted from the labourer. Given that the soldier does not create surplus value for the capitalist (at least not directly, and only through several generation defining wars), a soldier cannot be exploited under socialism, or indeed even under capitalism.",

Considering that in the event of a revoloution it is soldiers who are expected to put down the revoloutionary vanguard- it makes their value in the capatalist system essentially priceless (which is why in times of war they are essentially allowed to do whatever they want- looting, rape etc. etc.- their loyalty, and willingness to defend the interests of capital is essential).  \n\nregarding the soldier under socialism- militaries are actually pretty easy to socialize because they are usually somewhat socialised to begin with. which is to say that in the hopeful case of capturing a state intact- the military is the largest and most powerful organ that is entirely controlled by the state. In the October revoloution, The Bolsheviks were able to count on the Kronstadt sailors and then the Latvian rifle regiment. These were pre-existing military structures. \n\nThe bolshevik answer to your question of exploitation was the commisar system. Essentially the commisars were entrusted with instructing the soldiers in class consciousness. That was their fundamental purpose. The Bolsheviks did try to implement various new formations of military command- but ultimately returned to a less brutal version of the Tsarist command structure- that was meritocratic (And absoloutely less brutal- after the February revoloution, the tsarist officers were outraged when the Kerensky government forbade officers from punching their men in the face)-likely due to the relaities of fighting a civil war. \n\nSoldiers in a socialist state are only necesarry as long as non-socialist states exist, and the danger they present. \n\nConscription rather than volunteering is likely the best soloution- since it's a socialised duty. It's not a great idea to get people to volunteer for the military (it's not something you really want people to do as a passion).",
