    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about how capital accumulation seems to be an inevitable force, even in socialist or communist systems. For example, the USSR industrialized rapidly, catching up to the West in just a few decades, despite starting from a point of underdevelopment similar to Porfirian Mexico. In practice, socialist systems often function as state capitalism, with the state acting as the primary accumulator and distributor of capital.  \n\nIn practice, socialist systems often resemble state capitalism, with the state accumulating and distributing capital, ostensibly to eventually hand control over to the people (as Lenin theorized). Even in cases of failed socialism, like Chile, the level of capital accumulation often exceeds that of comparable non-revolutionary countries, such as the Dominican Republic.  \n\nSo, are communist revolutions essentially a violent release of 'bottled-up capital,' breaking through oppressive structures to accelerate development in regions held back by imperialism or feudalism? Or is there more to it than that?\n\nPsa. Not a seasoned Marxist but I had this \u201cepiphany?\u201d While reading about Left-Accelerationism. I want to hear your thoughts and critiques :) ",

            "body": "First of all, in Marxist terms \"capital\" isn't simply physical wealth or industry. It's a social relation based on wage labour and private ownership of the means of production. \n\nIn a socialist system, wealth accumulation does not automatically mean the existence of capital in the Marxist sense, because surplus value is not being extracted for private profit. Instead, state-directed accumulation in socialist economies is designed to be geared towards social needs rather than profit maximalisation. This is why many Marxists reject the term 'State capitalism,' as it implies that the socialist state still operates under the same logic of capital accumulation for private profit rather than social needs.\n\nSecondly, I don't necessarily agree with the framing that revolutions are \"a violent release of bottled-up capital\", because it implies their primary function is to increase economic development. Revolutions are bloody, disasterous events which often degrade into long, protracted struggles for survival, and in almost all cases ends up destroying a large proportion of a nation's economic potential for generations. Whether it's human potential lost to war, famines, destruction of industry, etc. While I agree that economic conditions are absolutely important in sparking revolutions, they are instead struggles for power and influence where no other option can be found! Revolutions are about changing the relations of production and abolishing class exploitation. They also tend to happen when the outgoing class tries to hold onto their power at all costs, and loses the protracted struggle against a more popular and more dedicated opposition. Of course the nature of capitalism is that it does not uniformly industrialise everywhere at once, as industry will only go where there are markets and profits to be found, but it also doesn't mean that other nations are unable to industrialise with enough state-support under a capitalist system too.  Even if the October Revolution had not succeeded, Russia likely would have continued industrialising, as it had already begun doing before WWI under Tsarist reforms and later under Kerensky\u2019s February Revolution, albeit at a slower pace.  \n  \nPart of the reason state directed intervention was so successful in the USSR in the first 5-year plans, was because it was also their first true years of peace and economic stability since their 1917 revolution. During the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922), much of the country\u2019s productive capacity was either repurposed for war efforts, destroyed in conflict, or rendered ineffective due to the breakdown of supply chains and mass displacement of workers. The subsequent period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) (1921\u20131928) was essentially a strategic retreat, allowing for a partial reintroduction of market mechanisms to stabilise the economy before the Soviet leadership under Stalin moved toward centralised planning. The First Five-Year Plan (1928\u20131932) marked the beginning of a massive state-directed push toward industrialisation and collectivisation, which, despite its human cost, did succeed in rapidly transforming the Soviet Union into a modernised industrial power as you mentioned. However, this must be viewed in the context of growing anti-communist sentiment in the 1920s and 30s, as well as the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and the rise of fascist powers. Stalin saw industrialisation as a race against time, fearing that without rapid modernization, the USSR would be too weak to resist the impending future invasions. \n\nHope this helped :)",

Instead, state-directed accumulation in socialist economies is designed to be geared towards social needs rather than profit maximalisation.\n\nYou know, even mainstream economists share a view similar to this (that production for social needs is more beneficial for everyone than profit maximization), although they say it in a different way: it's more rational to invest in risky projects that can potentially generate greater net benefits in the long run than to pursue short-term profit maximization, and since private capitalists are only interested in the latter and not in the former, the government should step in by taxing the capitalists' profits and using the tax revenue to do the former.\n\nOf course, their \"social democratic\" proposal still leaves a massive chunk of surplus value in the hands of capitalists, who use them for profit maximization and not towards socially beneficial ends. Not to mention the fact that the capitalist class still exists and can exert influence on the government so that their tax burden decreases. On the other hand, in socialism, there exists no capitalist class and all surplus value is democratically managed by the government so profit maximization is fully eliminated, and that is one of the many reasons why socialism is superior to social democracy.",

Sometimes the purposes of the capitalist align with the people - most of the times that's in underdeveloped countries, capitalists want infrastructure, education, to have better workers, faster transportation, a stable power source etc, which is the reason why capitalism can be portrayed as a bootstrap of poor countries - it benefits and the people, and the capitalist. You could say \"we could do this on our own\", but China/Dengism in general understood that most of the times, the initial capital needs to be foreign investments (in some underdeveloped countries), and most countries that are now developed, developed by exploiting the \"3rd world\" for cheap resources/slavery, something a socialist state definitely wouldn't want to do.\n\nThe examination of the capital relation is not only one of \"if this benefits the people\", because that is a condition observed in capitalist societies. It is a question mostly of political control.",

Historically, colonizers have used their subject lands for resource extraction, which of itself means they have little incentive to create production within their colonies outside those that benefit the practice of resource extraction. By pushing industrialization, communist and socialist systems achieve beneficial results on many fronts at once - they can better meet the needs for production their societies have, they strengthen their ability to resist the Trojan horses of outside markets attempting to coerce power away from the leaders of the country through embargos or exploitative trade, they pave the way toward creating urban developments which are the lifeblood of societal development, and they help to provide purpose for citizens to contribute to the collective. People\u2019s labor inherently creates capital, capital is not an inherently evil or dangerous thing, and the fact the fruits of labor create capital is why it\u2019s important that the means of production are allowed to be controlled by the workers. Labor done efficiently will create capital, from there the distribution and value that capital has to the society is what truly shapes the world they build.",
