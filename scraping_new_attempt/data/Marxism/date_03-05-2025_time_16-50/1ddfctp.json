    "selftext": "I'm a socialist and a member of a trotskyist faction trying to build a new mass working class party. That currently exists as TUSC. It is far from perfect, and there are many other factions, not least of all George Galloway's electoral party. None of them stand a chance of winning power and the less said about GG the better.\n\nIt seems to me that, like it or not, the best prospect is to put the Labour party into power. Currently that appears a given with their poll lead and the absolute collapse of the ruling Tory party. \n\nI do not like the Labour party, not least of all because it is not socialist. It has been taken over by a centre right faction bent on purging the left. Pushback will be difficult but not impossible. I do not see any alternative. THings are so bad that the Tories, as an absolute bottom line demand, must be removed from power. I don't think any change is possible otherwise. What Labour offer will be mild reforms at best, and failure at worst, whcih could open the door to a resurgent far right Tory party. It will be vital to hold Labour to account and push them hard.\n\nWhat are the alternatives? I fully accept my analysis may be wrong and so I'm happy to be correct, in comradely fashion. Thanks",

If they did have any say in the electoral result then they should use that influence to demarcate independent socialist politics. This seems to be basically a lesser evilism argument that has been getting labour parties across the world elected for 100 years. There is no solution other than a socialist one and approaching the problem from a standpoint of avoiding the tyranny of the right by electing right-moderates is going to be a feature every single election which has the conservative right as a participant. An advancement in building class struggle and socialism is far better than paltry reform from a Labour Party rule.",

We are very far from any such thing, which is why building a new party is important",

                    "body": "Just on the entryism within Labour point- it has pretty much become impossible. Arguably it became impossible in the late 80s/early 90s after Militant. \n\nThere are two reasons for this. Firstly, the class base of Labour has changed. It is much less a working-class party (although ofc still much more so than the Tories). Yes, it still has connections with the unions, and yes there are still large numbers of the working-class who are supporters or member, but overall the party has become an even more brazen servant of bourgeois interests, to the point of not even hiding it. The complete disregard the current leadership and bureaucracy show to even the most right wing of union leaders is evidence of this. The decline in membership and active participation, the lack of engagement from the workers. This means one of, if not the, key ain of entryism, that of pushing for more radical, socialist programmes within a party of a mass-working class nature is pretty much impossible.\n\nThe second reason is purely one of practicality. Labour tried to purge the Left as best as they could in the 90s, but after Corbyn, the leadership has gone completely all in. Even moderately left-wing views or criticisms of party leadership can be enough to get you banned or expelled. This means any large scale organising of radical left groups within Labour is entirely impossible. There are perhaps individual left wing members and supporters of the party who can be engaged with on an individual basis, but both the base of the party and the possibilities available have significantly changed.\n\nThis is ofc a huge problem for the Left. The left seems paralysed in the face of this atm. People are flip-flopping between backing the Greens or Lib dems or arguing for lesser evilism. It is particularly a problem for Marxists given that the two major UK-wide parties that are left of Labour (yes, I am including Lib Dems, not advocating a vote for them though) are generally based in the petite bourgeoisie and outright bourgeoisie. The British left really needs to face up to the task of rebuilding the instruments of class-struggle and class-consciousness or we are finished.",
