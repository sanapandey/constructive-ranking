    "selftext": "I'm reading \"what's to be done\" by Lenin. From the first pages I get the notion that communists are separate from socialdemocrats. \n\nIn my mind\u00b4s eye, I see the political spectrum chart with the authoritarian/libertarian Y axis and Right/Left X axis. The authoritarian/Right would be the fascists, the autoritarian/Left would be the communists, the libertarian/Right would be the liberals and the libertarian/Left would be the Anarchists.  After reading the Manifesto I'm under the impression that democracy has its limits, and to further *true* Liberty, Equality and Fraternity the goal is to, as China does, get a \"people\u00b4s *democratic dictatorship*\", hence communism has to have a degree of authoritarianship to prevent the other groups undermining or reversing the revolution. ^((Sidenote: in my mind, democratic and dictatorship are opposites, so to my current understanding) *^(democratic dictatorship)* ^(is a contradiction).) \n\nWell, reading WTBD I understand that socialdemocrats, using freedom of criticism, fight or oppose hardline communism. So they have a more libertarian disposition, hence in the political spectrum chart they'd be in Anarchy's cuadrant (libertarian/Left). \n\nBut now, in chapter 2, about spontaneity of the masses, it seems that socialdemocracy is a step in an evolutionary path. It says:\n\n>The revolts were simply the resistance of the oppressed, whereas the systematic strikes represented the class struggle in embryo, but only in embryo. Taken by themselves, **these strikes were simply trade union struggles, not yet Social Democratic struggles**. They marked the awakening antagonisms between workers and employers\n\nShouldn't it say \"these were not yet *communist* struggles\"? \n\nIt feels like socialdemocracy is a step, and if one \"trust the process\" and follow the natural path of socialdemocracy one will find hardline communism. Is that correct?",

Our goal is not to eliminate democracy but rather to expand it to the economy as well as the state and to place it in the hands of the proletariat.\n\nThe dictatorship we refer to is not a personal dictatorship, it's a class dictatorship. We want the whole proletarian class to dictate our will over the bourgeois class in a dictatorship of the proletariat. Currently we have a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.",

It means democratic centralism, which is democracy in a classless society (modern democracy is not classless due to capitalism).\n\nSecond thing is that you view politics through the political compass. That's literally one of the worst ways to understand politics possible. There's tons of nuance that's missing when you view things like that. It's like trying to explain art or music with XY graphs, it's impossible to do it without missing things.\n\nAnd the thing about the social democratic part is that you need to realize that Lenin wasnt talking about what we today understand as \"social democratic movements\". In this pamphlet's context, the term \"social democracy\" just describes socialism, including moderate movements as well as communists. At this point, the concept of communism as its own movement didn't really exist yet. At this point, he considered what we would consider as \"communism\" to be true socialism and social democracy.",

No valuable discussion can be made when it's even considered a valid element because it perpetuates a fundamentally wrong view of politics and ideology. \n\nAnd no, the idea of communists being hardliners and socialists being moderates is another gross simplification that only perpetuates the idea that communism is extreme while socialism is the more sensible option (the connotations matter a lot).\n\nWhen talking about socioeconomic systems, socialism can be considered a precursor to communism. Communism can be seen as the idealized classless society, while socialism is the transitionary system between it. Marx had a very particular perspective of what communism is, and no nation to date has ever achieved it (this is why communists sometimes say the USSR, China and Cuba are/were technically not communist nations)\n\nWhen talking about ideology, socialism is generally a catch all term that includes communism. Marxists are socialists first and only considered communists if they buy into the idea of proletariat revolution and the formation of a system whereby workers own the means of production (basically working to achieve Marx's idealized communist society).\n\nBy labeling them as hardline and moderate, it ignores the nuance that Marxists may call themselves both socialists and communists, just like how Lenin and Marx did. It's like trying to say free market capitalism is hardline while neoliberalism is moderate, it doesn't work like that.",

We had a proxy war during the 80s. Eventually we had a Peace Accord and a Left party was born, the FMLN, and a bipolar system was put in place. The Right party, ARENA, was in power for some 20 consecutive years (4 presidential terms) until a FMLN candidate won the presidency and we joined the latinamerican \"21rst century socialism\". The FMLN kept power for 2 consecutive terms, 10 years, until a \"transversal\" alt-right-opportunistically-left dictator took power by democratic means 6 years ago. Since then, like all alt-right dictators he has annihilated the Left (where he came from, mind you, since he began his career in the FMLN) and rules the land with the good will of the Right.\n\n\nI'm telling you this because I want to understand this \"21rst century socialism\". Around 2010 a lot of latinamerican and even european nations turned Left. But now, 15 years later, the world is filled to the brim with the alt- right everywhere. Why?\n\n\nIn my mind, the 21rst century socialism tried to compromise with Capitalism. They were unwilling to shake the Status Quo. The working class that put the Left in leadership roles expected more, and dissolutioned they turned to fascism in the hopes of getting somewhere to their demands (actual change, better life conditions). These people were elected to be Revolutionaries, but ended up becoming Liberals. So, I thought, socialism is guilty of being lukewarm and only Communism was radical (hardliner) enough to actually challenge the consensus and make real change. \n\n\nBut from your feedback, socialism is the umbrella term for all Left. Revolutionary socialism is the actual goal of this age, and the 21rst century socialism was Liberalism with extra steps, correct?",

I don't know much about El Salvadorian politics other than the fact hat the recent President became famous for his anti-gang crackdowns and weird crypto obsession. I've heard that he's fairly popular for the crackdowns, but his authoritarianism was alarming.\n\nAbout 21st century socialism, that term is a little open to interpretation. The idea is that it's trying to take the lessons of failed 20th century socialism and reformulate a new type of socialism that is supposedly better and superior to past attempts. It primarily supports the idea of gradualism, essentially making change via participation in electoral politics and on a step by step basis.\n\nIt's apparently quite popular in Latin America but it's really hard to say what it actually entails because the proponents have different ideas of what application looks like. The problem is that it's vague, all it says is that it's anti-neoliberal but not much else. It's socialist, in that it rejects free market capitalism and supports nationalization and wealth redistribution, but that's about it.\n\nTbh, I wouldn't pass judgement on the topic since I'm no expert. But afaik, the goals of 21st century socialism is quite vague so it's hard to know if it's trying to get to a revolution or not.",

            "body": "What Lenin is talking about in that passage is how revolutionary consciousness comes about. \n\nLenin always argued against economism which only focused on economic or trade unionist struggles. He argued that just struggling for better economic conditions was not enough for the working class to gain revolutionary (or social democratic) consciousness. In the same way the fight for women's rights and other \"democratic\" struggles also did not lead to revolutionary consciousness.\n\nProviding this consciousness was he believed the role of the social democrats (a.k.a. communists). We have to be immersed in these economic and democratic struggles and bring our Marxist analysis and vision which will lead these movements towards revolution. That is what being the vanguard is about for Lenin. The communists being the vanguard does not mean a small number of people win a revolution and stamp it on everyone else. It means the way to build a revolutionary movement is to get involved in these daily struggles, in these fights for freedom, democracy, and better economic conditions, and sway the masses toward revolution.\n\nAnd this was more pertinent at the time because revolutionary theory was not widespread and most people could not read or were not well read. Lenin argued for a disciplined party of fulltime revolutionary organizers who would do this work (like salts organizing unions).\n\nToday, the concept of the vanguard was reinterpreted to apply to modern conditions and the American working class by Gus Hall who coined the term \"communist plus.\" You can read about it here: [Why we\u2019re bringing back \u201cthe plus\u201d \u2013 Communist Party USA](https://www.cpusa.org/article/why-were-bringing-back-the-plus/)\n\nLenin also argued that winning democratic reforms was of utmost importance. Only through winning those reforms could we build a movement for socialism. And he also argued that the working class (and the communists) should lead the way in winning a complete bourgeois revolution. Leftists today tend to dismiss liberalism and reforms within it as crumbs thrown to us by the oligarchy and not worth defending but what Lenin was correctly arguing at the time was that bourgeoisie did not want a complete bourgeois revolution. They were happy to win some reforms under the Czar that gave them more autonomy but they would always stop short of actually giving those same political freedoms to the working class which liberalism and capitalism promised. And we have seen through history that not only was Lenin right in the early 20th century but throughout the 20th century it was the communists and socialists who led the way in winning working class gains under capitalism. We can't dismiss those gains, we have to protect them and build on them. \n\nThe social democrats today are not necessarily our enemies. We tend to focus too much on liberals and progressives for not being radical enough or revolutionary enough, but in our current political climate, they are our allies on most issues. Under Trump, we have to form broad coalitions in order to defeat his agenda of mass deportations and gutting democratic elements of the government (welfare, regulations, nlrb, etc.). \n\nThe four quadrant political compass is not very accurate. Communists and Marxists are not \"authoritarian\" in any way. This is based on a misconception of Lenin and the Russian revolution. In fact, in What is to be Done, Lenin emphasizes the need for democracy. The movement for communism is a democratic mass movement. It can't be done any other way. Lenin always emphasized that the \\*working class\\* not the communists need to be leading the struggle. We are not the main characters.\n\nThe social democrats today are simply people who don't see beyond the need for reform under capitalism. Which is fine, we can work with them to win reforms.",

At the time, the larger faction of the Russian SocDem Labor Party (the Mensheviks) held that the proletariat would become class-conscious on its own through confrontation and/or engagement with the bourgeoisie. It was on the strength of this paper that the Party later split and the rest is history. It should be read an understood in that context, and not jut as a general 'how to do a revolution' instruction manual.

I'm a receptionist/HR guy and I've personally witnessed the monstruosities of capitalism done to my fellow 'unskilled' coworkers. And my college friends are economists, one is a bank manager and the other is a risk management overseer or something: liberals as hell. Us three received a rigurous education, from school to college: we are academic bourgoise. \n\n\nSo everytime in our get-togethers I'm the amateur leftie and they're the professional liberals. And everytime I get an inch of advantage they pull the political spectrum chart and point over and over again that communism is authoritarian. They bring up the gulags, the iron courtain, east berliners fleeing, the fall of the USRR and stuff. \n\n\nSo I decided to read (I relied on leftist material from Youtube). And when I read the Communist Manifesto Marx himself said (or at least what I understood) democracy has its limits: any victory made by the Left can be easily halted, savotaged or reversed by the Right. And I thought, as evidence there is the OG french revolution, reversed by Napoleon, the haitian revolution, savotaged by France and the german communist movement, eroded by nazis. So, I understood, communists are to seize the means of production *by any means necesary* to finally get things done. And then my friends' voices popped up in my head like, *aaaaauthooooritaaaaarian!*  \n\n\nBut, I think and like Marx said, slaveowners would never let slaves go through democratic means: no Justice has ever been achieved appealing to the moral sense of a wrongdoer. And if some strenght is necessary, so be it. And if for this shaking of the status quo someone cries \"tyranny! authoritarianism!\", that'd be fine. \n\n\nMaybe the political spectrum chart needs a Z axis: Hierarchy vs Equality. Or maybe make a new chart based on Hierarchy vs Equality in X and Welfare vs Industry on Y. Hierarchy/Welfare: theocracy. Hierarchy/Industry: imperialism. Equality/Welfare: communism. Equality/Industry: keynesianism.",

The current axes for example presuppose a sort of continuum that implies the ability for gradual change on an uninterrupted axis.\n\nI think the notions of *\"class in itself\"* and *\"class for itself\"* established by Marx can help illustrate my point that for the ability to fundamentally transform the world, one doesn't need to rely on purely idealistic prescriptivism (like in the case of the political compass) but in terms of class character, class interests, class consciousness and the relative strength of classes. \n\nI think your experience as a worker has led you to develop an intuitive class consciousness, and I probably don't need so much elaboration to convince you. However, thinking of your economist friends, if you want to delve on the topic of how members of a class can act against their specific interests under certain conditions, you could give Marx's *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon* a read.\n\nOn the topic of liberal economists, or economists in general, I want to say that I don't consider them to be serious academics. Their job is the same as that of theologians of the past: they begin from the foregone conclusion of current human relations as transcendental and proceed to give justifications from it. That's not scientific in the slightest, and that's reinforced by their love of one-sided concepts or vicious abstractions, paired with the ham-fisted attempts at mathematising everything to give it the veneer of indisputable fact. As someone with a natural science background, I've never seen people as obsessed with arbitrary applications of statistics as economists (or psychologists) are. No numbers can mask their theoretical shortcomings, ideological bias or their willingness to be selective with facts.\n\nOn a different note, going back to equality, communists and Marxists oppose equality, actually, for it can only be applied one-sided, and whatever lens you pick to apply it, I can pick another to refuse it. Karl Marx said it best in his *\"Critique of the Gotha Programme\"*:\n\n>But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only \u2013 for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.",

After all the feedback I've received from WITBD, I think it'd be wiser to leave it for the end of my journey and rather read something else.\n\nAnd yes, I concluded long ago my friends are priests of the capitalist religion, and their zeal keeps them from the truth. I've told them, you should *see* and recognize the system is wrong just for the sake of our intelectual integrity: I do know we are powerless to stop it but you should at least recognize the C word (capitalism) is a problem. But they pull statistics the modern world is so much better than the past, we excel at every metric, we are healthier, free-ier and more peaceful than ever. That's when I pull how many people has been hurt by the CIA's pro-imperialism program and it goes on an on...\n\n\nThank you for the 18th and Gotha program, I gotta read those.",
