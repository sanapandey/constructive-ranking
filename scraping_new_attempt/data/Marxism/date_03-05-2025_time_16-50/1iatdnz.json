    "selftext": "Although their main focus is on incompatibility of Marx and Nietzsche, contains criticisms and claimed contradictions in Marxism as well.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1i61yrn/marxism\\_is\\_not\\_compatible\\_with\\_nietzsche/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1i61yrn/marxism_is_not_compatible_with_nietzsche/)\n\nMarxism is not Compatible With Nietzsche\n\nI\u2019ve always considered myself right-wing, even before I read and generally adopted the philosophical positions of Nietzsche. With Nietzsche I had slowly developed a more refined \"right-wing\" view that is probably closest to the conservative revolutionaries in Germany (re: Schmitt, Junger, Heidegger). But recently I\u2019ve been taking a University class on Marxism, and delved a bit into its history, and have come to the conclusion it is wholly antithetical to Nietzsche.\n\nI only write this post because I see many leftists on this sub who have made some arguments that they are at the very least reconcilable, with some people online going so far as to argue them as working perfectly together (Jonas Ceika comes to mind). I want to address how I think this is wrong and demonstrate that Marx is antithetical to Nietzsche (I'm not going to engage in any positive political assertions, I can make an additional post about that, but this sub seems to agree that Nietzsche is pro-Aristocracy, in the classical sense).\n\nThe first major reason why Marx is antithetical to Nietzsche is dialectics. To oversimplify (and we\u2019re only speaking of Marx here, don\u2019t even get me started on Hegel lol) Marx sees the progression of history as a series of class struggles that have evolved in an ordered or \u201crational\u201d way. His main goal, then, is the description of this process, and the prediction of where it will lead. This \u201crational basis\u201d, aka the dialectic itself, is both a) contradictory with the following idea, and b) extremely against Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThe second issue is that Marxism contradicts himself (something my professor fully admitted when I asked him this in class). Referring to a), the dialectic, which is a rational progression of history, supposedly plays out through material circumstances. What that means is that as opposed to Hegel\u2019s historical idealism where the dialectic (insofar as it is present in Hegel, which is highly debatable) plays itself out through immanent self-negation of ideals, Marx thinks it is groups of people negating each other\u2019s material circumstances. These material circumstances shape our ideals, and it\u2019s only in the internal contradictions of these material conditions that we get change to the next level on the eschatology.\n\nThe reason this is contradictory is the following: if the dialectic is rational, then according to materialism it is subordinate to material conditions. But if it is subordinate to material conditions, then the dialectic could change, and isn\u2019t consistent across material conditions (as they would change it). Yet Marx maintains that the dialectic is consistent throughout history, and is not only exempt from material conditions, but actually controls them. So a rational process somehow governs material conditions, even though material conditions are supposed to govern rational ideals.\n\nThis internal contradiction aside, it also violates Nietzsche for the same reason Hegel does: it is the projection of a rational and ordered universe by the individual. Any and all metaphysical speculation, at least through my reading of Nietzsche, is motivated by the inability to live in nihilism. Therefore, Marx and Marxists feel the need to justify their existence through objective means, and engage in this rationalization of the irrational to do so.\n\nWe see this most manifest in that, even with Marx\u2019s denial of moralization, his follower Lenin still falls into this same exact trap: \"Not freedom for all, not equality for all, but a fight against the oppressors and exploiters, the abolition of every possibilityof oppression and exploitation-that is our slogan! Freedom and equality for the oppressed sex! Freedom and equality for the workers, for the toiling peasants! A fight against the oppressors, a fight against the capitalists, a fight against the profiteering kulaks!\"\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we can read Marx as a Nietzschean, and dissect his argument that he\u2019s not moralizing to be a denial of what he\u2019s really doing. Marx is committed to the idea that once capitalism is exposed for being \u201cexploitative\u201d, \u201coppressive\u201d, and \u201calienating\u201d, we will all naturally overthrow it. Putting aside the fact that these terms all carry clear moral weight, we can see that Marx thinks we have some desire to not be \u201cexploited, oppressed, or alienated\u201d.\n\nBut why? Well, according to Marx, there is some idea of human flourishing that capitalism stands in the way of. So Marx IS motivated by some ideal, an ideal where human nature can flourish. His motivation for opposing capitalism and writing his works is the hope that it will overthrow the system that stands in the way of human flourishing. The desire for human flourishing that Marx believes is both innate in all humans, and owed to them.\n\nMarx\u2019s project is ultimately motivated by how he sees the subject: desiring some kind of flourishing. This flourishing (in the little Marx wrote about this, so I sort of have to piece it together) involves some form of personal autonomy/freedom, economic autonomy/freedom, the lack of alienation from the self, and doesn\u2019t discriminate between people. This means it is essentally becomes universal freedom, with the addendum to Hegel that instead of JUST political freedom, it includes economic freedom as well. This is clarified in early Marx who was admittedly more Hegelian than late Marx, although seeing as he never provides any other motivation for his project, I feel it fair to ascribe this early view to his entire body.\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to explain to everyone here how being motivated by universal freedom is antithetical to Nietzsche. It\u2019s the most clear and transparent example of slave morality, that is entirely antithetical to Nietzsche\u2019s project of cultivating higher types.\u00a0\n\nPutting aside any internal contradictions (and there are plenty more than I talked about) in Marx, his project is still ultimately motivated by a desire for freedom. no matter how much he masks it. One that he claims isn\u2019t moral, but frequently exposes as moral through his incessant moralizing language, and his ultimate motivation: freedom in both the Hegelian and materialistic sense.\n\nThe link again: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1i61yrn/marxism\\_is\\_not\\_compatible\\_with\\_nietzsche/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nietzsche/comments/1i61yrn/marxism_is_not_compatible_with_nietzsche/)\n\n\u00a0",

            "body": "I would emphasize that Marx actually emphasizes the contradiction between the mode of production and social relations as more fundamental to class, and in fact informs what class exists and their objective antagonism. \n\nAlso, Marx does emphasize what is rational in human history because humans act on reason. This doesn\u2019t mean everything is wholly rational and reality empirically fits perfect reason, but things work themselves out in the material/natural world.\n\nhttps://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/Article_on_Teleology.pdf\n\u201cThe difference between logical necessity and causal necessity The sociologist Anthony Giddens claimed that the predictability manifested in social life is largely \u2018made to happen\u2019 by strategically placed social actors, not in spite of them or \u2018behind their backs\u2019. Far from people being driven to do what they do by remote or invisible \u2018structural forces\u2019, Giddens showed that \u201call explanations will involve at least implicit references both to the purposive, reasoning behavior of agents and to its intersection with constraining and enabling features of the social and material contexts\u201d (1984, p. 179). Giddens\u2019 research shows that individuals are generally well aware of the possible consequences of their actions, and are experts in the often lamentable situations in which they find themselves. Sociologists use Game Theory to study the various traps which confront people when are deemed to act as isolated individuals and they do gain certain insights into social problems. However, human society is not an aggregate of isolated atoms, and all manner of collective action from neighborhood solidarity to government action create and change the arrangements within which such \u2018rational actors\u2019 act. The situations in which the individuals make their decisions are the products of policy of strategic institutions. The rationality at work in the creation of institutions and customs is not a \u2018univocal\u2019 reason, but reflects a diversity of social interests and identities.  Any given social arrangement has an inherent \u2018logic\u2019 which constrain the actions of all the particular actors; no-one \u2018forces\u2019 any actor to act in a certain way (indeed they would not be actors at all if they were forced), but the social arrangements constrain them in what can be called \u2018logical necessity\u2019: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do X, but look at your options. You\u2019d be well advised to do X.\u201d But it does not stop there; people endeavor to change arrangements which do not suit them. Responses to institutional arrangements are a kind of practical critique of the concept on which the institution was based. Institutional arrangements will be changed in response to such critique and the changes decided upon by rational deliberations, however imperfect, will respond to the practical critique explicitly in the form of thinking and argument. Institutional change in modern societies is not like crowd behavior, but takes place according to what is found to be necessary in the circumstances. Institutions try to do what they have to do according to their concept, rather than simply striving to maintain a status quo. The only senses in which causal necessity can make sense in this context are (1) genuinely rare, unpredictable and unmanageable natural disasters, and (2) actions by individual and corporate actors which are senseless and delusional and which have extensive consequences. Such events could be deemed to be the cause of their results and do undermine the teleological character of history. But insofar as all corporate actors only do as they must, we can describe social history as the unfolding of \u2018logical necessity\u2019 inherent in the concepts of the various institutions and the relations between them. \u201d\n\nCapital for example isn\u2019t a recount of the empirical history of capitalism in all its empirical detail, but uses an abstraction of historical development to discern the nature of concepts of political economy.\n\nhttps://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/marxs-use-of-history.pdf\n\nSo Marx does posit a logical necessity to human action constrained by its niche constructionism of nature.\n\nI think they are correct that Marx may have an ethical ideal of human flourishing, but it\u2019s not a baseless ethics but one based on his conception of humans.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/brenkert.htm\n\u201cHowever, there is another understanding of morality which should not be forgotten. This is the sense of morality in which morality is linked with certain virtues, excellences, or flourishing ways of living. In this sense, morality is not primarily concerned with rules and principles, but with the cultivation of certain dispositions or traits of character. This view has been expressed in this way: \u2018The moral law ... has to be expressed in the form, \u201cbe this\u201d, not in the form, \u201cdo this\u201d ... the true moral law says \u201chate not\u201d, instead of \u201ckill not\u201d...... the only mode of stating the moral law must be a rule of character.\u2019 [28] This, I believe, is quite close to Marx\u2019s views.\u201d\n\nd-scholarship.pitt.edu/10867/1/VWills_ETD_2011.pdf\n\u201cThis line of thought can be applied to the question of whether or not \u201cman is the highest being for man,\u201d as Marx says, which expresses the same idea as the statement that the development of rich individuality is the highest moral aim. It is incoherent, and incommensurate with our scientific knowledge, to talk about value in a way that does not assume human beings and their productive activity as the source and ontological basis of all value in the world. \n\nOf course, in suggesting that in the absence of a greatly disturbed relationship to the human species and to the natural world, there can be no doubt that human flourishing as Marx describes it is the highest goal for human beings, I have relied heavily on a conception of just what human beings are, exactly. As I have alluded to above, species of Utilitarianism fail as  moral theories because they construe human beings too narrowly. In the place of the real human being himself, stands the human being\u2019s capacity to experience happiness, to avoid suffering, etc., abstracted away from the real human being. We are promised a theory about human beings, and instead we get a theory about sensitive blobs\u2014and worse yet, blobs that are sensitive to only one type of experience, of happiness, or of suffering. A wide range of human social relations are reduced to just one relation of usefulness. \n\nKantianism suffers similar problems, in that it is a moral theory based on the free will, which is itself an abstraction away from the human being. As long as the free will is properly constituted, it matters not what the effects of that will are in the material world. It is a theory unsuited to address the questions which face human beings as, precisely, natural and social beings whose essence is a metabolism with the natural world through the labor process. \u201c",

            "body": "It\u2019s for the most part not a critique of Marxism. The fundamental premise of the post\u2014that Marxism can\u2019t be meshed with Nietzscheanism\u2014is true. A caveat applies insofar as any ideology can technically be meshed with any other ideology. If you wanted to, you could think through Marx with Hitler, or vice versa, and, in fact, that\u2019s been done. There are people who have put Marx and Nietzsche in conversation, in one way or another, but I think the essential ideas of the two\u2019s beliefs are undeniably in conflict.\n\nThe ostensible contradiction in Marx\u2019s thought that OP points out is just sophistry from somebody who has nothing but a superficial knowledge of Marx. The idea that dialectics must be subordinate to dialectics is like saying gravity must itself be effected by gravity. Things are in movement; categories are not fixed. It does not logically follow that \u201cThings are in movement; categories are not fixed\u201d must also be in movement. The postulate arguably at the heart of dialectics\u2014\u201cThat which is actual is rational; that which is rational is actual\u201d\u2014does not contradict itself. \n\nThe criticism further down the line that Marx did not think he was himself influenced by material conditions is false. \n\nThe point about Marx\u2019s \u201cideal\u201d and his project of freedom is just bad philosophy from somebody who, again, has nothing but a superficial knowledge of Marx. I imagine their professor said something about Marxist-humanism, Althusser, an epistemological break, etc., and their mind went wild. Philosophers are the people most interested in the consequences of this controversy. To the extent that it matters, I think you have to enter into the debate with specific philosophical commitments to deny that Marx\u2019s thought changed dramatically in the 1840s. Either way, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cFreedom\u201d this, \u201cfreedom\u201d that, the overall point that Marx\u2019s concerns\u2014ethical or scientific, I\u2019ll leave it in the air for now\u2014were different than Nietzsche\u2019s is very true. Marx, in a simplistic way, envisioned a world that was beneficent for the majority, and Nietzsche envisioned a world that was run by violent tyrants.",
