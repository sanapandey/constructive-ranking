    "selftext": "I've only read passages from a selected works book for my phil class, so I have only read M+E's critiques of capitalism and religion. Now, I'm trying to learn more about what they actually wanted communism to look like, so I'm watching a lecture series on it (from the YT channel \"From Alpha to Omega\") and there is mostly talk of prices of goods being replaced with the time it takes to make those goods.\n\nHowever, I'm hoping to become a clinical psychologist (that practices psychotherapy) and it had me thinking about how unfair it would be if labor time was the sole determiner of my compensation. It could be argued that with my years of schooling (which have taken a ton of effort that I am assuming I'd be compensated for under communism) and with the cognitive and emotional resources that conducting therapy would take, I would not be able to work as many hours as a shoemaker, for example. \n\nThis discrepancy could be also demonstrated with the comparison of a construction worker vs a shoemaker, one job clearly costs you more physical and health resources. Labor workers tend to have numerous health problems because of this, and it is not solely because of lack of protections or them being overworked.\n\n**The picture becomes even more complicated when you add in having to compare different types of personal resources (e.g. cognitive, emotional, physical) on top of effort intensity and capacity for longevity in that line of work.** *How should we assess how labor should be compensated?*\n\nDid Marx and Engels ever address this question? If not, did any other left thinkers do so? Feel free to point out if any of my assumptions are unfair as well, I realized I may be operating from a sort of scarcity-mindset (I am currently busting my ass in school and trying to face up to the reality that I may not be able to own a home for a very long time).",

What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; ***the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it.*** \n\n>#He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. \n\n>**The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.**\n\n>Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.\n\n>Hence, equal right here is still in principle \u2013 bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.\n\n>In spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard, labor.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm\n\nNever thought i would see such a stupid response in the Marxism subreddit.",

In fact, the notion that it was an \"analysis of the stages of communism\" does not appear anywhere in the foreword by Engels or the related letters to Bracke and Bebel. This is all a bit strange: Marx is supposed to have made momentous discoveries about communism (the vaunted \"lower stage of communism\" - Marx doesn't even say that, he says \"the first phase\" - does not appear everywhere else in Marx's and Engels's works and is difficult to reconcile with Antiduhring, published just two years later), hidden them away in an expletive-ridden letter he never intended to have published, and then when Engels published the letter over a decade later he did not mention these discoveries at all. But again, that was not what Marx was doing in the Gothakritik - the point of the first part is an internal critique of Lassalle's economic theories, particularly the vaunted \"full proceeds of labour\", which would not make sense anyway on the assumption of a communist society where value has been abolished.",

The labor theory of value applies to any market state, but it manifests in different ways.\n\nEdit: Never mind, I understand your question now. Basically, labor can be commodified and traded like anything else. An employer can buy eight hours of abstract labor in the same way they buy an 8-pack of light bulbs, only it is called a day's wage instead of price. Wage labor bundles all the various kinds of tasks you would perform in the course of your duties into a very simple time-based model. This model returns value to the laborer as raw currency (money) and value to the employer as the accomplishment of immediate tasks.\n\nHopefully that answers your questions.",

The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working-day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working-days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working-day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. **Between equal rights force decides.** Hence is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working-day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital,\u00a0*i.e.,*\u00a0the class of capitalists, and collective labour,\u00a0*i.e.,*\u00a0the working-class.\n\n**\\[emphasis added\\]**  \n[Capital Vol. I - Chapter Ten, SECTION 1 THE LIMITS OF THE WORKING-DAY](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm)\n\n# 2.

But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only \u2013 for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth.

            "body": "Yes, Marx, and to some extent Engels, did address the difference in intensities of different types of Labour, with regards to compensation of it. First with regards to compensation, Engels, dismisses a classic point, that has become the Lynchpin of Austrian \"economists\" (they are more towards the sphere of legal studies, philosophy, then economics as a empirical science) like Hans Hermann Hoppe, called the atom model of social relationships, or by its more famous name, the Robinson Crusoe Model. The model, attempts to analyze a complete system, through means of hypothetical, and psychological abstractions, through two components, namely Robinson Crusoe and his friend Friday. This is what Engels writes with regards to Duhring attempting a similarly flawed abstraction (through which labour compensation was discounted):\n\n>When Herr D\u00fchring had thus learned what the basic form of exploitation common to all forms of production up to the present day is\u2014so far as these forms move in class antagonisms\u2014all he had to do was to apply his two men to it, and the deep-rooted foundation of the economics of reality was completed. He did not hesitate for a moment to carry out this \u201csystem-creating idea\u201d. Labour without compensation, beyond the labour-time necessary for the maintenance of the labourer himself\u2014 that is the point. The Adam, who is here called Robinson Crusoe, makes his second Adam\u2014Man Friday\u2014drudge for all he is worth. But why does Friday toil more than is necessary for his own maintenance? To this question, too, Marx step by step provides an answer. But this answer is far too long-winded for the two men. The matter is settled in a trice: Crusoe \u201coppresses\u201d Friday, compels him \u201cto render economic service as a slave or a tool\u201d and maintains him, but \u201conly as a tool\u201d. With these latest \u201ccreative turns\u201d of his, Herr Duhring kills as it were two birds with one stone. Firstly, he saves himself the trouble of explaining the various forms of distribution \\[systems\\] which have hitherto existed, their differences and their causes; taken in the lump, they are simply of no account\u2014they rest on oppression, on force. We shall have to deal with this before long. Secondly he transfers he whole theory of distribution from the sphere of economics to that of morality and law, that is, from the sphere of established material facts to that of more or less vacillating opinions and sentiments. He therefore no longer has any need to investigate or to prove things; he can go on declaiming to his heart\u2019s content and demand that the distribution of the products of labour should be regulated, not in accordance with its real causes, but in accordance with what seems ethical and just to him, Herr Duhring. (Engels, 'anti-duhring', pp.191,192)\n\nBasically, Engels states here, that compensation for labour is indeed necessary, however he does not base it on a purely Neo-classical, or proto-neoclassical framework like Lassalle does, with his 'iron law of wages', Engel's modification of the classic supply and demand law, is by seeing the fluctuating factors, that cause a market equilibrium to occur, in a periodic and cyclical fashion (akin to a sinusoidal wave function). With regards to the different intensity of Labour, across the times of Labour, and its not a simple causal relationship of \"more labour time = more efficient\", to quote Engels again:\n\n>But not all labour is a mere expenditure of simple human labour-power; very many sorts of labour involve the use of capabilities or knowledge acquired with the expenditure of greater or lesser effort, time and money. Do these kinds of compound labour produce, in the same interval of time, the same commodity values as simple labour, the expenditure of mere simple labour-power? Obviously not. **The product of one hour of compound labour is a commodity of a higher value\u2014perhaps double or treble\u2014in comparison with the product of one hour of simple labour**. (Engels, 'anti-Duhring', pp.240,241)\n\nSo, in regards to Labour intensity, let's make a simple abstraction, of skilled worker A and unskilled worker B, were, working towards creating a toy car, worker B creates the same toy car in 3 hours, while worker A achieves the task in 1 hour, thereby making worker A more efficient. Note, that I have not added the point about the use- exchange value debate, but the central point, with regards to Labour intensity, is to oppose the idea that Labour time and Labour intensity are independent, and that Labour time (as in the time you use to create a product of consumption in this case) is not merely about how many hours of effort you put into it, instead its the intensity of that effort, that acts as a force multiplier. Overall, Engel's idea of compensation, should be viewed through the general lens, of the flaws within the perfect Neo-classical supply-demand models, and their likewise static derivatives, and also against the extreme proto-Austrian Duhring types, who argue against the idea of compensation, not even on economic, but on moral and psychological grounds (the complete basis of Mises's praxelogy, catallactics (which was to substitute empiricism, in order to observe the emergent phenomena of Market economies). So, yes Marx and Engels, not only addressed this point, but made it central to the LTV. This also comes to the point, why the idea of measuring use value itself, or in this case the subjective evaluations of commodities by consumers, who hope to satisfy their particular wants, would be exceptionally difficult, since unlike exchange value, where you can say well there was 10 linen exchanged with like 5 kittens, and then can have some standard measure, you cannot say well I want 10 happiness, or 10 sadness (based on the quality and use of the commodity, that is sold to the consumer), by creating independent models of consumer behavior, since that would make it sound nonsensical. So, Engels, bringing up the point Labour intensity, is a pretty significant addition, especially to dispel some common myths about the LTV.",

Under lower stage communism, schooling and training are paid professions. This is perfectly in line with the labor theory of value. It just so happens to be that the value produced by education is \"stored\" within yourself, so to speak. Under capitalism, you own this value, you can get extra compensation for it, so you also pay to produce it (tuition fees). Under communism, this value could be paid for collectively, and you don't get extra compensation for it. The end result is that your career path has no effect on overall lifetime compensation.\n\nThis makes perfect economic sense. On an individual level, people should do jobs based on their personal interest/skill instead of financial considerations, while on a collective level, you want to direct people to jobs based on the economic plan rather than having people overcrowding some jobs because of high pay and have shortages in other jobs because of low pay.\n\nAs for the personal burdens for doing various jobs? Dealing with that is a very specific question that isn't really very useful to discuss in advance. We don't even know what jobs will look like under future societies.",

I think this makes sense since payroll is added into the cost of running a business just like any other input. Workers are treated just like any other piece of capital (thing that gets invested and reinvested to turn profits). Except they\u2019re the only input that allows the investment to be realized. No workers, no business. Automation complicates this further, but it also explains why the rate of profit has been declining over time.",

Value exists as a relationship between commodities, not in each commodity considered in isolation, but only between commodities when they are placed in an exchange relationship with each other, when they are exchange values. Value is the social average which governs that exchange. But mass commodity production is a feature of capitalist society (along with prices and money). A socialist society, by contrast, would be the cooperative commonwealth. Production in that society would be suited to need and regulated by a democratically determined plan. Because things that once were \"commodities\" would not be produced for profit (and so would not have exchange value and so would not really commodities any longer), the capitalist law of value would no longer apply.\n\nThat said, Marx does assume that a socialist society would initially emerge from a capitalist society and so would initially be characterized by the features of that capitalist society. It's those limitations which lead people to assume that initial socialist compensation would be related to labor time/intensity. That may have made sense if one were assuming (as Marx and Engels were) that socialism would occur in the 19th century and would follow immediately from the features of 19th century industrial capitalism, but it seems to me that modern capitalist society (at least in the first world) is today way past that point as evidenced by the modern welfare state. (Reformist liberals routinely echo sentiments similar to \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\".) I see no obvious reason why initial socialist society following from modern capitalism would need to be grounded on compensation tied to labor time.",
