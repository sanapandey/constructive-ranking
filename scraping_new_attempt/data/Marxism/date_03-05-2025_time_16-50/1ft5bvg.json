    "selftext": "I'm a Marxist and read a fair amout of Marx and his theory of the capitalist system in Capital Vol. 1-3. \n\nBUT: I still don't get it, why only humans create value according to him. I had a few thoughts about it like that only humans can generate more than they need, because of our ability to work with our intelligence. Or because our calorie intake is so low in comparison to what we can do with our muscles or intelligence. \n\nWhen it comes to machines and why they can't create value I thought about the second theorem of thermodynamics. It basically says that a machine can never produce more energy than what it uses up when in use (perpetuum mobiles are impossible). In the long run machines will always cost more than what they can produce for sale, as kind of analogy of value to energy. \n\n\nThis point is important, because Marx says that the profit rate goes down after capitalists replace workers with machines. This would mean that after the replacement of workers by AI and robots then capitalism would even further go into a general economic crisis with very low growth and low demand because of high unemployment. \n",

            "body": "My suggestion is to abandon the idea of energy expenditure, calorie intake, or the second law of thermodynamics, etc. Value not a physiological product or unit, it is the product of a social relation. It works the same way as other social relations work, such as language. That is, there is no \"inherent\" meaning to a word, nor do we collectively decide what words mean. Words are endowed with meaning in sort of indirect way, without anyone actually establishing a fix meaning. Even if words might mean or connote different things to different people, groups, subcultures, etc., there is still a general understanding of what words mean. We do not realise we are doing it, but our day to day partaking in language is the only thing that sustains the meaning of a word, and we all act as if a word has a specific meaning because the assumption is that everyone else believes it has that meaning.\n\n\nValue works in a similar way. There's no physical unit such as energy expenditure which defines value. Value exists only insofar as the social relations that will sustain it continue to exist. No one person decides the value of a commodity, but the general principles of the market, which acts as if of its own accord, despite being constituted by the acts of real people, determines the value.\u00a0\n\n\nOnly humans can create value because it's a human, social relation. Although it's entirely true that animals are part of production process and their energy expenditure can be way higher than humans', we simply act as if they don't count, and therefore when the market values the commodity, the animal labour isn't recognized. This however would change if our social relations changed. So to answer your question in short: value is only created by humans because we *act* as if that's the case, and value is nothing other than a concretised form of our social relations.",

Does the value created by the human labor to produce such a self-sufficient AI just carry over into the output of that AI? What if it takes human much less labor power to create a copy of that AI? Also, what happens if that AI can create copies of itself and or improve itself?

If today this number drops to 5 workers using machines, it does not mean that the machine produces the labor of 20 workers. Rather, it can only be said that the necessary social production time required to satisfy a need has decreased; in other words, these workers have become more productive with the aid of the machine.\n\nAs you mentioned, even when everything is produced by machines, these machines will have a lifespan and will require regular maintenance. Therefore, even if a shirt is produced by a robot that performs every task, it will only reduce the social production time necessary to meet the demand.\n\nBut let's assume that robots provide their own maintenance and reproduction, as you suggest, and no human is involved in the production process. In that case, the human labor transferred into producing the first robot would determine the social production time needed for production. After that, labor would continue to be transferred until each subsequent robot copy further reduced the required social production time for producing the good. Ultimately, due to the law of diminishing returns, it would be impossible to produce more than a certain number of robots while maintaining efficient production. The labor embodied in the production of the first robot would be transferred to every copy and approach zero as the process continued indefinitely, and the robots would reproduce themselves. Therefore, the value would approach zero indefinitely.\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that in a capitalist economy, the value of a good is not equal to its price. The price is influenced by various factors, such as scarcity or consumer preferences.",

So in the scenario where socially necessary labor time approaches zero with the self-maintaining self-reproducing robots that produce shirts, it's effectively the same as finding an apple on a tree outside or being on a strange mechanical planet whose natural envirobment produces shirts. The production of the apple or shirt both occur independent of human/sentient social relations. So does nature not create value? Or does it just create natural resources that can be used as is or transformed by human labor? In the case of the former, wouldn't using something as is be a use value?",

If you catch a fish by using this stick as a harpoon, you will have put this stick into production relations as a tool of fixed capital. \n\nThe fish you are holding in your hand is the result of the combination of two different capitals.

I'll try to weave this web in my own way, but it's not going to be exactly what Marx says:\n\nMachines are made by humans, so what ever is produced by the machines, are produced by the people who worked on the machine. This is not, however, the point of why value is bound to humanity. Bees (as some suggest), cannot create value. The reason value is, as a concept, tied to being a human, is because only that which is valued by someone else can have value. And no, I'm not misunderstanding Marx here, I'm not saying the subject preferences endows the value, merely, as Marx says, without such endowment, there cannot be anything like value. In other words, it is a relationship. In this limited sphere we are here talking about, it is a relationship between work, in the form of the amount of time used to produce something, and someone wanting it.\n\nThere is much more to this, but I'll limit myself to this, for now. The point being: the reason only humans can produce value is because value is a relationship between the one producing, and the one consuming (buying). And those things only exist between humans.",

This is markedly different from the way \"free\" laborers impart value.\n\nThis is not to say that slaves and animals don't produce use values in excess of the cost of their upkeep - on the contrary, both are often worked to death - but this is does not become value - a social thing that can only be realized in exchange - on the market, and the beast-farmer relationship is not a market.

In other words, he's attempting to explain why mass production schemes result in lower prices and reduced profit margins over time despite apparently cheaper costs of production. Marx argues that machine production is much more easily replicated than human labor, and markets approach a state of \"perfect competition\" (where the best a producer can do is break even) the more similar producers' products are. Human labor is much more variable in quality because human talents and skills tend to be much more unique, and markets are less competitive when certain producers disproportionately possess higher quality labor and, therefore, produce higher quality products.

It is under capitalism that human labour power is commodified, for the first time in recorded history. This has implications for the productive process, and the concept of exploitation. Labour's daily costs must be incorporated or \"buried\" into each product created every day. Consequently, exploitation is premised upon a working day being split in two different parts: that part of the day dedicated to creating value equal in product to those specific costs (relative surplus value), and the balance of the work day producing value for \"free\" (absolute surplus value). \n\nAs capitalism is premised on competition, there is the goal of maximizing market share through cheapening the cost of production, and a utilizes labour displacing technology to achieve cost savings at the level of relative surplus value. However, this is contradictory.\n\n\"In order to produce surplus value it is necessary to have working workers, and this being the case, the fraction of the workday in which the worker reproduces \\[their\\] own wage cannot fall to [zero.It](http://zero.It) can be reduced from 8 hours to 7 hours to 7, from 7 hours to 6 \\[etc., etc.\\] from 1 hour to 50 minutes. It would already be a fantastic productivity which would permit the worker to produce the counter-value of \\[their\\] entire wage in 50 minutes. But \\[they\\] could never reproduce the counter-value of \\[their\\] entire wage in zero minutes and zero seconds. There is a residual which capitalist exploitation can never suppress.\"  Ernest Mandel, \"Introduction to Marxist Economic Theory\", pp. 50.\n\nTHAT is why only humans can create value.\n\nThis has important implications for the law of the falling rate of profit, as well as the transition to a socialist economy if we examine Hegel's concept of \"the other\":\n\n\"To understand the nature of the being \\[in this case, a commodity\\] which we have in any particular instance, we must know, not only in a general way what kind of being it is, but we have to know definitely at just what point a variation in its quality will subject it to a complete transformation into some other kind of being altogether. It is impossible to conceive of a limit which would be the boundary of only one thing, for while it bounds one, it separates at the same time from something else. Therefore, every determinate being necessarily implies that something lies beyond its limit; this something Hegel calls its *other* \\[...\\] The other is that which not only lies outside the sphere of some definite being, but at the same time it must lie within the boundaries of some common system to which both may be referred.

Follow the chain back far enough and you eventually get simple prehistoric tools made by hand, i.e. just raw materials and labour. So any value created by a tool is ultimately created by hundreds of generations of labour.\n\nThen for raw materials, what value does a chunk of Iron ore sitting in the ground have? Basically none. In order for it to become valuable, it needs to be dug out of the ground and smelted into an ingot of Iron or steel. That is also value created by labour.\n\nAlso because I'm nitpicky, conservation of energy is the 1st law of thermodynamics. The 2nd law is that enclosed systems tend towards thermal equilibrium.",

            "body": "A big part of confusion come from mixing up 3 different meaning of Value.\n\nThere is Value to society. How much it cost to society in order to produce something. That what Marx mean under \"Value\" most of the time. Then there is exchange value, that what pro Capitalism economists mean under \"Value\" most of the time, because that they interested in. And finally there is use value. How much consumer benefit from commodity. This three meaning of value are in depended from each other, except in rare cases.\n\nLets demonstrate that.\n\nImagine a futuristic society where everything produced by self replicating robots. What Value what they produce have? Zero, as no human labor involve, there is no cost to society. Do they produce use value? not really, they produce potential, I will explain later. What exchange value (again, a different variable, as exchange value exist only in market economy) that has? Again Zero, as you can have anything you want at all time.\n\nIn a way, we have such machine, Nature. It produce air with out which we can not live. It use value is infinite, it Value is zero - no human labor used. It exchange value is zero, again, in normal condition it is abundant and available at any time.\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/)\n\n\"Production is consumption, Consumption is production\" - dialectical nature of production. What we can take from this? No value created with out consumption. If no one use air - no use value is created. If no one use commodity - no production value is created. It is pointless to produce something which no one use. Same true about exchange value.\n\nBut how we should understand value of an art? What I will discuss does not apply only to art, but it is just much more clear in case of an art.\n\nWe establish that with out consumption there is no value. But does value depends on consumption? Yes.\n\nLets introduce labor of consumption. Consumption is not free. Some one need to spend time and often his mind, his imagination, his mental abilities in order to extract value.\n\nIf you read scientific book, use value you extracted from it depends on how much time you spend, how well you prepared to understand and your imagination, looking how you can use this information, potentially. Same apply to art, Art effect as because we relate it to as, We do emotional labor trying to understand art. And when we do, quality of art effect how much it effect as, how much use value we get from it.\n\nAn other example, a well prepared dinner. If you have time to sit down in a nice place and enjoy your dinner - you will get much more use value, You are not only get better physical enjoyment, but your body will process food better. On other hand you can stuff this food why jingling children or try to finish work. You still will get something, but much less. Consumption is not free, it cost is labor of consumption. Why do you think your mother wanted you to sit at table and enjoy food she prepare, socialize with your family? She wanted for you to extract max value from her food, from your time with family and get value form you. She loved to see you enjoy her cooking, talk to her. In a way she consumed a family dinner she prepared. That is not a market value, but it is use value of her labor for her.\n\nEvery moment of life has value. When you stop to enjoy a view, listen to birds songs you perform a labor of consumption, which actually create value, not nature. Not self replicating machine. Nature, self replicating machine create a potential, not realized value, but your labor is necessary for value to be created, realized. So, at the end of the day, there no use value with out human labor.\n\nIn Capital Max did try to unite production value with exchange value. It does not actually work. Exchange value come from markets, which is a human construct. But there are some limitations on independence of exchange value and production value. For example, if Labor not paid enough to eat, then you hit bottom line from labor side. Same true about exchange value of commodity. If it fall below \"bottom line\", not profitable to produce, then you hit bottom line from commodity side.\n\nSo, then if society does not produce much excess, then exchange value will stay close to production value. That what Marx observed. But if Society produce big excess, then Social construct of market play bigger role. Example, effect of monopolies, patents, trademarks, exchange values of currencies, et, imposed by all means , including military. Ideal market Market Capitalists imagine can not exist, as actors do not have equal power.",

Human need payment to sustain their Life. \n\nAnimals and maschine don't need something equal. Wikd animals sustain them. Domesticated animals create value, but it works differently. \n\nSo if you look at a very early stage of profit making. You would have a Smith. He sells nails, you buy those nails, to build a fence. So the price for the nails includes the cost of living from the Smith but also includes the cost for the iron ore the Smith had to pay to the mine worker. So this iron ore is basically free. Nobody has to buy anything it's just there. You only need to invest human time to reach it, and this time or the cost of living for this time is basically the price of the iron ore. So if you pay for the nail, you also pay for the mineworker. \n\nBut this is all without any capitalist. \n\n>This would mean that after the replacement of workers by AI and robots then capitalism would even further go into a general economic crisis with very low growth and low demand because of high unemployment. \n\nSo the growth can't grow anymore because everything or almost everything is capitalist by now. So there is no new demand coming from anywhere it's just shifting from one source to another source. Also, because the people don't have more money, then before. \n\nThe unemployment rate will not generally rise. Because it could be that unemployed people. Will find work if there are new cooperations looking for highly skilled workers. Also, this process is very slow, so it won't happen simultaneously in every company. \n\nIf you get high unemployment rates, this will crash the economy because the people won't have money to spend, so nobody will buy stuff, which leads to more unemployment, and then it goes on. Capitalism will then kill itself in the one way or another.",

So we get a bunch of use-values out of factory entirely operated by machines. Who is getting paid? They would just be acquired and used. They don\u2019t struggle to be recognized for a greater wage. Such objects would be practically be free because they are so readily produced.\n\nTo emphasize the social relation of value.\nhttps://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/tag/money/\n\u201cWith each successive revolution in robotics more and more types of activity are removed from the list of \u201cexclusive human activities\u201d, leaving less and less options for those who want to point to an essential aspect of human labor that differentiates it from machines.  In the above passage Marx brings out probably the most essential difference between human labor and the work of machines: that the worker imagines the product and process before she commences production. However, in this age of rapid advances in computing and artificial intelligence I believe it is dangerous to hinge our argument on an aspect of human work that is directly under attack by the artificial intelligence industry. I think it is much more fruitful to find a unique property of human labor that holds even if robots one day can do every task that humans can do.\n\nCaffentzis makes, in my opinion, the only possible argument: \u201cif labor is to create value while machines do not, then labor\u2019s value creating capacities must lie in its negative capability, its capacity to refuse to be labor.\u201d [\u201cWhy Machines Cannot Create Value\u201d Caffentzis 1997 in \u201cCutting Edge\u201d ed. Jim Davis] In other words, what makes humans different than machines is that humans can refuse to work. This makes human labor a social relation. Humans must be coerced/convinced to do work. They do not operate like machines that can be just turned on and off. This distinction brings out the coercive side of value relations. Feudal society had knights and the Catholic Church to make the serfs work the land. Capitalism has value relations which are their own form of coercion.\n\nOf course if robots ever evolved to the point in which they could refuse to work then their work would also become a social relation and thus would be value creating. Of course, if this ever happens we might have more important problems on our hands\u2026\u201d",
