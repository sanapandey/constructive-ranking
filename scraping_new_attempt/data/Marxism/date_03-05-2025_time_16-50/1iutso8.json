You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was written with the aim of providing the working class, its historical gravedigger, with the theoretical weapons necessary for its overthrow and the transition to a higher socio-economic order, international socialism.\n\n>It is highly significant, therefore, that in Harvey\u2019s interview on\u00a0*Capital*\u00a0and its significance, the words \u201csocial revolution\u201d and \u201cworking class\u201d never appear.\n\n>What then is the essential content of the interview? It is the dressing up in Marxist-sounding terminology of the politics of the middle class pseudo-left, focusing on protests against some of the irrationalities and outrages of the capitalist system, concerned not with its overthrow but \u201clife-style changes.\u201d Its role is to seek to divert those seeking answers away from a real grappling with and understanding of Marx\u2019s masterwork.\n\n>Harvey presents the three volumes of\u00a0*Capital*\u00a0as something of a jumble, that Marx was saying \u201cin volume one, I deal with this, in volume two I deal with that and in volume three I deal with something else.\u201d\n\n>Harvey goes on to say that Marx has in mind \u201cthe totality of the circulation of capital\u201d but then points to a problem because Marx did not complete volumes two and three (they were edited by Engels from Marx\u2019s drafts) and so they \u201caren\u2019t as satisfactory as volume one.\u201d\n\n>The upshot of this focus on circulation is twofold. First, it leaves the impression that there is no inherent logic to Marx\u2019s presentation. Second, it downplays the centrality of capitalist production, dissolving it in the process of circulation, a move which, as we shall see, forms a key foundation of Harvey\u2019s political perspective.\n\n...

But as he notes, the analysis does not complete the life cycle of capital and so in volume two he considers how the process of production is supplemented by the process of circulation.\n\n>In volume three the issue is to \u201cdiscover and present the concrete forms which grow out of the process of capital\u2019s movement considered as a whole.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe configurations of capital, as developed in this volume,\u201d he writes, \u201cthus approach step by step the form in which they appear on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another, i.e., in competition, and in the everyday consciousness of the agents of production themselves.\u201d \\[1\\]\n\n>The materialist method employed by Marx is to ascend from the most abstract forms to the concrete.\u00a0*Capital*, therefore, begins with the cell-form of the capitalist economy, the commodity, in which the product of human labour\u2014the basis of all society\u2014presents itself in the social form of a product produced for exchange.  \n...  \n[A promotion of the \u201clife-style\u201d politics of the pseudo-left - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2018/07/21/harv-j21.html)\n\nEND",
