She placed Marx as an idealist and a metahistorian and talked about the \"dangers of putting ideology in viewing history\". She even doubted Marx was a Feminist when I asked her on what Metahistory is, she said it focuses on the history of philosophy and the human conscience and that there need to be class conflict in it. Is my prof's views on Marx's Historical and Dialectical Materialism true?",

This is common among liberals and generally among more politically naive and empirically minded academics.\n\nThe reality is that we always have background assumptions about what is important and how events are casually connected. Those are ideological assumptions. At the most basic level, every history is going to have to focus on certain facts and ignore others. Every history is going to have to have a beginning and an end. Which facts you select to focus on and to begin and end your history is dependent upon your ideology. The best we can do is to have thoughtful and plausible ideological assumptions. You can safely roll your eyes and ignore anyone who suggests they we should step outside of those assumptions and focus on history, itself. (They say that because they have unstated, alternate ideological assumptions which likely will not stand up to scrutiny but which they prefer.)",

There are always underlying assumptions. Here is what he sent me probably copy and pasted from elsewhere:\n\nA \u201cPierre Duhem experiment\u201d is not a specific experiment itself, but rather refers to the philosophical concept that a single experiment cannot definitively prove or disprove a scientific hypothesis in isolation, as it always relies on a network of auxiliary assumptions, making a \u201ccrucial experiment\u201d impossible; this idea is known as the \u201cDuhem-Quine thesis\u201d in philosophy of science. \nKey points about Duhem\u2019s concept:\nNo isolated testing:\nWhen testing a hypothesis, scientists must rely on other theoretical assumptions about the experimental setup, instruments, and background knowledge, meaning you cannot isolate the hypothesis being tested from other factors. \nCritique of \u201ccrucial experiments\u201d:\nDuhem argued that a \u201ccrucial experiment,\u201d designed to definitively choose between two competing theories, is impossible in practice because of the reliance on auxiliary hypotheses. \nHolistic view of science:\nThis idea highlights that scientific theories are not tested in isolation, but rather as a whole interconnected system. \nExample to illustrate the concept:\nImagine an experiment to test the theory of gravity by dropping an object. Even if the object falls at an unexpected rate, this could be attributed to air resistance, the properties of the object itself, or issues with the measuring device, rather than invalidating the theory of gravity completely.",

Like famously the barter system never existed in the way Adam Smith assumed, people just remembered who owed who what basically. \n\nIf those facts create a liberal worldview, then someone can just go find and publish other facts and it will change the narrative, in fact they sell very well. They just don\u2019t have a lot of \u201cfacts\u201d driving the ground floor compared with the alternative which is comprised of the life\u2019s work of thousands. But the nature of what can be quantified by fact in the social sciences especially further back in time is always the problem for leftist critiques of our centuries of progress. \n\nActively choosing to believe your ideology has justified facts that you haven\u2019t found already is the dumb part- actual history work is built on things far more nebulous and ephemeral than \u201cideology\u201d on the level you are talking about. And much if it is very favorable at looking at institutions and social practices they very much disagree with to understand them better. If anything this is an incredibly reductive view of history and if anything is a valid criticism of \u201chistory communication\u201d that reaches high school and undergraduate level.\n\nI say all of this as someone who probably agrees with you but your 1 minute oversimplification misrepresents the problem, the people in it, and its nature - and is itself built from the oversimplified experience of leftists working in social sciences and history in like the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. There are objective circumstances we can understand, but there are always more than 1 lens worth looking at them through.

So: \"The present is (and is exclusively) a result of a series of events from the past, and always has been\"\n\nIt feels pretty like a pretty intuitive concept to be honest but you've got to remember the time it was written in. A lot of the philosophy was of ideas and a lot of it assumed that there was some force outside of the universe (either God, or some predestined 'order', or that each person materially created their own universe by observing it) which either guided or dictated the passage of history.\n\n2.\n\nMarx's writings on historical materialism also probably don't count as metahistory, any more than any other historian's personal biases shape their view of history. It's not so much that Marx decided there should be a class conflict then went and built history around it, but rather used the framing of 'class conflict' as a way to interpret the specific history of labor relations.\n\nThis is a perfectly normal way to do history, you pick a framing device and observe it through history. Historians of race relationships, gender identitiy, textile manufacture, etc.. do the same thing.\n\nBecause Marx studied dialectics his focus was on how contradictions in systems caused the events which propagated history.\n\nTo what extend Marx was **right** is totally debatable. He had a biased access to other people's biased accounts of history and wrote much of what he did without our 150-ish years of additional knowledge. It's perfectly possible to cherry pick history to make any point about just about anything. To this end it is appropriate to apply Marx's methods when considering historical materialism, not just his observations.\n\nIt is worth noting Marx (and Engels to be fair, this was mostly his domain) seem to have understood history pretty well and in a few cases predicted historical events and concepts that hadn't been proved or were widely shunned at the time.\n\n3.\n\nMeta history isn't bad per se. Studying Marx's approach to history *is* metahistorical and can be useful. It just isn't really applicable to the idea of historical materialism itself.\n\n4.\n\nThere **are** dangers of ideologically viewing history. Unfortunately history is studied by historians who all have ideologies of their own. In general this is also why Marx shouldn't be studied in a vacuum.\n\nMarxist scholars tend to be concerned with how historical materialism can be applied to affect change and avoid disaster. To this end the most valuable criteria of a historical materialist interpretation is how it can be used to predict and inform our understanding of the present and the future.\n\n5.\n\nDialectical and Historical Materialism both informed what we'd call Marxism today but they are separate concepts. When applied together they are:\n\n\"Understanding the world as a series of continuous changes from the past, caused by the contradictions of all objects in it\"\n\n  \nHope this helps. Your prof seems to be carrying some anti-marx sentiment. To be fair this sub will carry some pro-marx sentiment. Take both on board and decide which makes sense.",

Whether he was a 'good' femenist, even less so.\n\nPersonally (THIS IS VERY MUCH MY OPINION) I don't think of his work as very femenist, just because it wasn't particularlly concerned with women's liberation at all. That's not to say he was anti-femenist, he just mostly wrote about class relations. These are somewhat applicable to the gender conflicts, and Marxist-femenist scholars (e.g Angela Davies) have expanded on these ideas but it just wasn't really his subject of focus.\n\nWe can say he was in favour of Women's liberation *for the part that would play in worker's liberation* and Engels had some very precient ideas about how the oppression of Women related to the conception of class relationships in early humans.\n\nBut his work is pretty quiet on gender relations overall.",

            "body": "That is weird.. how is Marx an \"idealist\"?? Marx asserted that the history of humankind is also a history of class struggle. Which is a perspective he came to after rigorous analysis, he didn't make it up. We understand Science in the same way, we must understand how things came to be before we move on ahead with them. Historical materialism applied to society is the same. We cannot understand things detached from their history and we also cannot disregard history in terms of why things are the way they are. Yes, it's metahistory and it's not a bad thing. Marx and Engels wrote against Idealism, how are they idealists??\n\nHistorical materialism is important to understand in terms how things came to be and most importantly, a materialist view of history actually stands in support of necessity and accidents which lead to any particular significant event given the material conditions, instead of events taken out of context and studied. Marx doesn't need to be a feminist tbh. The application of historical materialism to political analysis has significantly helped feminist analysis and that matters more, in my opinion. \n\nI'm not sure if you have read it already or not, but I highly (HIGHLY!!!) recommend reading and understanding what Marxists have to say about Historical Materialism first, before jumping into the recommendations of, \"Here's the best, well-known critique of Marx.\" We must engage with Marx and Marxism before we critique, especially whilst we live in times of red scare.
