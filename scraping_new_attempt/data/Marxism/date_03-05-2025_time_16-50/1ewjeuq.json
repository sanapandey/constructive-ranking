    "selftext": "How can people here on the left deal with problem of evangelicals in the US.\n\nSo how can people here on the left here deal with the republican party and evangelicals that is very reactionary? And is destroying the US and holding back left political parties in the US?\n\nI read the the reason why evangelicals hate helping the weak, feeding the hungry, helping the poor and homeless , healing the sick, and universal healthcare and dealing evils of capitalism. They don\u2019t like that at all because they view it had destroying individual agency what ever they mean by that.\n\nHere is snip how Christians took over the Republican Party.\n\nThis explains how Christians took over the Republican Party and why they are the way they are.\n\nBefore I start, it\u2019s important to note that Christians in the United States make up the majority of both political parties and are relatively evenly split politically. According to Pew\u2019s Religious Landscape Survey from 2014, 40% of Christians identified or leaned Democratic while 44% identified or leaned Republican. African American Christians have been among the most solid supporters of the Democratic party, while Catholics and Mainline Protestants are divided. Simply being Christian is far less of a predictor of political leanings than gender, age, income, or race.\n\nWhy Do We Associate the Republican Party with Christianity?\n\nThe reason why you associate Christianity with the Republican Party (also known as the Grand Old Party, or GOP) is because the party has white evangelicals as a core constituency. White evangelicals currently make up about 25 percent of the American population and are a particularly visible group. Theologically, evangelicals teach that the Bible is without error, and they often hold a belief in an imminently forthcoming apocalypse that would be linked to the return of Christ (the most common of these views is called dispensational premillennialism, and is what evangelicals mean when they talk about believers ascending to heaven during the rapture). Republicans sought voters, and white evangelical leaders hoped to achieve their social agenda, so the two sides courted each other starting during the 1930s. However, it took until the 1980s for evangelicals to become a solidly Republican voting bloc.\n\nWhen Did the Relationship Between Evangelicals and Republicans Start?\n\nIn the 1930s, some of the forerunners of modern white evangelicals, the fundamentalists, quickly grew to hate Franklin D. Roosevelt with a passion. There were many reasons for this; FDR repealed prohibition, which was a key issue for these Christians, and they saw the creation of Social Security and other social welfare programs as destroying individual agency. These fundamentalists also complained that Roosevelt\u2019s administration was too dominated by academics and Jews, and they saw modern liberalism as satanic.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, a number of fundamentalists had become convinced that FDR was associated with the Antichrist, a theological figure of ultimate evil that would presage the end of the world. Leaders of what would become evangelicalism. like Harold Ockenga, saw Hitler, Stalin, and Roosevelt as roughly equivalent figures. Because of their hatred of of FDR, fundamentalists were receptive to supporting the Republicans.\n\nFundamentalists saw their hatred of FDR as an extension of their feud with Protestant modernists, the forebearers of contemporary Mainline Protestantism. Modernists thought the Bible was an ancient text that should be viewed metaphorically and did not believe in an imminent end of the World. Modernists embraced a \u201csocial gospel,\u201d where Christianity required caring for the poor and disenfranchised and making structural changes to society to reduce or eliminate this kind of suffering. Fundamentalists worried that FDR\u2019s liberalism was essentially a governmental version of modernist ideas.\n\nNixon and the Emergence of Republican Evangelicalism\n\nDespite fundamentalism's flirtation with the GOP, when their successors, modern evangelicals, formed into a distinct movement by the 1940s, they were not yet a politically uniform group. During the 1964 election, the magazine Christianity Today surveyed evangelical publishers, and found they supported Johnson against Goldwater at roughly the same rate as the rest of the U.S. population.\n\nMany evangelicals' views aligned more with Republicans. They were zealously anticommunist. They were also either very tepid supporters of civil rights or outright opposed to it, which would lead them to gravitate away from the Democrats during the 1960s. They were concerned about the growing political and social power of Catholics and Jews, who tended to be more affiliated with the Democratic Party. They were enraged that a liberal Supreme Court removed prayer and Bible reading from public schools. Yet evangelicals worried about being too politically involved, and evangelical leaders like Billy Graham were initially reluctant to openly support any candidate. Baptist minister Jerry Falwell denounced the political involvement of ministers like Martin Luther King in 1965, declaring, \u201cPreachers are not called to be politicians, but soul winners.\u201d\n\nDuring his presidency, Richard Nixon began to court evangelicals. He had lost the support of mainline Protestants over Vietnam, so he used evangelicals to fill the void. Nixon invited the head of the Southern Baptist Convention to preach in the White House, and Nixon managed to convince the Southern Baptist Convention to pass a resolution in 1970 endorsing his policy in Vietnam.\n\nNixon made a case to evangelicals that he was their man. He publicly known to be friends with evangelical minister Billy Graham, who campaigned for him. Harold Ockenga, the first president of the National Association of Evangelicals, endorsed Nixon in 1972. In that election, 82% of evangelicals voted for Nixon.\n\nCarter\n\nYet Democratic evangelicals still existed. In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist and a Democrat, won the presidency. Carter nearly split the evangelical vote, though his opponent Gerald Ford won a slight majority, with 51% of the vote.\n\nCarter managed to alienate many evangelicals. By 1978, Carter suggested that gays and lesbians were not a threat and there should not be limits on gay rights. He also was supportive of feminism and backed international efforts for women\u2019s equality, such as the UN\u2019s International Women\u2019s Year in 1975, which evangelicals saw as a threat to traditional gender roles.\n\nAbortion was also becoming a major issue for evangelicals in 1970s. Evangelicals initially did not engage much with the issue, seeing it as too Catholic, and even sometimes supported abortion rights. But by the 1970s, they increasingly were opposed to it, and the Democratic Party was becoming more in favor.\n\nReagan and the Moral Majority\n\nThe election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was a watershed moment for evangelicals politically and saw the creation of the modern Christian right. In 1979, Baptist minister Jerry Falwell formed the Moral Majority, which began to register voters and try to mobilize evangelicals to vote for socially conservative candidates. It succeeded in flipping votes; almost 20% of Moral Majority supporters had backed Carter in 1976.\n\nReagan, like Nixon, courted evangelicals. He spoke at Liberty University, which was an evangelical school run by Falwell. This became a tradition for Republican presidential candidates. Evangelicals liked the fact that Reagan favored a military buildup against the Soviets.\n\nIn 1980, Reagan won 67% of the white evangelical vote. In the election of 1984, Reagan managed to get an astounding 80% of white evangelical votes. The Republican Party began to feel it needed to win evangelicals.\n\nYet Reagan did not achieve many of the goals evangelicals set for his presidency. He appointed a Supreme Court justice who favored keeping abortion legal (Sandra Day O'Connor). He did not reinstate school prayer, or erect legal obstacles to gay rights. Yet evangelicals could not get the Democratic Party to do these things, so they kept voting Republican.\n\nIn short answer it is the evangelicals that causing the problems in the US.",

We oppose religious conceptions, but we do so with the understanding that the objective crisis is propelling masses of people into struggle against the system. The government\u2019s military aggression\u2014as well as the growing attacks on social programs and democratic rights\u2014will serve as profoundly revolutionizing forces in the coming period.\nhttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2007/03/reli-m09.html",

Christians like to pretend like they own helping the homeless and less fortunate, but they have to make sure you know that they are doing it, by plastering Jesus all over whatever helpful thing they are doing so you don\u2019t confuse them for secularists or any other religious group. \n\nChristians buy billboards and advertisements to try and make it seem like \u201cit\u2019s a sign\u201d from Jesus. Do the same but for more inclusive and secular messages. \n\nRealistically, evangelicals are all highly abused adults who only really know bullying as a motivation tool. Speak the language they know. Bully the politicians they want to vote for. If the politician they want to vote for seems like a huge loser and is embarrassing for them to their own friends and family, the less likely they will confidently boast voting for him OR the more unhinged they become in trying to commit to voting for him to normies, thereby delegitimizing them to said normies. \n\nI have a lot of ideas. I\u2019m implementing some rogue stuff in my own area. Stickers with slogans that will be pasted in high traffic areas, or the areas where the demographic might be more likely to vote against their own interests. Extremeists and conspiracy theorists like things in bite-sized information. They don\u2019t actually want to go \u201cdo research\u201d (no one does real research except actual scientists and researchers, they read articles and call that research) so make the messages short and easily digestible. \n\nGo out and volunteer for the politicians you want to win in your local area. Young people rarely do this. We need to make it cool and easy for young people to be politically motivated and less disenfranchised. You can make it cool but speaking THEIR language in your messaging. \n\nThere\u2019s gotta be some good books out there on this, I\u2019m just spit balling.",

Furthermore, like it or not, these evangelicals you complain about make up a huge portion of the working class in this country, and to effectively organize them will require engaging with their religious tradition in a way that is conducive to revolutionary ideals and not simply a paternalistic and condescending condemnation of everything they believe. Christianity has had reactionary elements in it since it started, and it has had equal parts revolutionary and egalitarian elements in it that have been in constant dialogue and tension with each other, and effective organizing will have to start with appealing to the latter rather than lumping the whole thing in as the former and writing these people off as hopelessly counter revolutionary and forever enemies.",

The problem is class conflict arising from the unequal distribution of material means, from the working masses being denied true power and connection to the means of production.\n\nThis conflict leads to the subjugation and alienation of the working class, who in turn imbibes the \u201copiate of the masses\u201d as a way to cope. The hoarding of resources by the bourgeoisie creates scarcity, which increases competition for limited resources remaining amongst the working class. This feeds into further conflict via scapegoating, racism, and every other type of divisive -ism, as working class individuals turn on one another in frustration over their lot. Inter-class conflict (which leads to intra-class conflict) resulting from class oppression is the cause. People just express frustration and justification of this conflict via religion.\n\nHonestly, this post is just more liberal bourgeoisie class-traitor propaganda, who just like us, are in their ignorance just trying to find a way to survive class oppression. Let\u2019s judge and shame our working-class brothers and sisters even more, so we can become even more divided and fragmented against the real enemy. It\u2019s what the ruling class wants. If you\u2019d even bother to speak with some of these \u201creligious rednecks,\u201d you\u2019d find they share many of the same frustrations about class struggle and the corporatocracy.
