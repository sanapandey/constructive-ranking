I have literally never seen any leftist talk about Putin positively. Is this just non-leftists mistakingly assuming Russia=communism or are there actual leftists who hold this opinion?\n\nEdit: After skimming the comments I\u2019ve sorta confirmed that my initial thoughts were correct: bored online people are making up a type of person to get mad at lol. If they do exist, they\u2019re way too rare for the amount of posts I see complaining about it.\n\ntl;dr: i need to stop using twitter ",

Imperialism is not just the seizure of territory, it is also the financial domination of nations through loans, the expropriation of resources etc. So yes Russia is doing some imperialism in Ukraine, the US is doing imperialism by using Ukraine as a proxy to stifle Russian economic growth. This isn't imperialist vs. victim, this is Imperialist vs. Imperialist by proxy. So I am against both Russia's invasion and US intervention in Ukrainian affairs that took Ukraine from an amicable trade partner to mortal enemies with Russia in a matter of 3 years. Here's a recommendation.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/",

I highly highly highly doubt they would have moved Nukes onto Ukrainian soil breaking the treaty signed in the 90s. But Putin decided Ukraine does not have the right to join Nato, and now with or without nato its just a matter of time before Ukraine develops Nuclear arms again. So i dont really think your point holds much water",

He wrote an essay about the necessity to restore the borders of the Russian empire, he gave a detailed and articulate, albeit insane, interview with Tucker Carlson explaining the centuries long historical claim he believes Russia has on the land.\n\nYou people think you can\u2019t qualify your leftist credentials without saying \u201cwait a minute NATO bad tho\u201d when any discussion of foreign imperialism is had.\n\nIt\u2019s fallacious, it\u2019s whataboutism, a tue quoque fallacy.\n\nThis war is about Russian irredentism and revanchism.

Zionists like to pretend like nothing happened before Oct. 7th and that it was an unprovoked attack out of nowhere so Israel had to respond. However the majority of us know that it was just another bit of reaction to the Israeli occupation going on since the 40s.",

The Maidan protests were the complete opposite of a coup, regardless of \u201cUS Intervention\u201d, which there is little evidence for. \n\nThe people voted in Yanukovych because they were confident he would sign the EU agreement, which was desperately needed by Ukrainians. Because despite what you say, this shit started wayyyyy before 2014. Putin has shown his imperialistic goals for Ukraine since he came to power in the 90s. Ukraine needed EU membership so they wouldn\u2019t become reliant on Russia\u2019s abusive relationship. \u201cAmicable trading partners\u201d, lmao. What a joke. \n\nThen, when Yanukovych decided to appease his Russian overlords, and not sign the agreement (even though it was on his desk, ready to be signed), the people were rightfully upset. Guess what they did? They protested, and they protested heavily. And then what happened? Yanukovych (possibly with the help of Russian KGB agents, not confirmed though) started shooting unarmed protestors. So, when Ukrainians (RIGHTFULLY) got angry at their comrades being killed, Yanukovych feared for his life and guess where he fled? Yep, right to his buddy Putin. \n\nYou are doing exactly what Israelis are doing right now. This shit didn\u2019t just randomly start in 2014 because of \u201cUS influence\u201d. Putin has always had his plans to invade former Soviet states ( see Chechnya and Georgia).",

None of that has happened. in any of my replies\"**\n\nYes, saying that Putin would have never attacked without the US influence in 2014 is actually, giving him credit. You didnt say \"I give him credit\", you just did.  \nIt is blindly believing what he says. He showed pretty clearly that he doesnt mind creating false narratives and attacking other countries and causing countless deaths for ressources.  \nIn good faith, no fucking person can say if they would have attacked or not.\n\nSaying that you support him was actually disingenuous on my end, and for that I will apologize. Sorry.\n\n**\"Your entire response was leaps in assumptions without any links\"**\n\nI would gladly fill in my leaps and assumptions, but you didn't point what they were. I suppose it's the points you mention after, hope this response will fill in the gaps for you.\n\nbtw,  just because your link has \"marxism\" in it, and is leftist, doesnt mean its correct. It's an analysis from 1916, the world changed quite a fucking lot since then, and few things said in it could be used for my point but w/e. Just because you posted a link doesnt legitimize what you say. You have to, you know, use what is said in it, show why it helps your point. Then, we can eventually discuss how legitimate or right is the text.\n\nAnd just because its in a link doesnt mean its true.\n\n\"**The comparison between Israel and Ukraine was in the response to perceived provocation. I.e. pretending that there was abolsutely no provocation to the Oct. 7th attacks is similar to pretending their was no provocation prior to the 2022 invasion\"**\n\nI see your p\u00e7oint, you were trying to do an analogy with the Israel situation.  \nHonestly, your logic is also pretty easy to compare the Zionist one. \"They did something before (2014 influence), so the answer is normal (fucking bombing the country)\".\n\nAnd not a single moment of consideration for the fact that it is a sovereign country attacking another.\n\nYou're so lost in \"I dont wanna align with any bad guy\", that you lose any sense of realism. In the end, the application of your logic ends with a win of russian imperialism. It simply ends with Putin taking the ressources he wanted, and all imperial forces seeing that they can attack weaker countries without repercussion.\n\n**\"is is not a comparison of military might or moral justifications, it is a comparison of liberal reaction and why we leftists should be more critical in our observations.\"**  \nHow is a comparison of liberal reactions supposed to be any kind of counter argument to me ? I'm not a liberal. I'm not supporting any liberal viewpoint. I also never said I support US imperialism, I actually said the opposite.\n\nAnother thing, you cannot simply omit the military strength aspect. Israel is much stronger than palestine, and Russia is much stronger than Ukraine. It is key in the discussion about imperialism. You have to talk about how strong countries impose themselves on weaker one when talking imperialism.\n\nThis thread is about the leftist vision of putin, what's the point of whataboutising about the USA ? Don't worry, I also am quite critical of the US imperialism, I said it already. It's just not the subject here.\n\nAnd when you're in cases like this one, where two imperalist forces use of their influence to wage a war over a third one, then MAYBE, we should start talking about... which country is sending thousands of soldiers to occupy the other country ?

More than likely though, thinking out loud, the only solution I see is Ukraine letting Crimea stay under Russian control so they can have their military bases and warm water port, but giving up any claim to the Donbass region, and then Ukraine getting to have EU or NATO partnership. \n\nUkraine being played by their own oligarchs is a basic statement, the larger scope is that they are being played by Ukrainian and US oligarchs. Why? Because both are making bank with weapons sales, massive financial loans, etc. These arms sales from the US aren't just the US taking stashes of weapons and delivering them. They buy weapons from a private US company and then have a private contractor in Ukraine distribute them. Same thing is happening on the Russian side so alot of the have a financial incentive for the war to continue.",

Although the US is starting to run low on ammunition reserves, which is part of why Trump wants to end the fighting. \n\nFew if any Russian oligarchs are actually benefitting from this war. Putin has been massively raising taxes on them to fund the war, at one point just killed several of them, and is forcing the banks to give loans to the defense sector that the defense sector will never be able to pay back. These loans are estimated to be in the 250-300 billion range. The only way to cover the losses would be to wipe out a lot of oligarchs savings. The defense sector itself is running at a constant loss, hence the need for these loans. This also leaves a pretty small amount of money that can be stolen as they are expected to keep production hold on target. At the same time wages in Russia are skyrocketing,  making the entire economy much less profitable for the owning class. The Russian oligarchs are being bled dry by this war because Putin's goals do not line up with theirs.",

Both as a way to make a lot of money and to cut off Russia from being the main supplier to Europe. The CIA openly sent arms and money to the far right and nazi groups and militias in Ukraine. Joe Biden's son was given a executive role in a Ukrainian natural gas company. Now all of these things pushed the normally Russian leaning president to consider a European trade deal over Russia. Russia answered back with a much better deal for trade and natural gas sales and the president accepted. This set off the Maidan protest/coup.

They are not having to draft people that is Ukraine. Russians have mandatory service so they do not have to draft. Weapons wise they are fine because they rebuilt some manufacturing plants with help from China. The west wants to believe that Russia is just using old Soviet weapons and war heads and then a few weeks ago Russia shot off a super sonic ICBM that was faster than the speed of sound and deadly precise.

Russia doesn't need a break, they are doing better than they were at the beginning. The Russian economy took a huge hit in 2014 and then further in 2022, but now is outpacing the US in growth thanks to BRICS. Russia is not as big bad and powerful as alot of Americans would think, but in the other direction it is a fully developed nation with advanced high tech weaponry and the best cyber warfare military group in the world, so they aren't someone to be underestimated.",

I was trying to get you to think. Why would the imperial power that very much wants full control of Ukraine want a ceasefire that does not get them full control of Ukraine when as you said. They are \"winning\"? Shouldn't you question their motive there?\n\n2. This is an empty statement that does not address anything i said. Appeasing dictators typically does not lead to peace. \n\n3. There is one mistake I wanna apologize for. Russia isn't drafting. I mixed my words up. You are right that Russia is a mandatory service country. What they've done is numerous mobilizations as the soldiers they did send kept dying. And as their soldiers now keep dying they will have to mobilize again. \n\nNow let's move on. Russia's loss of Soviet equipment is not debatable. We have video, photo, satellite evidence. Much of which is not sourced from the U.S so it can't really be the result of propaganda. Furthermore. No I don't think Russia's slow grinding assault is more successful than their lightning take over of Crimea or their brief rapid advance at the onset of current hostilities. \n\nNo Russia's manufacturing even with Chinese support is not enough to match their current needs. Again if so we would not see the prevelance of Soviet equipment on the Frontline.\n\nRussia outpacing the U.S in growth is just not true either. Inflation is terrible. Labor is short and Russia is now spending more on the military further shrinking other sectors of governmental spending that could stimulate the economy. \n\nAgain let me raise you the question.  And it's not rhetorical. I want your answer. If Russia is winning so hard why does Putin want a ceasefire? How would that benefit him when he could just sit back and have all of Ukraine as his proxy? \n\nI think my friend. You've bought a little to deeply into Russian propaganda.",

Every one of these \"traditional\" values that are espoused by the current government are legitimately popular in Russia. For example, homosexuality was not \"popular\" in the Soviet Union either, these are just facts. If you listen to him talk about this for example in Oliver Stone's interview series, he very clearly hints that although gay celebrities like Elton John are popular in Russia and although it's not a crime, it remains unpopular among the populace at large. Nevertheless, you'll find plenty of gay clubs in Russia's big cities.\n\nRussia still retains worker protections and benefits, some of which even the soc dem scandinavians don't beat. And to call this war imperialist is as disingenuous as what any liberal says. He tried for two decades to come to a security agreement with western Europe and the US, all the way up to January of 2022. Even when they went in, they went in with just enough manpower to force Ukraine to the negotiating table, which they were successful in until Boris Johnson went to Ankara and threw the agreement in the bin. \n\nIs it a lie that these regions in eastern Ukraine consider themselves Russian? \n\nNo, in fact go and ask people in Donbass whether they consider themselves Russian or Ukrainian and you'll often get \"Soviet\" instead. Note all the new Lenin statues which have gone up or been repaired after the AFU were pushed out.\n\nIs it a lie that Ukraine's government was overthrown and replaced by far right neo Nazi groups? \n\nNo, and even western media outlets covered this prior to 2022. Opposition parties including the communist party are banned along with the Orthodox Church. Bandera is hailed as a national hero along with other OUN members, and of course you have Azov and the rest. By the way, this has been decades in the making. Remember operation Gladio and Aerodynamic.\n\nIs it a lie that the post coup government has been shelling it's eastern population since 2014? \n\nNo, this was also covered by western media\n\nLiterally every motivation the Russians have given for this war is based on verifiable fact and it enjoys popular domestic support. This is not Putin's war, it belongs to the entire Russian political body and the criticism he receives from his domestic peers is that he didn't go in soon enough and even after it started, he's been too soft. If anything he has shown surprising restraint which you will never see of his western peers. Hence why the libs constantly spout this shit about Ukraine winning and the Russians being weak because they didn't level Ukraine in a week like they're used to seeing the US do to some poor Asian or Middle Eastern Nation.\n\nThe most critical you can be of him is that he isn't a communist, and that he was far too trusting of the west early in his tenure. He was the golden child of the neoliberals until they realized he wasn't going to let them balkanize Russia for their own corporate interests. In this sense, you can very well consider him left wing even if he isn't ideologically aligned in the way we would like. Otherwise, he's the one who stopped the firesale of state assets and pulled Russia out of its shock therapy nightmare. In that process, some oligarchs were expelled, imprisoned, perhaps some were executed. But the remaining ones have been kept in line, not disimilar from how billionaires in China work. \n\nBut let's not pretend that this war is some imperial ambition, much less a personal imperial ambition. If the events of 2014 had not occurred, even Crimea would still be a part of Ukraine. Which by the way, wasn't the first time they tried regime change. There were similar events in 2008, just unsuccessful.",

People tend to focus on his statements around Srebrinca but his statements about the Balkan wars generally are almost entirely noncritical of the Serbian narrative. Seriously, read what he writes at length about this and he does not even exercise any skepticism toward the perspective. He might couch his language but there\u2019s no critical analysis. \n\nThese are the two events which probably attract the most attention because they\u2019re pretty easy to cast as genocide denial. What really compounds them is that they\u2019re two decades apart and by the time of Srebrinca his lack of skepticism in Cambodia had throughly played out. That said, they\u2019re really the tip of the iceberg. Rather than simply be skeptical of US narratives and focus on them he actively praised the Khmer Rouge and specifically praised later discredited coverage. What was the need for either of the later two choices? Why did he not exercise the same skepticism of one narrative as the other. His whole philosophy in practice is excessively Manichaean. He\u2019s responded to mistakes with changes, but when evidence is limited he very reliably defaults to his simple dualist priors. It catches him flat footed repeatedly. \n\nA major contributing factor in this regard I strongly suspect is his lack of language expertise outside of English. He is principally consuming and reacting to English language reporting and is essentially ignorant of native language accounts elsewhere in the world unless and until they\u2019re translated. He\u2019s simply not well informed on most of these issues and unable to gather information without an intermediary. Rather than then cast a wide net for perspectives he very often follows one or very few and falls back on his priors. The deep irony of this is the good points he has made about media consumption. He\u2019s not exercising his very own advice and has failed to do so for decades. He\u2019s my go to example for death of the author. His overriding points are good but he himself is a failure in implementing his own prescriptions.",

It\u2019s honestly hard to imagine his prominence at the time and later without his commentary on Cambodia. \n\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that he was working on limited information but it\u2019s pretty weak since he actively rejected many sources in writing while enthusiastically embracing others which it takes the barest amount of skepticism to recognize as at least suspect. A better explanation is he was naive, but that put in doubt by his repetition of the error. You\u2019re right, he\u2019s only minimally addressed this issue since the 80\u2019s even the 70\u2019s. \n\nMy personal take is Chomsky is just too throughly American and too blind to that fact to recognize his limitations. So much of what he writes can be predicted and understood by a sort of American exceptionalism through a glass darkly. Honestly it\u2019s practically openly his central thesis.\n\nI don\u2019t understand people\u2019s attachment to him.

I've only listened to what he says and watched his actions, they usually line up with each other.\n\nI had not heard of Ivan Ilyin, but the first paragraph on his wiki says he was dismissed from his position for refusing to distribute Nazi propaganda and that he's a monarchist, ultra nationalist who's opposed to federalism and liberal democracy. Not so far from Solzhenitsyn. I suppose he's important enough in Russian history that the powers that be won't wash him away. I'd be interested to see what the Russian school curriculum actually says about him.\n\nRegardless, I don't know who the better alternative would have been. Zyuganov is a sell out even if he is a card carrying communist. And I still don't see how Russia can be considered imperialist at least since Soviet times. If this war happened in a vacuum and was actually \"unprovoked\" then sure, but it definitely wasn't. The Chinese gave the Russians a pass for this one despite adhering to the principles of Westphalia for a reason.",

Not going to provide any emotional reaction to Putin's actions but here are some facts that I find relevant for Marxist analysis of modern Russia and Putin's rule that would probably help you to get a more nuanced opinion:\n\n\\- In the early years of his rule (early 2000s) he gained a lot of popularity by declaring sort of war on oligarchs' influence and indeed according to most analysts oligarchs lost most of their influence on the most important decisions made by the Russian authorities  \n\\- However, only the oligarchs which opposed Putin's rule on political level (like Khodorkovsky) lost their assets; those who were wise enough not to oppose Putin politically kept most of the assets they acquired during 1990s privatization  \n\\- Some of Putin's long time friends became oligarchs (two of them among the most rich)  \n\\- Labor laws in Russia quite often take the side of workers: for example it's not easy at all to fire a worker if they don't want to leave. Enterprises with financial problems often keep their workforce because of that and pay the workers reduced salary for reduced work time (like 2 days a week).  \n\\- Little by little during Putin's rule a lot of industrial property was put under the state control; for example, the Russian state has controlling (and in some cases 100%) stake in: all railroads; the whole nuclear energy industry; the biggest oil company; the biggest natural gas company; a lot of electricity generation/distribution companies.  \n\\- The analysts consensus is that property rights in Russia aren't protected at all from takeover by the state actors or businesses affiliated with state (including Putin's friends I mentioned above); however every time property changes hands this way it's always done either through courts or by pressuring the owners to sell the property to a particular new owner; i.e. an effort is always made to at least make an impression of legitimate property transfer.  \n\\- Many industries are very consolidated with huge conglomerates often owning the majority of some industries' enterprises. This is often interpreted as a way for Putin's group to prevent uncontrolled groups of interests from forming and potentially threatening their power.\n\nI'm really interested in what people considering themselves Marxists would make of this; clearly it's state capitalism to a large extent but maybe someone has some special concepts to describe some of these facts and that I'd really appreciate to hear.",

If we consider the relation to the means of production the main drive of all social processes it's hard to explain.\n\nHowever if you consider relations of power at least a semi-autonomous system not necessarily strictly determined by relations to the means of production you understand very well why this situation exists: to stay in power Putin needs to balance the power associated with capital by some direct relationship with lower classes, sort of an \"alliance\" with them against elites or at least make an impression of such alliance.

A leftist critical of US and NATO hegemony might be tempted to see Russia as a necessary counterbalance. But this is a trap, given Russia\u2019s own blatant imperialism and colonial ambitions, as seen in Ukraine and its broader geopolitical strategies. Anti-imperialism, if it is to be a coherent principle, cannot selectively ignore the imperialism of non-Western powers; to say that it isn\u2019t imperialism is to misrepresent client states.    \n\n\n\nOne cannot harp on NATO or US imperialism by nature of its client states, like Israel, then say Russia isn\u2019t imperialist in Georgia and Moldova. Or brush off Ukraine and Chechnya as non-imperial actions.    \n\n\n\nAnother misleading position is the praise of Russia in the name of multipolarity. The idea of a multipolar world may appeal to leftists who reject US hegemony, but elevating Russia as a legitimate alternative ignores the fact that its own economic and political structures are *deeply reactionary*.    \n\n\n\nRussian oligarchic capitalism *does not* present a meaningful alternative to neoliberal hegemony\u2014it is simply another face of exploitation.    \n\n\n\nFinally, there is the nostalgic leftist\u2014the one who conflates modern Russia with the Soviet Union. This is an easy trap to fall into, given the aesthetic and rhetorical continuities Russia employs. *But modern Russia is not the USSR; it is an oligarchic, nationalist state that openly represses labor movements, dismantles socialist legacies, and weaponizes Soviet nostalgia to justify authoritarianism*.    \n\n\n\nNo doubt\u2014it can be easy to see how a leftist might examine Russia and come to a, rather perverted and twisted, version of leftist support.

            "body": "I think it\u2019s probably useful to ground this more in specifics. Germany is having an election this month and there is one party literally called the Left and another which is a relatively recent split from the former and abashedly leftist in its self-identification. If we cannot agree that these are leftists parties I think we\u2019re in some no true Scotsman type of argument. I will grant people that many people identify BSW as rightists in certain policy positions and that Sahra Wagenknecht herself has termed the ideology left conservatism  but the party itself grounds its positions in the ideology of the Left and/or the opinions of the working class. \n\nYou could argue at much more length about whether the SPD is meaningfully leftist, but another huge factor hanging over all of this is former Chancellor Schr\u00f6der\u2019s relationship with Russia, Putin, and Gazprom. Die Linke and BSW might be frustrated that an SPD chancellor turned quasi-oligarch should have any bearing on public perception of them but when they descend in large part from the SED and are more to the left in the common perception it\u2019s not a great leap of imagination for members of the public to imagine how cozy their leaders might be with Putin if given power. It\u2019s probably worth mentioning that the SED had a well-earned reputation before 1989 (especially in the 80\u2019s) for being closer to the Soviet Union than was typical in the Eastern Bloc. \n\nIt\u2019s important to start from making clear that both parties are first and foremost pro-peace and antiwar. From there though it\u2019s not that hard to see the BSW especially as pro-Russia and pro-Putin. Electoral politics mean that the BSW is increasingly distinguishing itself from the AfD by casting the latter as pro-US and itself as more pro-Russia. This is sensible electoral strategy but it definitely feeds into a perception of leftists as at least somewhat pro-Russia and pro-Putin. The Left meanwhile has a more nuanced take on Ukraine which more prominently centers a form of non-interventionist pacifism. \n\nWagenknecht\u2019s central argument is that dependence on Russian hydrocarbons is preferable to dependence on American hydrocarbons because they are cheaper. At its heart it is essentially agnostic as to the outcome of conflict in Ukraine and is concerned with it principally as an impediment to German prosperity.  I\u2019d say the core of these positions is not really pro-Putin or pro-Russia unless you see the war in Ukraine as a Russian invasion. If you have that position then by rejecting the relevance of that it\u2019s again sensible to at least see these policies as indifferent to wrongs by Putin and Russia and no great leap to see it as support. \n\nThe overall through line for the Left is the same despite a quite different position. The Party\u2019s first official position on Ukraine is support of its territorial integrity and support for its people\u2019s right to self defense. This is all couched in a broader message of pacifism and non-escalation. Specific policies then outline opposition to supplying weapons to Ukraine. This is a sensible position to have if the Party is first and foremost pacifist but it rather belies placing support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the defense of its people at the top of the policy. Putting aside whether it\u2019s practical to support the territorial integrity of Ukraine as a core position apart from the opinion of the Ukrainian people the policy is at best hollow and at worst hypocritical on its face. For a party and ideology in large part grounded in material analysis it should be entirely expected for at least some people to see the details of a policy failing to fulfill the leading slogans. Since the electoral campaign includes opposition to current German government policy and proposed changes to provide more aid to Ukraine it\u2019s again no great leap to see this as at least somewhat pro-Russia and pro-Putin. \n\nYou\u2019re right that neither party is crowing full throated support for Russia and/or Putin but it\u2019s not that hard to see a pro-Russian or pro-Putin bent to some of their policies. These are the largest Leftist parties in the most populous European state apart from Russia with a shot of getting into parliament (unless you also count the SPD and/or Greens). Their size is not as relevant as the fact that they are definitively not \u201cniche\u201d as they represent ~3-5% of voters each if polling is to be believed. \n\nMaybe you don\u2019t think these positions are meaningfully pro-Russia or pro-Putin at all, certainly many other replies don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s possible to reach a position which materially benefits Russia or Putin without any desire to do so. I understand that it might then be frustrating to have others characterize your position as pro-Russia and pro-Putin in response, but it\u2019s entirely sensible on their part. They cannot see what your motivations are but they can see what policies you support and what actions you take and who benefits from them. If Putin or Russia benefits, especially repeatedly or consistently, then it\u2019s very reasonable for them to conclude you are pro-Putin and pro-Russia. It might be objectively wrong, but it\u2019s an entirely sensible conclusion and cannot be refuted except by changing your position.",

Leftists in America have been created and nurtured with the same principles but using different strategies and traits.  You can check the USSR's '45 Communist Goals' to destroy capitalist America for reference.  Some of those goals include:\n\n22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American \\*\\*Communist cell was told to \u201celiminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.\u201d ...  23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. \u201cOur plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.\u201d  ...  \\*\\*24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them \u201ccensorship\u201d and a violation of free speech and free press.  ...  \\*\\*25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  ...  \\*\\*26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as \u201cnormal, natural, healthy.\u201d  ...  \\*\\*27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with \u201csocial\u201d religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need a \u201creligious crutch.\u201d  ...  \\*\\*28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of \u201cseparation of church and state.\u201d  ...  \\*\\*29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.  ...  \\*\\*30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the \u201ccommon man.\u201d  ...  \\*\\*31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the \u201cbig picture.\u201d Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.  ...  \\*\\*32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture\u2013education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.\n\nIt is easy to see the embodiment of many of these goals in America today as they are associated with and championed by leftists.  For example, the U.S. is overwhelmingly the largest creator and consumers of porn (#25).  Or (#23) promoting and consuming meaningless art:  Duct-taped banana sells for $6.2 million at art auction - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIL7pDeSj8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIL7pDeSj8s)  \n\nSo, the journey is different whether it's in Russia, Europe, America, or elsewhere.  But the fight is the same...and the goal is the same.  \n\n\n#",

It's been getting worse and worse. Russia has been using troll farms for years now to flood the internet with outright lies and fabricated stories. The far right in the US and in European countries also does this, and it's taken epic propertions with social networks like Instagram, Facebook and X. X is nothing but a cesspool of extremists, AI agents told to behave in different ways, Russians that have been successfully manipulating people and elections for years. On AI agents, check for instance Eliza. It's so easy nowadays to deploy bots.\n\nI am almost certain that these \"pro-Russian communists\" you've been speaking to on X were agents that werd told to behave that way. Keep in mind that tech billionnaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk (who owns X) and Bezos (owns the Washington Post and other media), have been in on this. The American far right, represented by the Republican Party, MAGA and the Heritage Foundation are extremely dangerous, loaded with money and very powerful. They are filled with hatred and they have a terrifying agenda for the United States.\n\nDon't let them fool you.",

They\u2019re still a hyper-capitalist state that flirts with Nationalist politics and despite what CNN or Fox News say, Putin doesn\u2019t want a new Soviet Union.

They are familiar with its historical and present evils as an empire and so they tend to default to opposing all its actions. Naturally when the united states actively starts to arm a country the reaction is going to be that they have selfish motivations that will be bad for the people in the region. And to a degree this is true. \n\nThe United States is using Ukraine. Russia has long been a staunch opponent to the united states seeking to usurp their prominent position on the world stage. The war in Ukraine allowed the United States a rather unique opportunity to absolutely devastate the Russian Military, economy, government without having to lift a finger. Hell it even let the military offload some out of date equipment. \n\nHowever what leftists are missing is despite the United States Motives being characteristically selfish it is at the same time beneficial to Ukraine. Let me explain. \n\nI've seen people suggest a ceasefire is a clean and easy solution here. It's the right answer for leftists to support. This is not a bad thing to support but it is naive. A ceasefire will not end this conflict. It will simply allow a badly hurt russian army to reorganize reqeeuip then launch a knew more capable invasion into Ukraine. One which will result in even more cataclysmic death than we see now. \n\nFurthermore this is not an equal war. This is Putin's war. If today he simply negotiate terms to leave Ukraine and for Ukraine to leave Kursk then the war would be over. This is not some unfortunate senseless conflict in which the governments of two uncaring nations sacrifice their people for pride. It is one man's war. One man's imperialist invasion. \n\nMake no mistake. Russia is a far right empire. One built on the oppression of countless people most westerners have never even heard of. The people of Russia have been carefully primed with years of propaganda to stomach this war if not outright support it. This is as clear cut as Israel and Gaza. One side must be stopped and that side is Russia.",

Observers point out that through the last 20 years of his power, the material living conditions of the average Russian has gotten much better. \n- He is a no bullshit guy as opposed to politicians in the west.  Orban noted that Russia always sticks to a deal, whereas you can't rely on the EU or the US in the long term. \n- While I don't support Russia in the Ukraine war, I do consider it started in 2014 and was very much provoked. \n- As much as the media portrays him as a dictator, he's actually done a lot of work to work with other people, including getting the oligarchs under control.\n- There are many leaders in Russia that are far more war hawk than Putin. \n\nSo basically, I don't approve of him, but I think given the current capitalist system and extreme wealth concentration he's a better leader for Russia than any leader we have in the west is for us, as they only serve big money.  He's also been forced to subtly appreciate some socialist tendencies to keep approval ratings high and keep corruption lower, even though in his \"history lessons\" he obviously likes Tsarist Russia.\n\nRussia is also helped by the government having main control over the central banks, which is an important leftover from socialist times that has been ultra important as the financial colonialism of the west was limited. \n\nConsidering his main alliances such as North Korea and China he's not against socialism per se in the same rabid way as the West. He's a pragmatist. \n\nHe is an oligarch himself, incredibly rich, so that counts against him.  But I try to be accurate in my assessment and not buy into Western hate/propaganda.",

                    "body": "You say you're not behind Putin, then support him by propagating lies for him.  \n\nFirst, polls in Russia are never close to accurate.  I know Russian families living in Belarus and Ukraine (western).  They privately say they don't like him but publicly say that his is a good leader.  Their relatives living in Russia are the same (except, I'm told, those relatives would never admit it to anyone but close family).  \n\nSecond, Putin is a master of \"bullshit.\"  He's a KGB operative at heart.  I wonder if Orban realizes that Russia had a treaty with Ukraine that Putin has violated twice.  Russia and Putin regularly break treaties.  Just like all other countries do - including European countries and the U.S.  \n\nYou said Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was \"provoked.\"  Yet another Putin lie and you parrot it to support him.  NATO was at Russia's borders long before he used that lie/propaganda to invade Ukraine.  And that's just scratching the surface of the lies Putin spreads to claim it was \"provoked.\"\n\nAlso, how exactly do you equate \"he's actually done a lot of work to work with other people, including getting the oligarchs under control.\"?  How does that disqualify him from being a dictator?  Getting rid of powerful opponents - which Putin is always doing - is a core trait of dictators.  Dictator Xi in China has done it time and time again as well.\n\nYou go on to assert that Putin doesn't serve 'money':   \"...given the current capitalist system and extreme wealth concentration he's a better leader for Russia than any leader we have in the west is for us, as they only serve big money.\"   Then later you state that Putin is an oligarch.  So, Putin has become an oligarch which he achieved working as a -public servant- most of his life, but he -doesn't- serve big money like the leaders in the west do.  The detachment from logic and truth there is astounding.  By some estimates, Putin is one of the richest men in the world.  All of which he stole from Russian citizens and the oligarchs he got rid of.  And that makes him a \"better leader\" than western countries have.  Wow.  Just wow.  Then you even note that his main alliances are socialist/communist North Korea and China - both of which are also run by oligarch dictators who became incredibly rich by stealing from their citizens.\n\nSeriously, your overt support for Putin by not being behind him has made my head spin.  \n\nPutin stated that the worst event in modern history was the fall of the Soviet Union.  He has stated that he wants to reestablish the Soviet Union.  Putin is, and always has been, a communist.",

A corrupt, murderous KGB-strongman who's desire is to rebuild one of the history's most oppressive regimes.  I actually don't like referring to it as the USSR since many of the \"Republics\" were occupied vassal states that didn't have a choice in joining.\n\nBut my overall assertion stands true based on analysis of each of the topics.  At best your opposition to Putin came across as a classic, apologist narrative:  \"I don't support him, BUT...\"",
