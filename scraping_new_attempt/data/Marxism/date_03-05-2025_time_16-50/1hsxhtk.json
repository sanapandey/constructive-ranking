    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m looking for book recommendations on Marxist / Communist Degrowth and ecology. I\u2019ve already read Kohei Saito\u2019s Marx in the Anthropocene, Jason Hickel\u2019s books as well as a few books by Andre Gorz and Ivan Illich. \n\nI know that ecology and Degrowth can be a divisive issue within Marxist circles, but I\u2019m looking to expand my understanding of the topic. Anything is helpful! \n\n",

            "body": "I think it is very important to read \"Austerity Ecology\" by Leigh Philips. His work is anti degrowth. I don't agree with all of his points, but it is a must read for those wanting to understand all sides of the debate. Bear in mind that it was written in 2015, so some things are a little outdated - but as Marxists we are used to reading dusty stuff, so I'm sure you'll manage",
