    "selftext": "I\u2019m in a small, closed economy where I initially charged less than others for a product to stay competitive. Cigarettes specifically. After a while, I raised my prices to match what others were charging (already overpriced in my opinion). Eventually, I became the only seller of this product and a sort of organic monopoly formed in the space.\n\nNow I\u2019m making a significant profit, but I\u2019m wondering, from a Marxist perspective, is this behavior exploitative? I\u2019m not profiting off anyone\u2019s labor directly, but by taking advantage of scarcity and market demand, I\u2019ve become the sole provider. I haven\u2019t raised prices since.\n\nIs this just a natural outcome of working within a capitalist system, or am I reinforcing exploitative dynamics by charging a premium in a market where people have limited options? I\u2019m seeking advice on whether what I\u2019m doing is ethically problematic in a Marxist framework or if it\u2019s simply how these markets function.\n\nI know that Marx says surplus value doesn\u2019t come from overcharging, but rather the exploitation of one\u2019s labor. But I am making a significant profit and do feel a little guilty with how much people are willing to pay for this product.",

Cigarettes specifically.\n\nYou are describing a prison commissary. Vendors pay the prison a large percentage of their sales in exchange permission to sell to a captive population. You therefore receive the right to charge whatever  exploitative price you want for your product. This is monopoly capitalism.\n\n>Now I\u2019m making a significant profit, but I\u2019m wondering, from a Marxist perspective, is this behavior exploitative?

I haven\u2019t raised prices since.\n\nAs a middleman you are adding no value to your product. You are buying in bulk from a wholesaler, and reselling individually  at a greatly increased price to people who have little or no choice of supplier. This  is creating an arbitrarily increased cost to the purchaser, not adding value through labor. Nothing in the labor theory of value includes this kind of exploitation. You are in fact \"profiting off anyone's labor,\" the labor which created the real value by manufacturing the cigarettes. No one who actually created the value of your product benefits from your monopoly pricing. This is the opposite of Marxist economics.",

From a Marxist perspective, it\u2019s true that exploitation traditionally refers to profiting off labor\u2014surplus value coming from paying workers less than the value they create.   \n  \nSince you\u2019re not directly employing anyone, you\u2019re not exploiting labor in that classical sense. However, the fact that you\u2019ve become the sole provider in a small economy could still raise questions about power dynamics and fairness.   \n  \nMonopoly power, even if it arises organically, concentrates economic control in a way that limits choice for others, which Marxists often critique.\n\nThat said, the tension here is interesting. You\u2019re operating within a capitalist system, which naturally incentivizes profit and efficiency, and now you\u2019re questioning whether the very tools that brought you success\u2014like responding to scarcity and market demand\u2014are ethically problematic.   \n  \nIn a way, this mirrors a broader irony: many Marxists participate in and even benefit from capitalist systems while critiquing them. The question becomes, if you\u2019re operating within a system that\u2019s designed this way, how much responsibility lies with you as an individual versus the system itself?   \n  \nIt\u2019s something Marx himself grappled with when thinking about reform versus revolution.\n\nUltimately, the ethical question isn\u2019t just whether you\u2019re exploiting labor, but whether your monopoly reinforces the inequalities that Marxists critique.   \n  \nIf you feel uneasy about it, there are ways to address that\u2014perhaps by lowering prices, creating a sliding scale, or reinvesting profits back into the community.  \n  \n But it\u2019s worth reflecting on how many self-described anti-capitalists end up relying on the mechanisms of market economies when those systems naturally create opportunities or benefits.  \n  \n It\u2019s an interesting paradox\u2014despite criticisms, the flexibility and responsiveness of free markets often provide solutions or advantages that are difficult to replicate in alternative systems.   \n  \nEven those who aim to challenge capitalism can find themselves leaning on its tools because of how effectively it adapts to meet demands and allocate resources.",

I don't want to walk to Raleigh (cig brand BTW) NC, or Durham (cig brand BTW) NC to get my smokes. Middleman saved me labor of having to walk to NC.\n\nIn \"economics,\" there is \"transaction cost:\" how much does it cost you in time and effort to engage in a transaction, such as buying a pack of smokes? Middlemen reduce transaction costs.\n\nA money-saving strategy is to try to only spend cash, and no credit cards - partly because we do mot really recognize the money flowing away from us with CC versus cash, but also b/c credit card is easier to use than cash.\n\nAnd, apparently, sliding hte CC was too much work, so we got the insert-slot. And that was too much work so now we have tap.\n\nNext, we will just have a chip planted under our skin at our hand. To lead to adoption of this, though, they will phase out and ban other forms of payment.",

I\u2019m in the process of reading Capital and trying to relate the concepts to my own experiences. I see your point about the arbitrary cost increase, but I also wonder if the labor I\u2019m putting into rolling the cigarettes might qualify as a form of added value in a different sense, perhaps through convenience or craft. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this perspective as I work through these ideas in Capital. Thanks for sharing your analysis!",
