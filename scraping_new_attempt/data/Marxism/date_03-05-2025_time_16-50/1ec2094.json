That being the case, we must recognise that in most continental countries the lever of revolution will have to be force; a resort to force will be necessary one day in order to set up the rule of labour.\" - Karl Marx, La Liberte speech to the IWMA, 1872.",

It does mean that we try to take politics a bit more seriously than what you would find on r/politics.\n\nThe United States political system is a direct product of American bourgeois society. The two major political parties are funded by the same people who own the media. That media only takes those two parties seriously when it reports the news so for the majority of people they become the only two viable parties. \n\nThat same class of people that fund the political system and own the media organized our educational system where we are taught that those are the only historically relevant  parties. \n\nBecause those parties are the only two that win elections consistently because they are the only ones taken seriously by the bourgeois class we learn that they\u2019re the only parties that can make any material difference for us. \n\nSo for most people who actually vote, the Green Party is just some other party you can vote for.\n\nSo you can spend your life trying to get people to vote Green Party. If you are successful then the Green Party will just become the new party funded by the bourgeois class. Because this shit is systemic. \n\nIt\u2019s a system designed a certain way by a class to produce roughly the results that they want. Thats why this isn\u2019t about voters having enough brains to vote the correct way. They are voting the correct way based on their upbringing, education, media consumption habits, economic conditions, life experience etc, just like you. All those things taught you to vote green, just like all my experience taught me to vote blue, but then I became a Marxist. Now I try to apply Marx and Engels dialectical materialist analysis to policial/economy.",

Leftists participate in elections for as long as workers actually see them as important and have faith in them but they are subordinated to the other work and easily abandoned. Socialists following a revolutionary platform will never be elected into a position of power and never be able to carry out their program from this position in a capitalist state. \n\nIt\u2019s anti Marxist to denigrate US voters for being uneducated as per their class interests. Your entire role as a Marxist is to educate workers and understand the structural reasons for alienation and having illusions in capitalist superstructures. It\u2019s actually pretty revolting that you\u2019d denigrate the oppressed for \u201cnot having the imagination and thinking skills.\u201d You\u2019re not some enlightened elite smarter than everyone else. \n\nThe greens are really not that important. They won\u2019t change anything structurally, they aren\u2019t anti capitalist, they don\u2019t have a working class basis. Vote for them if you want, voting itself is not the way we see change happening.",
