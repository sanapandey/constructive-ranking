    "selftext": "Title might seem bit vague (apologies I'm overall very new to general Marxist discussion and materials) but I'll do my best to elaborate. I've moved left as years have gone by, and have most recently been engaged in literature that have pushed me this direction; not theory, but books like *The Jakarta Method*.\n\nI've since over the past year been trying to engage properly with Marxist Theory and discussions of such, but one thing that's thrown me through a loop are the branches from Marx and Engel's analysis, and criticism/discussion of said branches - both from other schools of thought, and to some extent from non-Marxists.\n\nObviously it's healthy to discuss and debate certain ideas, and likely it's my general lack of knowledge that's throwing me so much, but it can be hard to make heads or tails on certain things.\n\nOne obvious divide I can ascertain is Trotskyism against Marxist-Leninism and how that's divided a bunch of small communist parties in the UK, but left communism is something I've come more familiar with over the past year too, and how they differ with/criticise Lenin, Stalin and Mao (as well as MLs critcising left-coms) makes me feel in over my head on trying to understand what's going on.\n\nEspecially recently I've followed a small community of creators on Insta who are Maoists, and I picked up the *Basic Principles of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism* as a primer to better understand the philosophy. But then I did some further research on this particular school of thought - learning that MLM originated from Peru fascinated me and I wanted to learn more - and then I ultimately ended up on a reddit thread discussing it, which seemed to share a consensus that MLMs are dogmatic, deride other Marxists (which did seem the case for one particular person I follow) and haven't achieved anything. And now ultimately I just feel more confused than anything.\n\nI think the issue might be my perception, I probably sound like an idealogue and I don't want to come across as nor be one (nor do I think following a school of thought makes you one either); but I'm just trying to get some general bearings of Marxist analysis, and I've ended up in a position where I feel like most positions taken in the umbrella are criticised for one reason or another, so I don't really know what to do (beyond getting a base understanding of class analysis).\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the input and suggestions; general consensus is to move towards the works of Marx and go from there, which is aided by the list of resources also recommended. Thank you once again \ud83d\udc4d",

You should find a reading list online that consists of the well known theorists (Marx, Engles, Lenin, Luxemburg, Trotsky, Stalin, Moa, ECT) so that you can get a general understanding of the ideology so that you can actually understand the differences between them. Because they can be quite hard to understand without a decent understanding of Marxism.\n\nAlso I would suggest you don't get to emotionally attached to the \"identity\" a tendency has. Rather you should commit to a tendency that you agree with theoretically and more importantly believe is the correct interpretation. Because that's what actually matters. Far more than aesthetics. \n\nYou can find a lot of Marxist works on the Marxist Internet Archive and a lot of readings of Marxists works on the YouTube channel Socialism 4 All. He has several study guides read out and put in chronological order in playlists. So you can use that too.",

They are the most important, and you should have an in-depth understanding of those three theorists before moving on to the others that came later. By doing this, you understand the most important theory of Marxist work, which lets you critique whether other, later theorists actually aligned with Marxist tendencies or not. Just start with Marx Engels and Lenin",

Both are fantastic books for beginning, as that's what they were written for: new members of the CPI(Maoist) and the CPP (respectively).\u00a0\n\n\nAs a Maoist, I do have recommendations for some books that shed SOME light on your question, specifically from J. Moufawad-Paul (Canadian Maoist philosopher).\u00a0\n\n\n1. \"Communist Necessity\" serves as his theoretical \"hey we should be concerned about how we organize because not everything is going to work\";\n\n\n2. \"Continuity and Rupture\" makes the argument that Maoism should be considered the latest and greatest in the theory of Marxism, and does this by analyzing itself in relation to Leninism (mostly, but he does have his essay \"Maoism or Trotskyism?\" as an Appendix);\n\n\n3. \"Critique of Maoist Reason\" traces the various lines of thought within the Maoist milieu, arguing that certain versions (e.g. the \"Gonzalo-Thought\" kind, Maoist third-worldism, etc) are incorrect based on what Maoist groups are making the most practical progress;\n\n\n4. \"Politics in Command\" returns to the idea of organizing in general, and is an up-to-date attack against the various manifestations of Economism that Lenin wrote about in \"What Is To Be Done?\" and how those manifestations are handled in Maoist theory.\n\n\nAs you can tell, these are all from the Maoist point of view, and I personally found them convincing, but I do believe other Marxist tendencies can still glean helpful information from these books even if they don't consider themselves maoists.\u00a0\n\n\nI reference these in particular because it's an attempt at understanding a more recent tendency in Marxism (originating in the late 80s and early 90s, but still actively being developed). You can contrast that with people writing about Leninism, which you can read about with things like \"Foundations of Leninism\" by Stalin or \"Long Live Leninism!\" by the Communist Party of China back in the 60s.\u00a0\n\n\nPlus, you can get the PDF for everything I mentioned except Continuity and Rupture by the publisher, Foreign Languages Press, so pretty accessible imo",

They have a book coming out sometime soon, either after the new year or before, that is the next chapter of that textbook on Historical Materialism. This book should be required reading for all comrades. It syntheses the writings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin into a cohesive philosophical world view.

            "body": "Is there some particular reason that you want to understand the different schools that isn't motivated by historical or anthropological interests? Are you trying to find your coordinates in some Marxist space so that you can identify all your deviationist enemies? That's definitely fun when you're young and full of piss and vinegar, but it's not the most productive way to live your life. If you want a tracing of the history, the standard is still Kolakowski's *Main Currents of Marxism*, with the obvious proviso that Kolakowski is not a particularly sympathetic interpreter of Marxism\u2014and a not particularly impressive philosopher. If you want to study abstract and austere theory, then most schools have their founding texts. But I would suggest it's more helpful for sorting the various Marxisms if you focus on some relevant social phenomenon and see how differently it can be interpreted.\n\nFor example, if your sympathies are with some kind of third-worldism, you might have an interest in various Marxist interpretations of capitalist transition, specifically agrarian transition. You could peruse articles from *The Journal of Agrarian Studies* or *The Journal of Peasant Studies* and chase down citations, or you could read the various contributions to *The Brenner Debate*. You could also read *The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism* and try to grapple with the differences between Sweezy and Dobb's positions. This is, I would suggest, the best way to grapple with the various interpretations of historical materialism. That's a natural jumping off point into dependency theory and world systems theory.\n\nIf your interest is in different interpretations of conditioning and subject formation, you'll have to move through Western Marxism, Structuralism, and the Frankfurt School. For the latter, I would recommend not starting with things like *Negative Dialectics* or *The Dialectic of Enlightenment*, but with Adorno's lectures published by Polity: *Philosophy and Sociology*, *An Introduction to Dialectics*, and *Philosophical Elements of a Theory of Society*. And then you may find, as many have, that you're not sympathetic to the Frankfurt school because Adorno is kind of a fusty killjoy, Habermas is more a liberal political theorist, and the rest are overly concerned with the Freudian death drive. So you take what you need and you leave the rest.\n\nFinally, I don't mean this to sound didactic, but you're allowed to read bourgeois philosophers and bourgeois political theory. It doesn't follow that to be a Marxist is to cloister yourself amongst only Marxism-stamped work. Hell, I would say that reading Foucault made me more sure of the general thrust and theoretical and methodological commitments of Marxism than reading even Capital. Obviously against Foucault's intentions. Also, and it can't really be stressed enough, be *charitable* when interpreting the work of scholars and be skeptical of dogmatism. (And if you like Bevins, *If We Burn* is fodder for so many intra-marxian disputes. Though it's more an indictment of anarchist organizing principles.) Anyway, as a general rule, I almost always recommend people start with, or at  least look at the non-theory first: for example, if you have access to the MECW (and we all do....), some of Marx's articles for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and his articles about the US Civil War make his theories easier to comprehend than reading Capital or the Grundrisse. You can also see how he tries to make sense of recalcitrant data. Maybe some of this will be useful to you. Maybe not.",
