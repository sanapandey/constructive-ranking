China, Vietnam, Cuba, etc. are \"communist\" in the sense that they are predominantly controlled by people who call themselves communists, but they are not stateless, moneyless societies where goods are distributed according to need. \n\nThese countries became controlled by communists, I and Lenin would argue, because it was much easier for communists to gain power there. These were semi-periphery countries which were not yet fully integrated into the global capitalist system, so there was less organized resistance to them gaining power. \n\nHowever, these countries did not have the industrial capacity to transition to something resembling communism as you point out, so they were forced to adopt capitalist models of development under a communist ethos of government (socialism). \n\nWhen I look at the modern imperial core countries, I see those disillusioned working class people who are falling further and further behind, and a desire to go beyond capitalism. In other words, Marx isn't proven wrong simply because the developments he predicted have not yet come to fruition. All the necessary preconditions around class consciousness and industrial development have to be fulfilled to determine if the predictions are correct, which I believe we are closely approaching.",

I don't know if Marx accounted for it, I haven't read every single one of his works.\n\nOr more accurately, as you pointed out, they just didn't have the time scale right. The industrial revolution seemed dystopian to them at the time (and for many working people, it was) but as it turned out, the stratification of society that socialism aims to mitigate isn't really useful as long as resources are infinite. If the workers only get 10% of the pie but they'll *always* get 10% of the pie, revolutionary energy can be diffused. That's what happened in the mid-twentieth century. Workers gained a little bit and the organizing energy of the first half of the century died (in the West at least, obviously there were other, outside pressures being exerted on the Socialist Block of the East).\n\nNow, as the water starts running out, the land is all claimed and food becomes more difficult to grow, while energy requirements explode, those contradictions we talked about 150 years ago are becoming more and more obvious to everyone.",

In other words, while the question isn't quite accurate, Marx was still wrong in his belief of the transition from State power to help the working class. Lenin and Mao are the best examples where we *know* these people believed in descriptive Marxism and they believed in prescriptive communism. However, the transition from the State to the people never happened because it doesn't appear that the workers wanted it. It might be because they are short-sighted, but it also might just be that the working class did not find communism desirable. Whatever the case is, Marx (and Lenin) was wrong that the there would be a transition from the State to communism.\n\nI also disagree immensely with:\n\n>All the necessary preconditions around class consciousness and industrial development have to be fulfilled to determine if the predictions are correct, which I believe we are closely approaching.\n\nThere is a reason why Mao's successors gave up on class consciousness. They are still very committed to socialism, but by means of practicality, no longer was it about philosophy or morality. I believe them to be sincere in their admiration of Marx, Lenin, and Mao, but the push for market reform and abandonment of communism stems from practicality because even *they don't believe* in the philosophical arguments made by Marx.",

I think its pretty clear in Marx and Lenin\u2019s works that there was no \u201cprediction\u201d that the bourgeoise state would help the working class beyond giving concessions to prevent revolution. And if you mean already existing socialist states I would say increasing quality of life by industrializing is their active attempt to improve the lives of the proletariat (as bad as conditions are in Special Economic Zones, the decline of poverty in China is pretty impressive). Obviously all have extremely convoluted histories and there\u2019s a lot to be skeptical / critical of such as Dengist Reforms, NEP, Great Purges, etc. But I think its clear no state has achieved a stateless, classless society yet but its pretty tough to do when facing constant foreign intervention from the most powerful global superpowers as every socialist project to date as had to deal with.\n\nWith regard to your last point, socialism is meant to be scientific. It should be detached from moralism. Marx\u2019s theory hinges on the idea that historical precedence has been set for there to be an eventual proletariat revolution against the bourgeoise given previous massive class upheavals throughout history (like from monarchism to mercantilism/capitalism). Market reforms have occurred in almost all socialist states because it is hard to operate in a completely non privatized way in the current global geopolitical environment (or in material conditions that had just been ravaged by ww1, a revolution, and foreign invasion in the case of the early USSR). Only time will tell if China for example begins to actually nationalize industries and begin transitioning away from private markets and into a more traditional socialist state and perhaps one day a communist one. I will concede there likely needs to he a shift towards multi polarism for this to happen, but thats a whole other can of worms. Ultimately though these are all experiments that should be studied and critiqued\u2026",

Like obviously he was completely off on the timeline already, and on capitalist crises growing more and more severe. I don't see any evidence of a workers revolution and increasingly capitalist societies are moving towards white collar work that less and less fits his conception of the economy and seem less prone to a revolution than ever. Yeah there is a lot of stuff online about a \"capitalist dystopia\" or \"late stage capitalism\", but I don't see this emerging as some coherent workers movement, it's just a fringe activist left that happens to be in vogue online rn.\n\nSome of his predictions seem correct on a surface level but the underlying mechaism is almost never the one he predicted. Like increased inequality is happening  (though it is falling globally) but most of this change isn't driven by accumulation of capital but by a divide between unskilled and skilled labour. That's not to mention the fact that inequality was decreasing for a long time in capitalist societies.\n\nIt seems like what Marx was predicting mostly played out until capitalist societies made required adjustments and were able to stave off the collapse Marx predicted and that we are pretty clearly able to say Marx was wrong about how stuff would play out. Not that I think he wasn't a valuable thinker, honestly it's kinda freaky how right he was about certain things: I just think we've left that period behind.",

Also, crises would only get more severe from the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, which can be temporarily reversed by a variety of things (increasing workforce size, increase in the rate of exploitation, reduction in taxation on capital, etc.). \n\nMost people won't acknowledge revolutionary potential until they see it acting in front of their face. It's out there, ya gotta go find it. I can pick up a conversation with a new coworker on every day on how the economy should be democratized, which would have labelled me a dirty pinko thirty years ago. \n\nWhite collar work fits clearly within his conception of proletariat, which you would know if you read Marx's work. White collar workers provide more value to the company than they are paid in monetary value, so they are part of the proletariat. \n\nInequality is not falling globally, you're gonna wanna check your sources on that. Poverty may be reduced in China exclusively, but everywhere else is still suffering the same or worse. \n\nThe most skilled workers you will find are paid 6-7x what your typical worker is. Billionaires often gain hundreds or even thousands of times more than that, the distinction between skilled vs unskilled is trivial in comparison. \n\nInequality did decrease for a time within specific societies because of the rise of a class conscious group of workers who gained influence on the levers of power. That power has waned, to the point where the same underlying capitalist structures have taken over again to increase inequality. Marx does not say that equality will always decrease under capitalism, just that capitalism always works to increase inequality. There can be countervailing trends. \n\nI'm seeing increased financialization, increasing inequality, corporations struggling to make a profit without massive subsidies in many cases, and class consciousness is rising. Nearly identical problems to that which Marx identified are becoming key issues to economic progress. Saying that Marx's predictions haven't been true because of the development of a welfare state is like saying a bouncy ball won't fall down the stairs because it just bounced up in the moment.

If anything, we have much the opposite. Marx observed that capitalism was progressive in the sense that it was the first time in history societies had \"abundance,\" meaning enough for everyone. However, people still starved and languished under poverty and unemployment because that vast abundance was controlled by only a handful of owners who, not only never had \"enough\" in the sense that they were greedy, but 1) didn't even really have the option of being generous because then other competitors could put them out of business by running their operations more ruthlessly efficient, and 2) we see that having abundance isn't really enough for many of these people either: they enjoy wielding power over people, purchasing and disposing of people like commodities to be consumed a la Epstein and many others of his ilk, and they'd have to give up treating people as themselves commodities for society to achieve \"post-scarcity.\" Or, they could simply want more land to themselves and let vast swathes of people die (or just let the population decline gradually) until only their clique and the managers of automatons are left so they can just inherit the earth in a Malthusian \"degrowth\" sort of move.\n\nFurthermore, capital is coming to a point where it retards technological development more than it spurs it. More and more we're seeing companies slash their R&D budgets in favor of stock buybacks and dividends to shareholders so the owners can just enrich themselves. We're seeing tech development slow down a lot in the West, with the greatest strides being made in the PRC.\n\nSo the answer here is would Marx be proven wrong? Yes, but Marx wasn't a prophet pulling divine revelations out of the sky, he was a ruthlessly critical analyzer of the conditions of his time and the logic through which they were developing across history. That's not to say he hadn't been incorrect on some things, but I'd argue as time goes on he's only become more and more vindicated, and that more often than not the logic he used to arrive to his conclusions was sound. And on the flipside, there's not much reason to think that some post-scarcity technological miracle under capitalism is inevitable. It'd logically require a radical change in the social relations of society around production. A \"revolution\" you might say, where the masses finally \"seize the means of production.\"\n\n>Like increased inequality is happening (though it is falling globally) but most of this change isn't driven by accumulation of capital but by a divide between unskilled and skilled labour.\n\nThis is patently false. The owners of capital make your average software dev in Silicon Valley look homeless by comparison.\n\nWatch this video, and keep in mind it was made 11 years ago, and the situation has *only gotten worse*: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&t=11s&pp=ygUcd2VhbHRoIGluZXF1YWxpdHkgaW4gYW1lcmljYQ%3D%3D\n\n>That's not to mention the fact that inequality was decreasing for a long time in capitalist societies.\n\nIt was decreasing because 1) a militant labor movement made it happen, and those gains in the '30-'40s have been getting slowly rolled back ever since, and 2) imperialism really took off in which capitalists in the West basically outsourced the most intense forms of exploitation to the Global South where they would be the farmers and sweatshop workers producing cheap goods and food for the imperial core countries.",

In Marx\u2019s lifetime, workers controlled Paris during a war and social crisis. After Marx\u2019s death, Germany had the world\u2019s biggest socialist party. There were revolutionary movements and mass labor movements in industrial countries. It seems like you may just have a lack of knowledge of this history - it\u2019s generally not taught in schools, at least where I am in the US.\n\n2. Revolution in Russia was a surprise to most and it was very contentious because the working class was a minority. But it was a mass revolution and the only options once in a revolution is going forward or acting as a reactionary eventually (I\u2019d say the Bolsheviks of the revolution went forward, but as the revolution was lost they did start to take the reactionary path by the early 20s and certainly by the Spanish revolution the USSR acted against social revolution.\n\n3. China, Cuba and Vietnam were ultimately national liberation movements. None of these revolutions involved working class self-organization and, clsss independence, or consciousness. These countries were not following social revolution so much as seeing the post-revolution USSR as a model for national development outside of western capitalism. China was a fusion of a defeated worker\u2019s movement and nationalists, Cuba wasn\u2019t even a communist revolution - both Vietnam and Cuba tried to appeal to the US on the basis of being independence movements. Cuba became communist after the fact because the US tried to overthrow the regime and cut of ties and Cuba turned to the USSR for support.",

During the Revolution of 1848-9, not only the European princes, but the European bourgeois as well, found their only salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian intervention. The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction. Today, he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina [B], and Russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe.\nThe Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the proclamation of the inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property. But in Russia we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle and bourgeois property, just beginning to develop, more than half the land owned in common by the peasants. Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeval common ownership of land, pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West?\nThe only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development.\u201c\n\nburawoy.berkeley.edu/Marxism/Marxism%20As%20Science.pdf\n\u201cDevelopments in Russia appeared to re- fute the Marxian idea that revolution would first break out in the most advanced rather than the most backward capitalist countries. While Lux- emburg intuited the solution to this anomaly, it was Trotsky who, as early as 1906 in Results and Prospects ([1906], 1969), developed his theories of the combined and uneven development of capitalism and of permanent revolution to explain and anticipate the October Revolution and its aftermath. The prophetic power of Results and Prospects is supported by the fact that Trotsky\u2019s celebrated History of the Russian Revolution written in 1930 (1977) was based on the same theory. \n\nOrthodox Marxism, represented in Russia by the towering figure of Plekhanov, argued that Russia had to undergo a bourgeois revolution before it could advance to socialism. It was therefore at a loss to exploit the growing militan- cy and radicalism of the working class. By con- trast, Trotsky argued that the only class that could carry out a bourgeois revolution in Russia was the working class, and by virtue of that fact the bourgeois revolution had to proceed unintermpt- edly to a socialist revolutionwhich could only be successful if it also triggered a revolution in the West. This was Trotsky\u2019s theory of permanent revolution.\n\nBut why was the working class the only possi- ble agent of a bourgeois revolution? Capitalism in Russia developed very late under the spon- sorship of the state and of foreign (particularly French) investment. Being weak and dependent, the Russian bourgeoisie was continually plun- dered by a Czarist regime that was threatened militarily by states built on much more advanced (capitalist) economic foundations. At the same time that absolutism stifled the growth of the forces of production, the establishment of the most (technically) advanced capitalism in the major Russian cities created a new and militant working class. The majority of Russian workers had been recently uprooted from their land. It did not embrace the conservative traditions of Western proletariats which had evolved with capitalism. So, when brought together in huge factories the Russian working class displayed all the features of a revolutionary class. \n\nThe novelty of Trotsky\u2019s theory of combined and uneven development lay in its treatment of the international character of capitalist develop- ment and its political implications. According to Trotsky, capitalism did not develop unilinearly in parallel fashion within each country as Marx had assumed, but rather jumped from one coun- try to another. Uneven development led to the combination of the most advanced and the most backward forms of production, creating in coun- tries of the \u201csecond rank\u201d a weak bourgeoisie and an explosive working class. While the peas- antry was crucial in destabilizing absolutism, it could not lead a revolution. That role would have to be adopted by the working class, which would not be able to stop at the overthrow of absolut- ism. Precisely because it was a working class and its interests were therefore at odds with cap- italism, it would have to move forward to social- ism. By spreading back from East to West the revolution would be permanent in the interna- tional arena after it had been made permanent within Russia.\n\u2026\nThat he was wrong in his diagnosis of the situ- ation in the West does not detract from the fe- cundity of his theory of combined and uneven development of capitalism. Indeed, Lenin and Gramsci in different ways would develop that theory to explain the pacification of the Western working class just as others have used it to ex- plain the radical character of the working class in Third World industrializing countries today, such as Brazil and South Africa (Seidman 1990).\n\nEven Trotsky did not preclude the possibility of the defeat of the working class in the West. In Results and Prospects (1969) he wrote that fail- ing a revolution in the West the Russian revolu- tion would be aborted and would turn inward on itself. He anticipated the broad outlines of what actually happened after 1917. The tragedy of Trotsky\u2019s life was that he was destined to be the agent and the victim of his own accurate predic- tions -the involution of a Russian Revolution that was not followed by revolution in the West, the process he analyzed with great acuity in Revolution Betrayed ([I9361 1972).\u201d",

Marx never lived long enough to experience the era of global capitalism and imperialism, so in his time, when capitalism was mostly developed in parts of western Europe that too to only a limited extent outside England, he was certain that since capitalism has developed the most in these countries, this development would lead these countries towards communism earlier too.  \nBut what changed during imperialism, when the Russian revolution and all the further revolutions occurred? It was the fact that colonialism and imperialism causes certain countries to lag behind in development and thus global capitalist system creates conditions where revolutions can emerge in peripheral regions, as these areas experience exploitation and oppression that can catalyse revolutionary movements. Advanced developed countries on the other hand, have a labour aristocracy, which hinders its potential to actualise a revolution.",

He saw what was happening at the time, and thought those trends might continue.\n\nHe developed his ideas based on trends that existed at the time, but, imperialism really only fully developed after his death, and it enabled workers to fight for, and win, concessions from the bosses, lessening their own exploitation to something they could live with (while still being massively exploited), while the capitalists could still grow ever fatter by exploitation the colonies even more.\n\nMeanwhile, capitalism and industrialist grew massively in the colonial world. And while Russia wasn't a colony per se, it was an economic colony of the West, especially France. The biggest and most advanced production was being moved there. Lenin wrote a whole book about it, in 1893, 24 years before the revolution. \n\nFurthermore, Marx only ever analyzed young capitalism, when a country is transitioning from agrarianism to industrialiam. People were switching from a life dictated by nature, only working when the sun was up, not working all seasons, to a work schedule dictated by machines, working around the clock, all year long. This shift creates a lot of conflict and resentment ... until people get used to it.\n\nIn 1902, the Lena goldfield strikes, and the subsequent massacre, shocked European Marxists with their militancy. Before that, the Second International assumed Germany would be where the revolution breaks out, bylut after Lena, and especially after the 1905 Revolution, the 2I theorizes that the revolution will break out in Russia first, then spread to Germany, and from there, across the world.\n\nAnd Marc and theorized the possibility of this in his introduction to the Russian edition of the Manifesto, thinking that Russian forms of collective property might enable Russia to skip capitalism, have a revolution, which spreads to Europe.\n\nAnd that's what happened. Revolution spread to Germany, to Hungary, to Finland, to the Baltic, to Italy, to Turkey, to Mexico.\n\nBut then something happened that no one, not even Lenin thought possible. The revolution in Germany failed BUT the revolution in Russia wasn't defeated. This was because the world was so exhausted, between WWI and the pandemic, it simply didn't have the strength to complete the defeat of the revolution. \n\nAnd after that, we're in entirely new territory. Revolutionary Russia unites with Revolutionary Ukraine and Revolutionary Transcaucausia to form the USSR. The USSR industrialized, and IT serves the role that Germany was supposed to, for new revolutions in China, Cuba, and elsewhere.\n\nIt wasn't that Marx was wrong. He simply was too soon to see how capitalism would develop. It was incomplete, not mistaken. And he's always clear when he makes his \"predictions,\" that they are based on present conditions, and if those conditions changed, then his predictions go out the window.\n\nMarx was not a prophet.

However, historical events unfolded in a strikingly different manner.\n\nSurprisingly, it was the least developed nations, still entrenched in feudal social structures and predominantly populated by peasants, that experienced revolutions. The initial expectation was that revolutionary change would occur in countries already possessing the necessary infrastructure and industrial capacity to build upon, thereby creating an abundance of essential goods and services. Instead, these less advanced nations found themselves struggling to catch up with the most developed capitalist countries, often with unfavorable outcomes.\n\nThis historical divergence from Marx's predictions raises intriguing questions about the nature of social and economic change. It suggests that the conditions for revolution may be more complex than initially theorized, involving factors beyond mere economic development.\n\nThere's a compelling argument made by some contemporary critical theorists that extends beyond traditional Marxist thought. They posit that the most insidious aspect of our current economic system lies not in the ideas we consciously engage with, but in those that have seamlessly integrated themselves into our perception of common sense. This invisible ideological framework shapes our understanding of what is possible, practical, and even imaginable in terms of social and economic alternatives. By disguising itself as natural or inevitable, this pervasive mindset effectively limits our ability to envision and pursue fundamental systemic changes, subtly reinforcing the status quo even as we attempt to challenge it.",

China, Vietnam etc are more correctly characterised as a national bourgeoise revolution against the feudal vestiges and against the foreign imperialists, managed by the state, at most state capitalism.

Since Land can't be created by more labor (unlike other Capital like machines), agrarian landlords can and do enrich themselves by pushing peasants wages to the bare minimum of survival.  The revolution comes when peasants are pushed over the edge and have nothing left to lose by rebelling.

During his time the utopian socialist idealists thought the peasantry and progressive bourgeoise would work towards socialism. Marx argued against this and said only the proletariat could bring about socialism itself and that the petit bourgeoisie would have to be led by the proletariat to socialism. The proletariat itself is the only class that can emancipate itself through its own political actions. Not the bourgeoisie, the peasantry or a party dictatorship distinct from the masses of workers that tries to unite worker, peasant and capitalist. A dictatorship of the proletariat class over the other classes. It\u2019s what distinguishes Marx from the Jacobins, the Lassaleans, the Blanquists, Saint-Simon or Proudhon\u2019s anarchists.
