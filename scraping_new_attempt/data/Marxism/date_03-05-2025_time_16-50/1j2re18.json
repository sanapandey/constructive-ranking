Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

            "body": "The entire point is that the miser is not fulfilling the role of a capitalist -- the capitalist is the \"opposite\" -- the miser is hoarding and hiding his wealth, keeping it locked away from circulation, whereas the capitalist is constantly putting their wealth back into circulation, where it can grow into larger and larger sums.  There is nothing \"benevolent\" about either.\n\n>As the conscious representative of this movement, the possessor of money becomes a capitalist. His person, or rather his pocket, is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns. The expansion of value, which is the objective basis or main-spring of the circulation M\u2014C\u2014M, becomes his subjective aim, and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations, that he functions as a capitalist, that is, as capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will. Use-values must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist;  neither must the profit on any single transaction. The restless never-ending process of profit-making alone is what he aims at.  This boundless greed after riches, this passionate chase after exchange-value, is common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser. The never-ending augmentation of exchange-value, which the miser strives after, by seeking to save his money from circulation, is attained by the more acute capitalist, by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation.\n\n-Marx, Capital vol 1. ch 4",

                            "body": "I put opposite in quotes because your question is nonsensical.  You seem to be confused and describing some fantasy you've imagined for yourself in place of Marxism.  There is no such thing as a \"benevolent spendthrift\" and Marxism has nothing to do with \"character types\" (if you mean *class* that is distinctly different, and has nothing to do with the categories based on personality that you've invented).  Your understanding of capitalism and Marxism is wrong and you need to start over.  As the direct quote from Marx in Capital I linked states quite clearly:\n\n>>This boundless greed after riches, this passionate chase after exchange-value, is common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser.\n\nThe point is that the miser is someone with wealth who tries to hoard their wealth and maintain it by keeping it from circulation, not having it go to production and producing commodities and taking them to market and attempting to see it come back as a larger value than when it left through the realization of exchange -- the miser keeps their wealth out of circulation instead.  But this is madness to capitalism -- because the capitalist does the exact opposite.  He takes his wealth to circulation, enters the process of production to create commodities, sells them (we will ignore finance capitalism for the moment) and returns with more wealth than from when he began -- and so he does not hoard, he sends his money back into circulation to do the whole cycle over again and return with even more, over and over.  Thus, the capitalist fortune is constantly growing and expanding while the miser's is stagnant.  This is also why misers basically no longer exist today, while capitalists are everywhere (rich people's wealth isn't predominantly in a safe or a mattress, it is in stocks and investments and bonds and other forms of ownership being used to accrue and grow and compound wealth).",

The problem being that \"character types\" or \"archetypes\" is an incorrect idealist formulation (edit: not really any different than invoking the Zodiac, or assigning people 'auras') and your basically operating on some sort of Philomena Cunk and/or video game logic where the basis for existence begins at some imagined 'character creation screen,' or just the ideas in your head, rather than the existence of material reality and history, which then generates the conditions by which things, including people and their ideas about the world, emerge into being.",
