    "selftext": "I am just a beginner in marxist theory. But what I have got is good pattern recognition and an intuitive sense in history. And from what I see, this is the time that I have been both dreading and waiting for. Often, in my poems, I refer to a time where the masks are off, and where we see who is an ally and stands against oppression, and who is not. How do you more advanced in theory and organizing see this moment in history? Do you have some books that are or talk about these sorts of times where it seems that society is breaking apart, and that something has got to give in terms of the instability of the system, but it is open whether the change will be for better or for worse?",

Corporate powers are the ones in an arms race with each other for them, openly talking about how much engineers they will be able to cut after their projects become functional. \n\nOr do you consider the upper middle class as irrelevant to the worker's struggle?",
