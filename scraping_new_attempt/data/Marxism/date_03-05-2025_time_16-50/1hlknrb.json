    "selftext": "I'm looking at dialectics and trying to learn about them as much as possible (primarily from the perspective of Marxism, but Hegel and others are also welcome). Dialectical contradiction is not the same as logical contradiction, but are there any connections or opposites in how they behave? For example,\n\nIf we have a logical contradiction, are these opposing forces also dialectically contradicting each other? (I'd think not, since in dialectics, these two things have to exist in order to oppose each other),\n\nWhat about the other way around, if we have a dialectical contradiction, are the opposing forces logically contradictory? (I'd also say no for the same reason as above).\n\nCould one consider something like \"in dialectical contradiction to 'reality' \"? For logical contradiction if something contradicts tautology, it is then false. What can we conclude if something contradicts something unchangeable? (I'm not sure of the answer here, I'm reluctant to say that is false or nonexistent, since it is in contradiction with something, so due to my previous answer, it has to exist, but maybe it will cease existing soon?)\n\nAfter a contradiction is resolved, is this resolution permanent? (I've seen people say yes, but I don't see it. Especially from Marxist perspective. A society might resolve contradictions of feudalism and come to capitalism, but be utterly destroyed due to some circumstances, negating all their development, degrading back into feudalism. The \"bombed back to the stone age\" scenario might cause that, possibly.)\n\nAny other similarities and differences that one might think are notable?\n\nMy answers might be incorrect, feel free to go into details on how they are incorrect, if so or expand upon them if you think they are correct but missing some crucial observations.\n\nI'd love for references to these, and preferably from Marxist sources, since I'd love to refer to them. If those are unavailable, Hegelian and other sources are welcome, but I'd love to prioritize Marxist ones, since I'm doing it for a seminar or differences in Marxist and logical contradictions.",

            "body": "As far as I'm aware, it is logically impossible for something to be at once a dialectical contradiction AND a logical contradiction. As you mentioned, logical contradictions negate themselves; it essentially poses two things that cannot be true at the same time. For example, you cannot have a communist society in which the bourgeoisie rules; that would be a logical contradiction. Or a more simple one: \"John is alive and dead at the same time.\" In either case, the two statements cannot both be true. \n\nDialectical contradictions are entirely different. Here, the contradiction is an essential part of something's existence. For example, the bourgeoisie can only exist as a ruling class if there is another class over which it rules. This creates a contradiction between opposing forces (in this case the two classes), and this contradiction is a defining element of a certain thing (in this case bourgeois rule or capitalism). \n\nThe main difference, perhaps, is that logical analysis is a tool primarily used to analyse and critique argumentative structures and use of language, whereas dialectical analysis is a tool with which to analyse the world. They concern themselves with different 'objects of study', if you will. There is therefore no real relation between logical and dialectical contradictions. \n\nI am not really aware of texts going into both logical and dialectical contradictions. If you want to learn more about it I would suggest reading the important works on Hegelian/Marxist dialectics and those on logic.",

This can be seen as contradictions just in the mind but I think he would emphasize that contradictions are essential to reality itself because reality is \u2018t mere sameness and similarity as found with abstract universals, rather dynamics are based in lacking. \n\nFor example, the commodity form, the contradiction of use and exchange isn\u2019t merely a product of imagination or opinion but its from this basic contradiction arises all other more complex contradictions in the entire mode of production in capitalism.\n\nAnd Ilyenkov describes contradictions which aren\u2019t merely errors in ones thinking but of the actual object of study as being resolved by identifying some third thing which unifies them, shows that they aren\u2019t independent. It resolves the absolute dichotomy that has thinking choose one or the other and tried to redefine terms to ignore the problem.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/articles/school-learn.pdf\n- see page 23\n\nI take it that identifying such a third thing, something which resolves the appearance of an absolute contradiction by being mediated by these third fact is the identifying of w concrete universal. And there is no ready made way of identifying such a thing other than intense study and trial and error. Its the particular thing which explains other particulars.\n\nA problem with dialectical logic is that if it were to be formalized it would cease to be as such, but then how to teach it? Well immersing ones self in the analysis of those who think as such is fruitful. \n\nOther than Marx I like Lev Vygotsky\u2019s Thought and Language where he summaries to theoretical positions that language and thought as the same and another that treats speech and thought more independently but he shows that while they start separate, they converge in a child\u2019s development. By a concrete universal or basic unit of analysis, word meaning, he traces the independence and their unity in their development.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/chat/index.htm#unit\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/articles/universal.htm\n\nhttps://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/Epoque_Keynote_Address.pdf\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think a contradiction is exactly resolved entirely, or leads to no contradictions. That appearence of a contradiction may be resolved if it is a theoretical impasse in study of some object but quite often contradictions like that which Marx analyzed, starting with the commodity form doesn\u2019t erase contradictions by identifying the underpinning mediating factors of a thing, rather the contradiction of the commodity form develop into more complex kinds as it takes over other social formations and develops beyond mere act of exchange, but activity that reproduces and expands itself upon existing social formations.",
