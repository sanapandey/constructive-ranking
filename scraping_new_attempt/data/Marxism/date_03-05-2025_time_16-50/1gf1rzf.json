I came across this one and it's kind of amazing that all the examples of how \"Marx was wrong\" got reversed in the 1980s under Reagan. \"Workers aren't exploited because we have labor unions\", \"American peacefully transitions power\", \"Politicians come from the working class\" etc\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JNk9ZFqTt-Q?si=8toARlycCTqPEOKO",

            "body": "Marxism was never wrong, because it's only a critique of the objective capitalist workings using social structures to show how it leads to bad outcomes. The \"there's nothing wrong with unfettered capitalism\" crowd simply refuses to accept that there is even a society with classes in it. If you are pro union you are just anti capitalist to them. Anything to not have to talk about inequality in capital allocation. Even when they do force themselves to talk in those terms they dream up things like equality of opportunity (a la Obama) to assuage what remains of the left.",
