Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I would have to be keeping up with numerous equations being put forth in the most long-winded fashion possible. I now realize an Audiobook is not the optimal format for this but don't wanna buy Capital physically (expensive) and don't like reading off the phone. Can you guys recommend some reasonably thorough breakdowns of the main points and terminology of the text?",

You can find a short summary of marx surplus value theory in Marx text: Value, Price and Profit\n\n3. if you want a summary of someone else, there are very different interpretations of capital throughout time ans place and school of thought. state of the art interpretation in germany today is probably from Michael Heinrich [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An\\_Introduction\\_to\\_the\\_Three\\_Volumes\\_of\\_Karl\\_Marx%27s\\_Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Introduction_to_the_Three_Volumes_of_Karl_Marx%27s_Capital)",

Your estimation, would that provide a solid enough understanding of at least the core concepts explored in Capital? I understand I'll probably be missing out on a fair bit just given the difference in scale, but as long as it's enough to just get my bearings and form a solid foundation.",

You should get much more out of it as the core concepts.",

                            "body": "Heinrich's book is extremely heterodox as it rejects a labour theory of value, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF) and contributions made by Engels. Heinrich rejects Marxism (he favours a very narrow interpretation of Marx's economic writings without the revolutionary conclusions).\n\nIf you are not already familiar with the classical Marxist ideas of the labour theory of value and TRPF this is quite difficult to get your head around.\n\n[Understanding Marx's Capital](https://www.marxist.com/marx-capital-guide.htm) is what helped me understand Capital properly, readable with modern examples. As I think you've discovered Marx repeats himself heavily in Capital and stresses the wrong parts: I got 200 pages in without properly understanding the difference between use-value and (exchange-)value (and that's not the worst terminology he uses).",

            "body": "Capital is Marx setting up an \"ideal abstract\" model of how the capitalist system works and then testing that model using real-world data and using it to uncover inherent problems in the system that cause it to undermine itself given enough time. It is also him critiquing the foundations of economics as a science.\n\nMarx's basic method is to take a small part of capitalism and analyze it in the abstract, defining it and saying how it works. Then he adds in a second small part. This second part transforms the definition of the first in their relation to each other. This allows Marx's analysis to rise from \"abstract to concrete\" and start to resemble a sort of time-lapsed picture of capitalism, not describing any particular period, but capturing aspects of it as a whole. \n\nThe first 3 chapters are about setting up this model in the abstract. Marx starts from commodities and slowly adds in more and more variables and observations.\n\nI highly recommend this article by Diane Elson called *The Value Theory of Labour*. It really helps clarify a lot of things on Marx's ideas about value in these first 3 chapters and explains the common misinterpretations in activist and academic circles.\n\nhttp://digamo.free.fr/elson79-.pdf\n\nHeinrich's book that someone recommended is good, but I have some small quibbles and disagreements with his presentation. Simon Clarke's notes on Capital are also super good\n\nhttps://cominsitu.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/simon-clarkes-guide-to-capital.pdf",

However, you don't need to understand it to the fullest to understand the political aspects of marxism, You can read most texts of Marx and take your time with Capital.",
