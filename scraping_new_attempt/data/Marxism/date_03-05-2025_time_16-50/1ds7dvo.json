    "selftext": "How exactly does China utilize its foreign investments? Many members of the \u201cLeft\u201d have criticized the CPC for allowing foreign enterprises to operate in China, believing that the Party has somehow capitulated to the will of the Western oligarchs who run these companies. This article will provide insight into how China actually engages with foreign companies, uses their investments and foreign IP transfers for the purpose of moving up the industrial chain.\n\n[Read the full article here.](https://www.rtsg.media/p/how-china-beats-the-west-in-its-own)\n\nThis article is the fifth part of RTSG\u2019s series of articles exploring China and her economy, with previous articles covering [China\u2019s state-owned enterprises](https://rtsg.substack.com/p/state-ownership-and-the-peoples-republic), [China\u2019s financial system](https://rtsg.substack.com/p/a-peoples-cup-of-solid-gold) and [economic growth](https://rtsg.substack.com/p/chinas-quantum-leap-forward), and [China\u2019s corporate governance](https://rtsg.substack.com/p/corporate-governance-in-the-peoples).",

The Chinese citizens do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as the people in western democracies.",

Because they don't allow their capital to get stormed like you guys did here in Brazil?\n\n I mean, I'd rather not watch someone using their Western \"rights and privileges\" to attack a democratically elected government, destroy the capital of my country, and **literally** shit all over our democratic institutions, from the Supreme Court to Congress, just because of a candidate losing an election... \n\nBesides, are you even the best judge for \"democracy\" vs \"totalitarism\"?

Maybe not all aspects of their government but democracy, as seen in the US, is not exactly smtg people are begging for. In their perspective, democracies are unstable and inefficient. \n\nFrankly, to them, democracy is not an ideal. It is a tool, just like dictatorship, communism, capitalism and so on. Their priority is on the effects of these tools and whether they can benefit their lives. Democracy doesn't look that great in the US after all...\n\nAs for basic human rights, Chinese people are not deprived of their right to live and prosper. And that really is what people in China care about, living prosperous lives where they can move up in the social ladder, even at the cost of certain rights that foreigners might find essential such as the right to have a shitload of kids and the right of free access to uncensored media.",
