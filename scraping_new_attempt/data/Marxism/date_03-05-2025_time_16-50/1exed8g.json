The neo-Stalinist social chauvinists of the Russian Communist Workers\u2019 Party (RKRP) first echoed Lenin Crews\u2019 argument about not providing \u201cevidence\u201d for ties to Russia, but then continued with a cynical declaration of support for the Russian invasion:\n\n>... Well be consistent! Since your comrade was against the SMO \\[Special Military Operation\\] from the beginning, don\u2019t complain now! Alas, but it is quite logical that he got a full spoonful of it! Now he has a chance to find out on his own skin whose regime is more reactionary. Only the \u201creactionary\u201d troops of the dreadful, terrible Putin will free him. We are, to put it mildly, not fans of Vladimir Vladimirovich, but your comrade\u2019s position is frankly stupid. Do not mechanically copy the tactics of the Bolsheviks of the early twentieth century! Think with your head! The Bolsheviks tied their tactics to specific conditions, which are absolutely not equal to today\u2019s conditions.\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more obnoxious example for social chauvinist rhetoric. We only cite it so that workers and young people in Russia and other parts of the world who read it will remember how social chauvinists behave when socialist opponents of war are persecuted in a country that has been invaded by their own government. No doubt, many others, who chose to remain silent, share this position and fear that by speaking out publicly in favor of a Ukrainian anti-war socialist, their alliance with pro-Kremlin forces will be undermined. If organizations such as the Revolutionary Workers\u2019 Party (RPP), which decided to ignore our call, would publish a statement in support of Bogdan, or at least even spread information about him in their social networks, how will they then be able to continue to have their members also be members of the Stalinist Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which openly endorses the invasion, and participate in local and federal elections, etc?\n\nThe second response was from the Ural Maoist Union (SMU), until recently part of the well-known Russian Maoist Party (RMP), which also refused to defend Bogdan. The SMU\u2019s refusal to defend Bogdan Syrotiuk deserves to be quoted in full. They wrote,\u00a0\n\n>We consider it unacceptable to interfere in the affairs of the working class of another state. We also believe that any help to your comrade from Russia would be harmful. This story is a matter of Ukrainian politics. Its coverage and defense of your comrade should \\[be\\] handled by Ukrainian politicians and Ukrainian media. We consider it unacceptable to help the Ukrainian security services with evidence of your comrade\u2019s connection with Russians. We consider it even more unacceptable to create reasons for Russian propaganda to demonize Ukraine, to declare it a concentration of atrocities and evils. The very last thing one would want is to aid Russian imperialism, and it is important for Ukrainian communists to defend their independence. Your comrade\u2019s story is unpleasant, no doubt, but it should be an exposure of the anti-people character of the Ukrainian regime from and for Ukrainians.\n\nThis response makes a mockery of the basic Marxist principle of internationalism, inscribed since the days of the\u00a0*Communist Manifesto*\u00a0(1847): \u201cWorkers\u2019 of the World Unite.\u201d Instead, the Maoists juxtapose to internationalism the principle: Workers of the world, \u201cdo not interfere with the affairs of the working class of another state.\u201d To put it bluntly, this is an ultra-nationalist, anti-socialist position which exposes the Maoists as an organization that has nothing to do with the defense of the interests of the working class.\u00a0\u00a0  \n...",

The fraudulent case against Bogdan is an outrageous example of the criminal persecution of leftist and anti-war activists by the capitalist authoritarian regime in Kiev.  \n  \nShortly after the news about Bogdan spread around the world, a number of Russian leftist organizations and media outlets covered his case and expressed their support for Bogdan, demanding his immediate release, thus expanding the international campaign.  \n  \n- #1 -  Rabkor website, which is run by the now imprisoned Boris Kagarlitsky in Russia.  \n\n> \u201cWhile we do not share the views of the World Socialist Web Site, we express solidarity with the activist group \\[YGBL\\].

This situation should again open the eyes of some leftists as to the essence of the Ukrainian regime. Unfortunately, some of them see in it precisely a genuine bourgeois democracy of the Western European model and believe that their anti-communism ends with the struggle against Stalinism. This is fundamentally wrong. Ukraine is already an ultra-right-wing dictatorship that has abruptly and irrevocably decided to do away with any manifestations of Marxism in the country. And even though we disagree with a large number of communists in Ukraine in many aspects, we express our solidarity with them in their hard struggle. Down with Zelensky\u2019s junta!

Human rights activists of the Foundation to Combat Repression strongly condemn the wrongful arrest of Bogdan Syrotiuk. According to the unanimous opinion of the Foundation\u2019s experts, Bogdan\u2019s case has all the signs of a politically motivated persecution.
