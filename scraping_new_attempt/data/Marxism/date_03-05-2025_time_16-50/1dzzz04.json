    "selftext": "Hi comrades! \n\nI\u2019m preparing a class on revolutions in the global south and how they\u2019re different than revolutions in the global north.\n\nI\u2019ve been working a lot with the idea of Marxist idea of Aufheben in economics, i.e the superseding of one economic system for another.\n\nMy thesis for this class will be that revolutions in the global south have vastly different material conditions than revolutions in the global north and therefore need to first have a \u2018bourgeois\u2019 revolution, freeing themselves from colonialism and superseding colonial economics with state capitalist economics. \n\nIn my opinion, this superseding of colonial economics by capitalist economics is necessary for revolutions in the global south to create an large and empowered proletariat that can lead the superseding of capitalism by socialism, and an industrial base which will aid in civilian and military industry to catch up with the bourgeoisie in the global north who have an advantage because of centuries of colonialism.\n\nSo if any of you have recommendations of books or other media related to revolution/revolutionaries in the global south, or just marxist theory from revolutionaries in the global south.",

I think you\u2019ll have a hard time coming to any definite conclusions without reading very widely. If you\u2019re teaching on this in the fall and don\u2019t know where to start, I strongly suggest you consider an alternative angle for now. \n\nGood luck in either case though!",

My goal with this presentation is to rid the non-communist wing pf the organisation of bourgeois propaganda about the global south and it\u2019s revolution, also demystifying what a revolution actually means and show the more uneducated and reformist members that revolution is not something \u201cbarbaric\u201d and violent, rather a well planned organisation of the proletariat that will lead to it\u2019s dictatorship.",
