Are those introductory bits all worth the read or should I skip straight to book one? Apologies if this is a silly question.",

All that and the much improved translation make it well worth picking up the hard copy, it\u2019s the best quality production of any of the various publishers\u2019 versions I\u2019ve had, although that is likely also due to being the first hardcover I\u2019ve bought.",

The economical theory is straightforward. Most people have trouble understanding, why the labour theory of value is so crucial and why one should deal with these issues. If you have this, understanding circulation, money, capital etc. is only technique and straightforwardly explained.",

            "body": "I strongly recommend reading Mandel's Introduction, especially if you're not familiar with Capital. If I remember correctly, it's not too long, around 80 pages, and Mandel does a great job of taking you through the ideas and processes detailed by Marx. It's an excellent summary. By the time you reach the first chapter, everything will appear familiar to you and you'll be able to follow Marx quite easily.\u00a0\n\n\nI haven't read Wendy Brown's myself, nor the new translation, but I'm sure it's good. However, if you already have the Penguin or Pelican edition, it will do just fine. Definitely read the Introduction by Mandel.\n\n\nAs for the Prefaces, I don't actually remember anything too significant in them. I might be missing something, but I'm fairly confident you can skip them.\u00a0",

They\u2019re not very \u201ctheory heavy\u201d I suppose, but they give a good introduction to the text from the author, and while they\u2019re not strictly necessary to understanding the meat of Marx\u2019s work, still, I think they\u2019re valuable.",
