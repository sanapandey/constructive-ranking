In that time, there have only been 7 elections closer than the most recent one. She received the third most votes for any candidate, ever. So she did not lose as badly as the right would have you believe (not that you believe that, necessarily).\n\nI also want to point out that I am not defending Harris's policies or morality or any of her decision making in the campaign or as a politician.\n\nDo you have a link to stats or something that it was people not voting as a Gaza protest that led to her defeat in swing states?\n\n> How do you figure? Non-voters didn't vote for her bc they wanted to punish her for committing genocide and force the Democratic Party into agreeing to a ceasefire before Trump took office. It seems like they were successful at both.\n\nI guess I figured they wanted to help Gazans. I'm not really sure how they \"forced\" the Democratic Party to \"agree to a ceasefire\", because a) the Democrats were not the ones holding out, b) the Biden admin's efforts towards a ceasefire, even just the current one, started more than six months ago, and c) Trump already made it clear that he wanted a ceasefire. In fact, he wanted it prior to the 20th. So either: the ruling party couldn't motivate a ceasefire, in which case it didn't matter who won, or they could, in which case both the republicans and democrats were working on doing so.\n\nWhen the choice is between someone who is evil and someone who is comic book level evil I would pick the former. \"Punishing\" a candidate is childish to the point it feels like a psy-op on the part of the Republicans. It's not in a vacuum. If punishing the Democrat means electing a Republican, who is not only far worse for Gazans but everybody on earth, it's simply impossible to make that argument.\n\nI'll accept people who say that they felt, morally, that they could not vote for someone who was not vocally against the genocide (as I said, Harris did call for a ceasefire). But I do not accept that it has or will lead to better outcomes for anyone involved, or that it was a calculated maneuver on the part of Marxists or anyone else.\n\n\"They succeeded\" in the sense it was always going to happen. The Democrats do not and did not suddenly care about what the far-left had to say.\n\n>  Considering both candidates were blatant liars I'm not sure if what they said had much impact. \n\nThis is just to deflect from the fact non-voters explicitly helped elect an outright authoritarian to the presidency. They might both be liars but in such varying degrees as to be a worthless comparison.\n\n> In my anecdotal experience this was not the case. I have no data to support this so grain of salt. There are lot of non-Marxists in the movement bc the number of Marxists in America is relatively small, but there were a many different Marxist orgs represented in (and even organizing) the protests and demonstrations.\n\nAll of this could be true and none of it contradicts the part you're quoting.",

Even if you\u2019re not under the constraints of a patented crop, it\u2019s still often preferable to buy new seed instead of seed saving to ensure genetic diversity and disease control, plus many plants don\u2019t go to seed until the second year so it\u2019s just not feasible to save seed unless that\u2019s the main objective of your setup.\n\nAll that to say, there\u2019s an ignorance pervading this whole document which makes it clear this is a petty bourgeois initiative from someone who\u2019s dissatisfied they can\u2019t live the way they did before 2020.

I do however have my issues with this, yes it\u2019s good to see some effort at collective action but the actions they are taking unfortunately will not be effective. Boycotts can and do get results however they need much more popular support. For example in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century entire villages and towns would refuse to supply even basic necessities to police, army or British government officials when they stayed there and anyone who did was ostracised. This is the level of solidarity that is needed in order to gain any collective bargaining power from it. At the minute it feels like this lacks any kind of class consciousness and fails to take in to consideration the power that fascists currently hold. Voting with your dollars is unfortunately not a viable strategy when going up against a flourishing totalitarian regime. However, this combined with a general strike, militant boycotts and civil disobedience may be enough to actually start to hurt their pockets.

The idealism here and trying to convince people that reality is something it\u2019s not. I think it\u2019s preferable for people to align with nationalism and capital because they actually understand the truth of things, than to be deceived into a movement that targets the state and capitalism. Although this movement is toothless, people know when they\u2019re being lied to and that will kill any positive engagement quickly and make your initiative look dishonest.",

Can I employ tactics that advance our cause at an event like this without compromising my principles? Would this be a good opportunity to hand out zines or flyers? \n\nThe organizers of this event are not going to be able to maintain the narrative they desire. They can have all the hopes in the world that this turns into a lib version of \"Reawaken America Patriotism.\" But if enough people there, many of whom may already be primed and ready to hear a socialist message, can be reached then maybe it's a net positive for us.\n\nRegardless, much like Lenin wished for the defeat of Russia in the first world war, we should be opportunistic of any unrest here in the States.

I think my discomfort is that I know a lot of people in the US are the opposite of primed to learn about socialism and are only in the position of questioning individualism and capitalism because they are seeing their basic needs go unmet suddenly. Any association with communism is received as a red flag and any history of communist organizing or a communist identity here has been revised and absorbed by liberalism. So I\u2019m wondering how people who have been drawn to participate in something like this through nationalism/ populism can actually be redirected into class consciousness that goes beyond, \u2018you don\u2019t have this thing you need, wouldn\u2019t you like to have it?\u2019",

And while there are calls to action, there are no actual plans or resources to do a lot of the things it claims the reader should do. It also doesn't reassure the reader really at all and back to the lacking of plans, there are no alternatives for what it is asking. Boycotts are a tool  the left should definitely use, when done right it proves to the proletariat that collective action works, but you can't just boycott everything. It has to be focused on else it's not realistic, and that is the last problem you are probably having with this. It is not realistic whatsoever. I personally think most of these things could work, and I don't think it would take very much ground work, but all of them at once, it is setting the reader up for failure, and maybe that is the point of the document.",
