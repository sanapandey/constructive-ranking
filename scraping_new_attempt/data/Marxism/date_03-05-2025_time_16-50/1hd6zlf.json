            "body": "So much gets confused in reading Marx without recognizing the specific conjuncture in which he wrote. Some of the misreading also arises from the capitalist subterfuge that dominates our thought. This subterfuge pushes the bizarre notion that capitalism is always peaceful and innocent and socialism/communism/Marxism is inherently violent and guilty.  That capitalist subterfuge is then complemented by a sort of infantile and desolate punk attitude that violence and nihilism is the best we can achieve.\n\n> What was Marx\u2019s perception of American democracy? \n\nThroughout his academic life, Marx used the US as his example of what Europe could be. The Decembrist Revolution in Russia was no doubt inspired by the American Revolution. The French Revolution was likewise inspired by the American Revolution, with American Revolutionaries, in residence, no doubt fomenting revolution whether they wanted to or not (Paine, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, and others in residence leading up to the French Revolution).\n\n> It turns out Marx actually had a quite favorable view of the American state, viewing it as seizable by workers via electoral means. This position is especially interesting in contrast it\u2019s his usual view of the bourgeois state, seeing its destruction as necessary for proletarian dictatorship.\n\nMarx favors the US democratic republic. The capitalist State is what he wanted smashed. The capitalist State only existed through the systematic subversion of the democratic republic by the capitalist ruling class. The socialist/communist Commonwealth kernel resides, smothering, under layers of capitalist excrement. Marx called for the expropriation of the expropriators. The expropriators are the capitalist ruling class. What have they expropriated? They expropriated the material means for our reproduction from our Commonwealth republic (making themselves the eminent domain allodial noble title holders of the means of production). \n\nLike so many Europeans (Kant, Bentham, Hegel, Godwin, Wolstencraft, Owen, Saint-Simon, Cabet), Marx was profoundly influenced by the new republic in America. The actual \u201cshot heard \u2018round the World\u201dwas a bourgeois ideological shot of revolutionary republicanism, liberty, equality, solidarity, and justice for all.  It was that bourgeois revolution that Marx believed was an indispensable revolutionary moment that made communism/socialism possible: both as the flint that ignited the socialist/communist idea and the material history that originated the socialist/communist movement. \n\nMarx longed for a similar bourgeois revolution to occur in Germany, that could equal or exceed the achievements of the American Revolution. His expressed frustrations in his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_, and many other of his writings, were directed at the dismal failures of the German bourgeoisie to shake off the feudal vestiges (so that the proletariat could then fulfill their historic role).\n\n> According to this video the factors which lead him to this are now irrelevant. \n>\n> \u22ee \n> \n> I was wondering if this is true, or if the American state could still become socialist peacefully via elections? \n\nThis video stumbles into the false dichotomies propagated by the capitalist subterfuge. \n\nIn the _Critique of the Gotha Programme_, Marx is chastising the Lassalleans, who dominated the drafting of the _Gotha Programme_. They called for all sorts of State policies from an imperial Prussian State completely unlike the governments in the UK, the US, and Switzerland. Yet this _Gotha Programme_ merely pretended the successful bourgeois revolution had already gripped Germany (rather than cosplay as a bourgeois revolution, much as the Russian Czar had cosplayed for a generation after the failed Decembrist Revolution as a liberal before turning draconian and despotic again. In his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_, Marx writes:\n\n> [The Programme\u2019s] political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular rights, a people\u2019s militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois People\u2019s party, of the League of Peace and Freedom. They are all demands which, insofar as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation, have already been realized. Only the state to which they belong does not lie within the borders of the German Empire, but in Switzerland, the United States, etc. This sort of \u201cstate of the future\u201d is a present-day state, although existing outside the \u201cframework\u201d of the German Empire.\n\nNow the question the video raises is whether the US has degraded into an imperial kaiser-run despotism,  cosplaying as a duly limited federalist constitutional republic? That is an important question, but it cannot be answered by mere speculation. It requires material engagement and praxis. Answering the question by obsequiously serving capitalist ruling class dogma and subterfuge is clearly a losing strategy. \n\nWhat socialism/communism/Marxism needs to do is to proceed with political strategies that test the question posed. That means making socialist/communist/Marxist policy debate, discussion, and propaganda/advocacy central to the class struggle. The policy vacuum works together with calls for revolutionary war to alienate the working class from their own communist interests and actively serves the capitalist ruling class by ensuring the working class never becomes a class for itself.  \n\nThe approach in the video thus dutifully serves the ruling class and undermines the working class.  Instead the policy discussions should facilitate campaigns and candidates deeply rooted within the working class, who pursue electoral victories with working class movements as the wind behind their sails. If that path is truly blocked, the political, polity, and policy focus will galvanize the working class movement and prepare it for the necessary violent proportionate defense against the capitalist ruling class aggression against the working class. Hitting such an electoral roadblock will  prove the mere cosplay as a constitutionally limited federalist republic and demonstrate the indispensable necessity that restoring constitutionality cannot occur within the bounds of a constitution that is then obviously no longer prevailing. The  testing for cosplay will constitute the working class becoming a class for itself. Once the working class becomes a class for itself, the capitalistic ruling class will never find enough weapon, enough avaricious mercenaries, nor even just the spine with which to defeat the juggernaut of a working class once it becomes a class for itself.",

The contradictions are increasing violently and the only way to counter this is with more violence. Imo",

The stench of deep rot seeping out of both parties is only getting more and more suffocating, which presents opportunities we have to be ready for, but we must not join the choir of apathy and hopelessness. \n\nHopelessness is a deadly sentiment we have to combat. As long as there is a working class, revolution is on the horizon. We have to fan the burning desire for justice and genuine democratic spirit that runs deep within our class, especially when democracy as a principle is rejected by right wing opportunists, but just as much when it is dismissed as futile by cynical radicals.\n\nChoosing to be absent from what most workers (those without class consciousness are no less democratically minded) recognize as the only practicable exercise in mass politics, is choosing estrangement at the worst possible moment. The same goes for choosing to bemoan their participation or condescend over it. \n\nWe need to familiarize and build a level of trust, or at least recognition, for Marxist principles among our class, so that it\u2019s obvious where to look when the heap of failing bourgeois democracy has become unbearable. Especially because by the time that happens on a mass scale, we need mass organizational structures\u2014 or at least enough acquaintances to reinforce them\u2014 in place to welcome them in to their political home.",

If he wrote about the USA in any other context I'm afraid I don't know what his opinions are. Perhaps others could chime in.\n\nBut Marx considered the US civil war a bourgeois revolution in the classic sense, and so in that regard it was *historically* progressive. Not to mention the US civil war involved the largest case of mass expropriation of property in history up until that point. What started as a war over secession turned into a revolutionary war of emancipation (of the slaves) and expropriation (of the slave owners). It was a war of the progressive bourgeoisie (industrial north) against the southern aristocracy (slave-based agricultural economy). It was actually the last proper bourgeois revolution of the 19th century. After that the era of the \"progressive\" bourgeoisie was over as world capitalism slowly turned into its imperialist stage, as analysed by Lenin at the turn of the next century. \n\nFor that Marx was absolutely right to have a favourable view of American democracy *at the time*. And marxists correctly consider the US civil war as the second American revolution.\n\nMarx even wrote a letter to Lincoln on behalf of the International Workingmen's Association, congratulating him on his re-election. I believe that letter is available online. \n\nBut times have changed, capitalism is in deep crisis, US imperialism is in (relative) decline, and now the conditions are rotten ripe for America's third revolution: the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of a workers' state. And no, that absolutely will not and cannot happen via the ballot box.\n\nEdit: Marx's letter to Lincoln written in November 1864 https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1864/lincoln-letter.htm it's a fascinating read.",
