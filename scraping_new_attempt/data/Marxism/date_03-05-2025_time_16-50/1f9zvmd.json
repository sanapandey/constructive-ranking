Would you say that they made the correct or incorrect decision in going about these policies?\n\nHonestly just asking. Thanks Comrades.",

But, what the Soviets did have to do is not only modernize their state but combat the forces of reaction. The Orthodox Church as an institution was both anti-modern and a bastion of reaction, as well as the Muslim institutions of the eastern republics. \n\nThe Soviet Union first and foremost endeavored during the 20s-40s develop a line based on the needs of the people and enabling them. Things like the veil burnings, and the seizing of church property, and the killing of priests were things that were part of the goals of the peasantry and the proletariat. The Religious institutions were incredibly predatory and corrupt. They were exploiters in labor and body of the peasantry.",

Stalin made few very bad decisions re church and religion policies. In 1937 com party members were harshly reprimanded for any religion, thousands of priests were brutally executed. Later, times of WW2, Stalin reversed his policies re- religion and church.",

The early crackdown against religious groups was wrong in all the wrong ways, and only showed that religion had no place in the USSR, especially with the League of Militant Atheists. The state atheist separation between religion and politics was noble, but nullified by the persecution of religious people.",
