    "selftext": "I think every new Marxist goes through a phase where Marxism sort of becomes their personality, and it's all they talk about and think about. I've seen people discuss that phenomenon at length.\n\nI'm now a few years into being a Marxist and while I've since become accustomed to not letting it dominate my identity, what I have seen discussed less often is that once that initial obsession wears off, there's a pervasive sense of social isolation that doesn't wear off. Not isolated in a literal sense, as I have many friends, am sociable, relate well to my peers, etc. But there is always a sense that everyone else is \"living in the matrix\" so to speak, and worse yet, you know you as an individual can't really do anything to shake people out of it. That's more the purview of organizations. And if you try as an individual, you'll often come off as crazy if you go too deep into things too soon, and have to talk to people like children, beginning with the least controversial positions that we take as Marxists. \"Hiding your power level,\" as many reactionaries like to put it.\n\nSo, I can speak to people and be as sociable as I ever was before becoming a Marxist, but in the back of my mind there is always a looming sense that I am vastly disconnected from the way everyone else in my immediate surroundings sees the world. At best it's socially isolating, at worst it can even lead to feelings of superiority, misanthropy, and contempt. Rationally, I know better than to feel those latter feelings, but sometimes when I'm just frustrated with the state of the world it's hard not to feel that as capital grows ever more moribund that people in the imperial core will ultimately get what they deserve one way or another.\n\nI'm not necessarily asking people here how to deal with those feelings, just thought people might find value in contributing to this discussion, whether to share advice for dealing with feelings or just commiserating in general.",

            "body": "Yeah, as someone who has been a Marxist for a decade, that feeling doesn't really ever go away. I don't feel any feelings of superiority or contempt because I have come to accept that 95% of the time, it is an education issue. I have continued to read a lot - history, philosophy, normal fiction. It really just expands your mind and it becomes obvious why the best art always bends in a progressive, leftist direction in a way that anything propping up the Imperial Core never will. \n\nI have become very accustomed to changing my rhetoric in a way that genuinely most people agree with (in the same way that fascists disguise their rhetoric to hide their true beliefs, except most of the time people don't actually want what the fascists are selling). At some point, you have to accept it's a matter of strategy IMO. The powerful thing about being a Marxist is that things rarely feel like \"they came out of nowhere\" in a way that liberals/conservatives always feel like they are reacting to events as they come. One example is obviously Israel-Palestine. And another comfort is seeing how much younger people are far more to the left than generations that precede it. There will always be reactionaries, but I take comfort in the fact that most people IMO agree with leftist ideology, you're just combatting the propaganda of the Imperial Core. I mean, Star Wars is literally one of the most popular pieces of media and it is quite literally a metaphor for the United States (The Empire) and Vietnam (The Rebels). People just don't see it unless they are educated on the matter.",

Many people simply have no interest in history, philosophy, or just generally trying to understand the world. I know that a lot of that is manufactured by our culture that wants people to think less and consume more, but it's still hard not to think less of people who seem to genuinely just not care. Gives me \"bread and circus\" vibes, that as long as people are fed and entertained they don't really care about whatever injustices our system may perpetrate. That sometimes it's less an issue of ignorance and more of selfishness. And to your point, I think that's reflected in a lot of our pop culture that is increasingly vapid, commercialized, and devoid of any real artistic merit.",

                            "body": "From what I see, the apathy tends to extend from the fact that most people genuinely do not understand what is happening in the world and it is too chaotic for them to decipher, and we live under a government that doesn't have an interest in bettering their material conditions so they disconnect and consume more to numb the pain as you say.\n\nPersonally, I don't think that people need to have an interest in history or philosophy. Not everyone is born to be an armchair philosopher or intellectual. I come from a really working class family where most are blue collar, work in construction, and really dropped out of high school. I am odd because I went to college and even got a master's degree. I can't hold construction tools to save my life. I have no applicable skills besides being knowledgeable, patient, and intellectual curiousity. \n\nTrust, in my experience, is the greatest indication of whether or not someone will respond to your ideas or remain apathetic. I personally hold the view that passion precedes reason. Most people have instinctual beliefs and they use logic/reason to justify it, not the other way around. Therefore, when you have a connection with someone who trusts you, they are more likely to process your logic and reason and incorporate it into their emotional psyche. Obviously, that is not always the case and sometimes they trust others more than you (I am sure those who come from families with military members will have a really hard time convincing them why US foreign policy is....not good, to put it mildly - unless they have experienced horrors first-hand).\n\nTL;DR Lots of apathy stems from a feeling of having no control. Not everyone is built to be an intellectual but it doesn't mean they're not open to having ideas that will help their lives. Vapid, endless entertainment is a plague but I have no idea how you resolve that one.",

Since the vast majority of people are bought-in to the capitalist, trad narrative in one facet or another, it becomes very difficult to look past. Especially if you\u2019re forced to be around it.\n\nI know there is a tendency among some leftists to look at liberals with disdain and write them off, but honestly this is neither helpful for advancing anti-capitalism sentiment nor for one\u2019s own mental health. \n\nPeople are, well, people. They are largely influenced by the system they are brought up in, the content they consume, and the education they receive. Focusing on that fact has helped me deal with things better.\n\nI fully agree with how you go about describing things to people who are unaware. Funnily enough, whenever I talk about corporate greed pretty much everyone (even conservatives) gets on board with what I\u2019m saying. I think having those conversations without using words that people have been conditioned to feel some type of way about (like Marxism or communism) would be fulfilling. Even if people don\u2019t fully agree, you\u2019re planting seeds.\n\nThat aside, I think the feeling of isolation will always be there. Such is the way of capitalism, after all. Connecting with others who are aware of it is definitely helpful.",

I worry that my car will be vandalized or I will be subjected to road rage if I put a socialist sticker on my car.  I'm worried a cop will act aggressive or punitive toward me if I'm wearing a political hoodie or hat when he pulls me over.  I'm worried about being targeted by the far right militia types that are so common here in rural Ohio.\n\nTo be honest though liberals are sometimes worse than conservatives.  Most of the time when I tell a conservative that I'm a Marxist or a communist, they honestly think it's kind of interesting, and they'll ask me weird questions like if I like Vladimir Putin or if I want to move to China.\nLibs though?  It sucks.  I had a lot of liberal friends who abandoned me when they found out that I didn't vote for Joe biden.

It\u2019s a tough transition when the intense passion begins to settle into a more stable understanding, yet you\u2019re left with that persistent sense of disconnection from pretty much everyone around you.\n\nYour reflections remind me of a quote from Terence McKenna: \u2018The reason we feel alienated is because the society is infantile, trivial, and stupid. So the cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation.\u2019 I think this really captures the dilemma we face as we navigate in a world that often seems indifferent or even hostile to critical thought.\n\nAnd your concerns about feeling superior or misanthropic are valid, especially in such a polarized environment. It\u2019s a natural reaction to be frustrated when it feels like the majority of people are unaware or unwilling to confront the realities we see.\n\nPerhaps by making this post and engaging  with others who share similar struggles can help foster a sense of belonging and connection, even if the broader society remains disconnected from the conversations we value.

My best advice for when you feel these thoughts and feelings is to often take a break from things in general, sometimes step outside, put on some music in headphones, go to the cinema, talk to family and friends even take a nap.

I had no control over whether or not I would be the type of person to become a Marxist, no control over whether or not I would have access to information to become a Marxist, etc.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd even if they have been exposed to the same information, whether or not a person's mind is receptive to the information- or even in a position to be receptive to it, is really out of their control.\n\n\nThat being said I have no solution for the loneliness. I've been lucky to meet a few people who think in a similar way, but I live in Texas and those people are few and far between.\u00a0",

Well, marxism is even more than that, it is that plus some academic rigor and a certain way of looking at the world. You rapidly discover that you are pretty much isolated. The stupidity of the liberal/bourgeois capitalist society demands a certain degree of alienation from people so that they can function within it. It is really hard to live your life otherwise. Not everyone has the moral resources to be aware that she/he lives in a profoundly unjust society and that it can only get worse with time. So most of the time the marxists feel like a religious sect, that is the sad truth. In my experience you can talk to normal people on these matters only if they do not have any idea about marxism and you don't bring up that specific terminology to the table.\n\nBut still, it is not a matter of people avoiding marxism, it is that they avoid any kind of critical inquire into social/cultural/political stuff - the system invests many resources trying to make people 'apolitical' and politics a dirty word. In my country, the main ultra-neoliberal/pro-capitalist party tries to convey its message into 'progressive' stereotypes for the young and even pretend they are 'apolitical', LOL. It is an old trick from the 19-th century liberal playbook getting people 'depoliticized' and trying to lecture them on economics and virtually every social problem as the result of same kind of inevitable 'natural laws' or 'human nature'. There is no greater and efficient apathy builder at the society level than this kind of discourse. People feel 'educated' just by parroting bourgeois propaganda. They feel smart when they discover that there are 'scientific' reasons for the world being as it is today. Too many people have been 'educated' to know their place, to identity with the system, to defend it. The more the material conditions of the current capitalistic society deteriorates, the more resources are involved in making people internalize that there is no alternative, that the current world is 'given' as it is, that even trying to make anything will end in gulags and horrors. We should try abandon very specific terminology when discussing with people on punctual social/economic problems. Or you can mention some of them as a kind of irony, it really helps.",

Live your best life, yet encourage others to organize and radicalize. Marx didn\u2019t encourage the proletariat to wallow in misery and victimhood, he just urged them to organize and rebel.\n\nA Marxist deeply cares about the welfare of others. I can relate a lot to the frustrations of blue-collar workers nowadays, even though they\u2019re being manipulated by bourgeois media to go against their own best interests. An effective agitator can express empathy towards the dude wearing a MAGA hat and connect with their working-class values. The MAGA\u2019s racism/transphobia/etc. is a product of capitalist alienation, lack of access to proper education, etc. \n\nThe pipefitter or factory worker showing up at a Trump rally is the one getting the most fucked over by the bourgeoisie. We as Marxists support this core of workers as the backbone of society. Liberals make the mistake of being condescending and snide, which radicalizes workers in the other direction towards fascism. Liberals perpetuate a cultural war of moral superiority using oppressed individuals as their pawns. They don\u2019t realize you can\u2019t solve the problems of racism/etc., without addressing the root of the problem, which is capitalism itself. You can\u2019t cure a wart by cutting off the top, you need to attack the root deep beneath the skin.",

If you've ever seen the movie *They Live*, being a Marxist is like when John Nada puts on the glasses and the colorful skies and advertisements turn to grayscale with bold words like *obey, reproduce, buy, consume, work, stay asleep, conform, watch television.*  Well, in the fictional world of the movie, Nada can take off the glasses whenever he wants.  In this existence we call reality, Marxists can't take the glasses off, no matter how hard we try.  We just learn to live with the fact that we see things for what they are, because we can't *unsee* the things we've seen.\n\nNever felt superior to anyone else, except maybe when getting into the back and forth with bully reactionaries who like to guilt, shame, victimize, and gaslight after I call them out for their illicit behavior.  Misanthopy?  Reserved only for sociopaths, psychopaths, and fascists.  Contempt?  Yes, knowing we as a society can do better, have the capacity to do better, yet make the active choice not to out of fear of offending the foolish and indignant.\n\nI remember the words of a dear friend, long ago who said, \"It is not your responsibility to correct the innumerable wrongs of the world.\"  The world is the way it is and life is too complex for an individual to do everything, let alone to be treated like a zero sum game as our society and country do so well.  So what can do you do?  Help the needy when they cross your path, volunteer some of your time when you can, educate, seek justice and speak the truth no matter how well they may hide themselves from you, and most important of all is to take care of and make time for yourself.\n\nThere's no need to hide your power.  Your power is not *their* power because *your* power lies in praxis -- in living, demonstrating, and exemplifying your beliefs *without letting them consume you*.  It's a lot like learning martial arts and how to fight.  You learn how to do these things, because if and when the day comes, you won't need to.  It's like the line from that song in the middle of *Office Space --* \"Real gangsters don't flex nuts, 'cause real gangsters know they got em'.\"\n\n  \nThis is how I reconcile with being a Marxist, and I'm much happier these days for it.",

As cadre, you should never 'speak down' to anyone but rather speak to them as equals; the l-proles aren't 'dumb civilians', they simply lack knowledge you possess and it's your responsibility to impart that knowledge to them so they may better understand the reasons(s) we call for change and the role(s) they can play in that change. \n\nFor Party cadre- or even a lone Marxist- to believe their political position makes them superior to another is a mistake, and one that should be recognized and dealt with as soon as possible. Criticism and self-criticism is a powerful tool we have at our disposal to maintain both our personal and Party lines. \n\nIt is natural to feel a state of futility, or even abject helplessness, to effect change in the beginning stages of revolution, especially in the face of tremendous social and/or political opposition. We, as the vanguard of revolution, must above all believe our cause is just, our methods are sound, and that victory is inevitable.",

If just anyone else would care more! In any case, maybe there's a chance for marxists to date a radical environmentalist, as they both share the same contempt against makeup-wearing, just for different reasons.\n\nI am sure there are other communities out there who feel the same about nobody acknowledging their ingenuity.
