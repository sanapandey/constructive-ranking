    "selftext": "Hello folks! I've identified as a Marxist since I was 16 (going on 10 years now, sheesh!) but my understanding is what I would describe as beginner. I've read the communist manifesto, and a lot of my beliefs came about through reading the biography of Che Guevara by Jon Lee Anderson as a teen. \n\n\nI was hoping you fine folks might be able to suggest some sources, books / lectures, whatever it may be, to really cement myself in Marxist philosophy. Naturally Das Kapital is already on my radar! \n\nGreatly appreciate any help, and look forward to any suggestions! \n\nEdit: Many replies so wanted to respond in one simple message. Thank you so much to all for the great suggestions, I'll be following many of these through my journey and can't understate how grateful I am for all the great resources you have all provided. Thank you much! ",

            "body": "For reading:\n\nI\u2019d recommend getting yourself a copy of The Marx-Engels Reader (edited by Tucker). It\u2019s got full or abridged versions of massive chunks of Marx and Engels\u2019 writing. There is a very manageable chunk of Capital vol. 1 plus excerpts from the later volumes.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for reading all of Capital vol. 1, it\u2019s definitely the thing to do. But really understanding core concepts in Capital is better than surveying everything he wrote about economics. I\u2019ve taught and reread the excerpts in the Tucker, and I always learn more each time.\n\nThe other thing I\u2019d recommend you get is McLellan\u2019s Marxism: Essential Writings. It has texts from a lot of major Marxists and historical political figures. Again, you can also read full texts by specific writers - Lenin is the most important figure and wrote a pretty manageable collection of things. But I\u2019d say you should learn basic viewpoints in Marxist politics, especially The Second International and the political traditions from the Russian Revolution through the end of WWII (Stalin, Mao, etc). If you can understand the differences between Lenin, Trotsky, Kautsky, Luxemburg, Bernstein, Mao, and a few others, you\u2019ll have a strong command of the traditions that inspired so many movements later.",

I think this provides a great base to learn from.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of lists of reading out there, they all generally have a good base of Marxism but will lean in one tendencies direction (like this is Marxist-Leninist-Maoist). Try to read from positions you don\u2019t overly align with to understand them, I\u2019m not a Trotskyite but I\u2019ll read his work for example. \n\nBest of luck comrade!",

May I please just request that from there, you move forward in time, and follow the progression of Marxist thought over the last century.  \n  \nI think after reading Lenin's IMPERIALISM, continuing on that topic through things like Walter Rodney's HOW EUROPE UNDERDEVELOPED AFRICA, and even Nkrumah's NEO-COLONIALISM: The Last Stage of Imperialism (though be aware that Nkrumah had some bad analysis about the National Bourgeoisie, and that fucked him in the end).  Finally, the works of Fanon, especially BLACK SKIN WHITE MASKS and WRETCHED OF THE EARTH are EXTREMELY important studies of colonization.  \n  \nFrom there, works from George Jackson and the Combahee River Collective are very important for gaining a more modern, expanded understanding of class.  \n   \nI also LOVE to recommend Glen Coulthard's RED SKIN WHITE MASKS as an extremely modern work that helps to frame and understand modern settler-colonialism as an expansion of Marx's primitive accumulation.",

Wagner, but in particular I would recommend Antiduhring as the most clear and concise statement of Marxist socialism.",
