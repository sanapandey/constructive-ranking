    "selftext": "As marxists we are well-acquainted with the idea that material conditions shape the dominant ideology in society, not the other way round. \n\nAs marxists we also know that it is not really worth analysing too much what a future classless, stateless, and communist society would look like, save for such musings being interesting points of discussion and imagination. \n\nHowever, there do exist some writings on possibilities of what such communist societies would look like. One good one is Trotsky's *Literature and Art*. Specifically in Chapter 8 \"Revolutionary and Socialist Art\" we find this striking quote:\n\n>All forms of life, such as the cultivation of land, the planning of human habitations, the building of theaters, the methods of socially educating children, the solution of scientific problems, the creation of new styles, will vitally engross all and everybody. People will divide into \u201cparties\u201d over the question of a new gigantic canal, or the distribution of oases in the Sahara (such a question will exist too), over the regulation of the weather and the climate, over a new theater, over chemical hypotheses, over two competing tendencies in music, and over a best system of sports. Such parties will not be poisoned by the greed of class or caste. All will be equally interested in the success of the whole. *The struggle will have a purely ideologic character*. It will have no running after profits, it will have nothing mean, no betrayals, no bribery, none of the things that form the soul of \u201ccompetition\u201d in a society divided into classes. [My emphasis]\n\nLet's read that again: \n\n\"*The struggle will have a purely ideologic character.*\" \n\nWhen there are no classes, no states, when poverty, war, and exploitation are so far in humanity's past that the concepts are almost folklore, could it really be that the driving force of human history would be ideas and not material forces? In other words, that an idealist view of history will supercede a materialist view of history? \n\nOf course, *if* such a future history is determined purely by ideas, then that would only be possible on the material basis of a communistic mode of production. So an idealistic view of history would have a material basis, which is in keeping with historical materialism. \n\nAnd this contradiction would of course be entirely in keeping with dialectics.\n\nThoughts? \n\nThe subject fascinates me. I love pondering about what human culture would look like far into the future of a classless world society, where things like class society are by that time \"ancient\" history and social classes and all the horrors that come with class society are so distant that they're not even in cultural memory anymore. \n\nPerhaps a subject for Marxist sci-fi writers! But I'm also looking for a serious answer to my title question: Would a stateless and classless communist society lay the material basis for ideology actually being what determines historical development? I.e., is the idealist view of history \"correct\", just not in our epoch and not in past epochs, but potentially in future epochs if material conditions allow it? ",

Just as material conditions shape ideology, ideology shapes material conditions, it's just that material conditions *precede* ideology. \n\nWith that in mind, we can also resolve your supposed contradiction as in your proposed future it would still be the material conditions that allow people to wage their struggles on an ideological level (because there would be little material struggle left). \n\nMaterial conditions would just kind of take a back seat, as they would be close enough to perfect to not be something to worry about all the time, but if they were to change because of, say, an alien war, they would still shape our ideas (\"we can't have this art program anymore, we need the resources to build weapons\") more than the other way around.",

How would a materialist view of history not still be relevant in this case?\n\nIt seems more to be saying that how our worldviews or future politics would develop would be more based on pure ideas and aesthetics than on different aspects of class struggle. We would still have different lives, different t communities would have different interests but politics would be mutual and ad hoc rather than an entrenched battle for dominance in order to maintain a specific social order benefiting one class over another.\n\nWe would be freeing art and aestetics to be reflections of individual ideas and dreams and wants in building a free world for ourselves.",
