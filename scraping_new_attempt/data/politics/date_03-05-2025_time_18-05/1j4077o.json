Your guy began work to refit Guantanamo into a concentration camp a few weeks ago.

I'm sure you're aware, you just don't like the word \"concentration camp\" because historically they never go well. But I don't know what to tell you there. That's objectively what it is. You need to make an argument for why this one won't end up like the others in history. You can't just, as you say, flat earth it and pretend it's not real. \n\n> It is an issue for female athletes and they have made that known publicly. You can look at the polls on this it\u2019s out of touch.\n\nIt's not. Talk to the actual schools where it's happening. The actual athletes are overwhelmingly positive on it. Why do you think you, most likely an adult man who is not involved in girls sports, knows better than them? Overwhelmingly, no one involved cares.\n\nAnd again, why is this so important to you that you're willing to vote in a guy who has been tanking the stock market with senseless trade wars with allies who we already have a great relationship with? Why are you willing to backstab Ukraine over trans people? Why are you willing to hand over complete control of government money and data to Elon Musk, an unelected beaurocrat? Why are you ok with the president trying to take control of the FEC? Why do you want to burn the country down over trans people?\n\nEven if we entertain your ideas, how does that lead you support the liquidation of the US government and cutting of international ties? Lets assume for a moment that we go even further than what you suggest, and schools start allowing male identifying, cis boys on the girls sports teams. That's your argument for installing a petty dictatorship and eliminating democracy? We need tyranny to keep them from doing that, no matter the cost?\n\nReally?",

You don't care about any other healthcare need a prisoner receives.\n\n2.  You don't care that we do shoulder some burden of responsibility for the people placed in our custody - custody being a key word denoting that even though they are imprisoned they still get a level of care \n\n3.  People saw 8 \"Kamala Harris gives sex change surgeries to prisoners\" commercials per NFL games before the election.  There have only ever been 3 gender affirming surgeries for federal prisoner.  It's the stupidest outlier of the entire Trump campaign.\n\n4.  This was DOJ policy during the Obama, Trump, and Biden eras and you didn't care then.  Once again, that's 3 gender affirming surgeries this entire time.\n\n5.  These prisoners have gone through every intervention and avenue possible prior to getting a surgery that has a smaller rate of regret than surviving heart attacks, hip replacements, pacemakers, ACL repair, LASIK, and Harry Potter tattoos.\n\n6.  These prisoners are also excellent case studies for the exact need of gender affirming care - the first one being a reformed former head of the Aryan Republican Army who robbed banks to help plan and finance the OKC Bombing.  This person has always been trans and felt outcast enough to even join the neo-Nazis (while hiding and denying their own expression for years).  Destigmatizing being trans can save lives and change fates and the denial of being trans and the resulting side effects is what the gender dysmorphia diagnosis persists of - denying it is the mental illness, not being trans itself.\n\n7.  Gender affirming surgeries for federal prisoners is, believe it or not, fiscally conservative.  Trans people are the most murdered demographic in America outside of prison, even more so in prison.  Gender affirming surgeries keeps the patient alive and unharmed rather than victim of attack after attack after attack.  One surgery vs multiple health emergencies, that's already a savings.  Then there is also the civil rights lawsuit liability - surgery is far cheaper than being sued for negligence or denial of rights resulting in injury or death.  \n\n8.  The narrative that a man is going to get a sex change operation to go to women's prison and be a sexual danger is laughably stupid and bigoted.  With what penis will this vetted long time model prisoner be defiling the women's prison?\n\nIt's making a bigoted mountain out of a cost effective and humane ant-hill.",

The attacks and rhetorics surrounding non-cis groups and individuals is sadly one of several blemishes America wears and needs to continue progressing on. I do believe it can only be done correctly together, difficult as that may be. While there's a lot of loud vocalization coming from that side I want to try to assure you many Republicans also do know and love and accept non cis people in their families or schools/workplaces or neighborhoods, but it's a big issue that so many can't or won't.\nI would appeal to you then to target to specific persons who have spoke or acted against your morals and seek representation and community as much as you can. If nothing else, to keep that vantage that most people in person do and will care about you, regardless of politics or even moral teachings they grew up with. We as individuals can hate or we can love, and either way we will make it an example for others. I think you're probably a loving person. I hope that's the example you can set for others. If they hate, thats's their choice. you must make your own.\u00a0",
