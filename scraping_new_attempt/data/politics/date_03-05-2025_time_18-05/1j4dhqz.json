Trump was gonna spit bile and venom regardless of whether they sat and listened or left. So giving him audience benefited no one. But being there could have. When Green got pulled, another dem should have stood up and spoken up. And when they got escorted, another one, then another, until the last. \n\nAnd yes, they would all have been escorted out and Trump would still have spewed all his bullshit. But he would have been severely delayed. And the optics of the democratic party might have shifted.\n\nInstead, they look like a bunch of cowards who let one of their own stand alone.\n\nI've defended the party until now because they have no political power. And while that's still true, last night showed they have no political backbone either.",

Republicans are literally hiding from their constituents over this mess. We all are keenly aware and hyper critical of the fascist regime and unelected asshole collapsing our system of government.\n\nBut we are also keenly aware of a group of people who claim to rep us but also seem disturbingly unaware that our system of government is collapsing. \n\nDems aren't being blamed for setting the place on fire.

The 2026 midterms will be friendly at least in house elections for Democrats.  I do worry most about propaganda though. I feel like the conspiratorial and hateful mindset of the right will just continue to proliferate into the next presidential election.  I'm not sure if a Trumpless GOP would win though.  But, it's clear that the combination of talk radio, Fox News, social media, bro podcasts, etc. have really shifted and amplified this conspiratorial, never trust any experts mindset.  Perhaps, if the consequences are severe enough, that could change, but they'll likely find a way to blame the problems created by Trump & co. on some shadowy liberal elite.",
