Boycotts don\u2019t work if the thing you\u2019re boycotting continues on its merry way without you. Ceding a position of opposition is *not* what we want here.

Instead we get the rest of the Dem block sitting around silently with their thumbs in their asses, looking complicit.",

I think those are symptoms of the problem. The root cause of the problem is that people in America are poorly educated, mentally slow, and emotionally tired.\n\nI think it would be much more effective for the Democrats to organize an educational campaign, specifically targeting the stupidest people in America. Get yourselves on every single channel, start podcasts, do whatever it takes. Play dirty- pretend to sympathize and then steer them towards educational material. Do whatever it takes.\n\nShowing up to the SOTU and wiggling your cane isn't a protest. I don't even know what he said, and if I did, would it matter? So, you disrupted. What'd you gain? What idiot did you educate?",

It has absolutely no chance of winning with how racist and sexist this country is but a President AOC VP Crockett is the perfect ticket. Neither of them would take any bullshit nor kowtow to billionaires and neither would be satisfied with merely returning to the status quo.\n\nI see so many americans saying \"Oh if only we could get things back to normal\" nah fuck that, American normalcy led to this. We need to go so far in the other direction we make scandinavian countries blush with how far left we go. It will never happen in this timeline but damn the one where it does has got to be amazing. Universal Healthcare for all. Equality for all. Lifesaving medical care isn't banned. Government gets actual oversight committees that route out corruption. They appoint at least two far left Supreme Court Justices because they aren't pie in the sky centrists like Biden thinking we need to compromise with fascists.\n\nIts impossible but imagine a world where we had President AOC(yeah shes not old enough but imagine) the last four years. Trump would have been behind bars within a year of january 6th. She would have actually messaged well and shown the American people how much she helped them. A  blue wave would have manifested and with no trump at the helm the maga cult would have been obliterated.\n\nIn that parallel world our most pressing concerns would be working with all our allies on climate change.\n\nNo threatining our allies. No tarriffs. No cratering the economy. We'd probably be most of the way to implementing universal healthcare and having the most recovered economy post covid by spades.",

I often read critiques of Harris's campaign on Reddit regarding her lack of policy. People point to that as the reason why she lost. I find that claim hilarious because Trump never talks policy. He never mentions it. The only policy topic he ever mentions is deporting illegal immigrants. Everything else is just \"concepts of a plan\", and we'll hear about it in \"two weeks\". It's like Stalin with his five-year plans. Nothing ever came of it. The point is Trump didn't win the election because of his robust policy proposals.

If you're waiting for authoritarian followers to have a \"Come to Jesus\" moment and realize that they fucked up, you're going to be waiting a very, very long time.

Some. But not many.\n\nTo admit this has been all a terrible mistake, that they've devoted themselves to a lie? It's akin to a kind of ego death. Their chosen leader *is* their personality. He is their everything. If they admit that they were bamboozled and their zealotry misplaced, they effectively have to rebuild their entire worldview from zero.\n\nAnd as people who crave reassuring structure and hierarchy in their lives more than anything else, this is something they simply cannot do.",

If someone refuses to trust you there's nothing you can do for them because they can *always* find a reason to doubt you. There can always be a deeper conspiracy, more gaslighting. You can lead a horse to water but cant force it to drink.\n\nThe best we can do for them right now is to essentially just politically overpower them and make the world a better place *regardless* of them. That means empowering and motivating voters that havent been interested or able to vote, or are already disliking the current administration. We have to *have a better option* for them to take when they look for one, and inform people of those options.\n\nSome of these rightwing people will settle down when the world doesnt end with a D president and will become apolitical. Some will genuinely change their minds. Some will stay mad until the day they die. We can have support networks for those that look for them, we can dismantle the things that lead to brainwashing, and we can attempt to reach out on a personal level occasionally, but that's about it. The rest is up to them.\n\n(the dismantling of brainwashing is incredibly important. Places like FNews keep people perpetually mad intentionally because it makes their beliefs more resistant to outside challenges. Their beliefs are based on emotion, and without places to refresh that emotion the belief slowly loses steam. There is no logic or sound reasoning to fall back on to keep the belief strong. Without a source of anger, many would potentially calm down and slowly open to reason. Lots would still refuse, but we could save some.)",

If we are indeed in the midst of a fascist takeover, then it would seem to me that there are virtually no limits on what sorts of acts of resistance are acceptable: up to and including an outright armed insurgency or something and literally every option short of terrorist attacks on civilians would seem like they're on the table.
