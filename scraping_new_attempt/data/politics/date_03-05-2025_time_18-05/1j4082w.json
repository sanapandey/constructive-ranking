Treaties entered into with one admin can be worth nothing after 4 or 8 years.\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time until USA loses its dollar supremacy.",

It was propaganda. Acknowledging that means admitting that many voters (or non-voters) were misled, and no one wants to hear that. People don\u2019t want to be told they were fooled or insinuated that they were idiots. They don\u2019t want to confront the idea that they were the ones who fell for it. Even when it's the truth, saying it outright is self-sabotage.",

I deal with a lot of people who have messed up, and most of the time, it\u2019s not a big deal. What fascinates me is how often people use a passive voice when bringing up a mistake. In simple terms, they say things like \"This happened\" instead of \"I did this\". There\u2019s no risk of getting in trouble or losing their job. Nothing is at stake except their pride.\n\nIt\u2019s almost disarming when someone just comes to me and plainly says, \"I messed up and need help.\"",

It's best to think of the Trumb administration as an earthquake that happened (and is still happening) way off shore which is going to produce a tsunami that will eventually hit. Some people live on the shore and absolutely are going to be decimated if they don't start making changes (the poor/destitute/sick). Some people are close to the shore and will definitely be affected once the tsunami makes landfall but will probably be able to survive through it (majority of people). Some people are fairly far inland and will only be indirectly affected by it (probably mostly white people with good savings and no debt). And some people are living on a mountain and will not be affected by it much at all outside of watching everything happen (the rich mostly fit here).  \n  \nThe media is complicit in not sounding alarms to warn people of what is coming. The government bodies that were put in place to help prevent tsunami damage (i.e. levees built over time) have mostly been hollowed out and have no actual power to do anything. But they still look like they are in place to most people and so anyone screaming \"Run for the hills, a tsunami is going to kill us all\" ends up just looking like a crazy person screaming about the sky falling.\n  \nSo to go back to the original comment of \"Why aren't people fighting for the lives yet?\"... Until the water starts hitting people's feet, you won't see any form of MASS action taken by large groups of people. And as we all know from history, that is generally at a point where it's too late to do anything as it means the tsunami is there and will soon cover everything with water.",

Even gave her an example about how my own mother had to perform 2 abortions 2 years after i was born for health reasons and how she would not be able to do it if trump had his way. Some people really are clueless about the whole thing.",

It's the greatest tool of propaganda mankind has ever created and it's being wielded against the citizenry before we've had a chance to collectively stop it with regulations and government action.\n\nIt's very difficult. I think that running on a message like that, regulating social media to stop disinformation and division so we can save ourselves, would be a winning one that does a lot of good, but social media is *the* place to get your message out now. It's not going away. So how do you spread that and get support when Zuck or Elmo can just order an engineer to silently and clandestinely change the algorithm to silence you?\n\nHank Green had a video a while back where he drew some parallels with media revolutions and the rise of populism. The two examples he gave were radio and the printing press and how populism (\"the people\" vs \"them\") starts as a marketing strategy but problems really start when populism becomes the policy. It grows when the critiques of institutions are deserved, and the critiques of media and an unresponsive government are. With the printing press, Martin Luther started handing out pamphlets to spread his populist message. The Catholic church was very deserving of the criticisms and the Protestant Reformation did eventually lead to the Catholic church reforming itself to address those. It also led to 300 years of religious wars, costing the lives of millions, as well as widespread pogroms & lynchings of Jews due to Martin Luther's populist antisemitism.\n\nI agree with Hank. Will we be able to come out the other side of this media revolution in a few decades? Or will we be killing each other for centuries over minute differences while we're steered by shadowy algorithms that direct our collective ire?",

We, as in the public, don't have an idea cemented in our minds of what social media as an institution should be and what regulations should look like. That makes it hard to gain support. Additionally, like I mentioned before, you're basically relying on the goodwill of the people you're trying to regulate in hoping they won't stamp out your message.\n\nFor regulations, how do you do it without trampling free speech? Where does the line lie? Personally, I think that section 230 already qualifies social media sites for regulation, but many would disagree.\n\nFor reference, section 230 is what makes a site not liable for what others post on it. It's why facebook/reddit/whoever doesn't get sued if someone finds something illegal on there like CSAM. That's very important for the internet, but the limitation is that they're not liable as long as they're not editorializing. A newspaper editor chooses what to show you, so that paper is liable for what they put in it. I would argue that since social media websites are now using algorithms to actively choose what to show you, instead of timelines or something based on user chosen topics, that they are in fact editorializing - Each person's feed is its own \"newspaper\" that has been edited and filtered for what that site decides to show you. I think they should have to bear the responsibility of the damage that causes, or go back to non-algorithmic feeds that don't actively filter content for you.\n\nThat seems to me like a very simple, prudent, and practical way to fix the biggest problems with the institution. However, there are plenty of people who see that as an unacceptable compromise and don't believe there should be any regulations on social media or only see the seeds of government controlling available news.",

Many many many millennials and younger live with a couple of months savings, and many are just legit paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHealthcare is tied to your continued employment, which your employer can and will fire you from for any or no reason (including being too politically involved). \n\nSo a huge part of the pissed off electorate has to balance the risk of losing their entire livelihood, healthcare, and probably housing with the nebulous need to stage demonstrations that may or may not accomplish anything. And other than for cops, collective bargaining is impotent and often non-existent so you can't even organize.\n\nThat calculus is pretty goddamn obvious for people who see the admin's damage as a looming iceberg off in the distance but not yet here.

My home state alone is bigger than the entire country of France. Add to that the myriad militarized police forces throughout the country that gain more and more social and legal support despite their brutality and have itchy trigger fingers, the lack of experience or leadership that could give us a better sense of direction or cohesion (we've never had a dictator before), and a complete lack of social safety nets that would afford people the time and effort it would take to organize, and you have a country filled with pissed off and scared people who are either unable to participate or completely unaware of what they can do.\n\nIt's really easy to sit from outside the country and judge us for not doing enough, but just know that it does absolutely nothing to help us, either. Those of us who did not vote for this shit are losing our minds with fear and anger. We don't know what the fuck is going to happen to any of us, our families, our children, our siblings, our parents.

Most of us have families that depend on us. Livelihoods getting destroyed to march in the street.\n \nIt's one thing to say \"why aren't you fighting for your lives rn?\" because you're the not the one going to get their head knocked in by a cop, detained for weeks or months, or end up on the street during winter; that has 0 impact on anything going by performing for a camera.\n \nI'm on probation. I get arrested, I go to jail. My dog ends up in a shelter. Everything I have gets taken. My mom is in a nursing home on Medicaid, so my family and I will be directly affected by the insanity going on. I'm trying to hold on to what little I have, and yet I still show up when I can.\n \nSo tell me, what would you do? What does \"fighting for your life\" look like in America? I donate to causes. I try to help organize. I show up for local protests. What more would you have  anybody in the same position do?",

We have 350k+ people. 290k of them are adults, ~60k are seniors and I'm not expecting seniors to go out in the cold/rain. That's 230k left. The median income is $37k. That's barely enough to live on. That leaves about 115k barely making ends meet. 37% of them have children at home who depend on them. that's about 70k people who make enough to barely survive and dont have children depending on them; within 83sq miles. \n \nI get that big shows of protest look great on the media, but they literally dont give a shit. The head of the RNC already told reps to cancel townhalls. \n \nWe're not here to please Europeans' idea of effective government resistance. Maybe that shit works in France. It doesnt work here.",

There was documentation for how horrible that was only because of the description of the family home in the local paper when it was torn down in the mid-20th century. Meanwhile I have distant family that had enough land for their name to appear on a map around the time of the civil war and yet swear up and down they were simple farmers with no slaves. They are blind to the truth because enough has been lost for propaganda to fill the gaps.\n\nWe are spoiled rich kids that want to act like gangsters in the movies but have no real clue what that entails beyond the costumes. We talk a good game but when push comes to shove we sit down.\u00a0\n\nI hope y\u2019all are able to remain a beacon of light and like another poster said I hope we make it to the end of this dark tunnel and come out the other side as allies again.

One of the major issues with the 21st century, in general, is the lack of community and connection with one\u2019s neighbor. \n\n\nMost people don\u2019t know their neighbors or even talk to them. \n\n\nI just moved from LA and hell, people didn\u2019t even smile let alone acknowledge you as you walked by. Even in the early 2000s, people still did this. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not some \u201c1970\u2019s, back in my day\u201d nostalgia. \n\n\nI really believe the internet fucked up a lot of people. Not just things or processes, *people*. \n\n\nThe internet has led to military coups and genocides on such a short timeline, it\u2019s astounding really. \n\n\n\nWith that said, we\u2019re starting from a bad place. \n\n\nImagine it\u2019s 1000 AD and you\u2019re in NA in any given tribe. At the time, there were 10s of thousands of tribes spread out across mainland North America. Now think about trying to rally tribes from what is now Maine, all the way down to Florida and be like \u201csome of those tribes on the west coast are annoying, let\u2019s off them.\u201d First of all, they\u2019d probably have no idea of each other, or the tribes 3000 miles away (crossing other tribes territories, mind you, to do whatever they had planned) but their customs, practices, and languages are so different from each other, that just the mere organization of the aforementioned groups would be near impossible. \n\n\nThat probably would have been an easier task than rallying people in my current neighborhood to fight against this Trump government. Of which many people are not part of. Unless you are a billionaire, you\u2019re basically getting fucked over like the rest of us. At least financially. \n\n\nSocially, it\u2019s a lot more varied but at the same time, that\u2019s what keeps the disconnect: the constant othering. \n\n\nNo war but the class war. \n\n\nAt no time in history was there ever a \u201cpeaceful take back\u201d of an extreme government. With risk of getting banned *again*, violence, historically, has been the only answer. \n\n\nSince no one is brave enough to do jack shit, we\u2019re all going to just walk right into this. Some of us are aware but powerless. Some don\u2019t care and will let apathy rule the day. And some are the ones orchestrating all of this and want it to happen.",

This completely contradicts Trump's claim that the US is \"getting ripped off\"; in reality, they have more than their fair share of global wealth.\n\nAnd this is only for the G7, worldwide the US gets an even crazier disproportionate share. The countries who manage to provide somehow better public services and infrastructure do it not because they are wealthier, it's because there is less rampant profiteering and legalized corruption. In the US, when corporations want something illegal or immoral to be permitted, they simply throw money at political candidates and parties, who then change the laws ([or interpretation of the law](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/epa-ruling-sewage-water?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)) to make it legal.\n\nThe reason the average American gets less, despite living in the wealthiest country on the planet, is that they are being exploited by their own system.

No dude, we got lucky after world war 2 and then through engagement with the world and alliance building we got rich and powerful.  There is nothing special about Americans, in fact on balance they are unhealthy, uneducated and completely incurious about the world beyond their reality television pro-wrestling and political theatre.  US power boils down to alliances with other rich and developed nations like Canada and the EU.  You would think that conservatives would, I dunno wanna conserve that position.",

I don't think anyone can argue with the fact that we can't continue down the path of increasing spending, quite literally every year.  The only argument to be made is on what do we spend on.\n\nOn that note, I thought your comment about the EU spending more on military was interesting, and I admit this is a generalization, but this sub leans left and spending money on military is generally not acceptable.  Being anti-Trump usually also means not spending money on military (again, a generalization on my part)",

Cook County, Illinois, would be a prime example of a solid blue metropolitan county. 35% of voters there, about 380,000 people, voted for Trump.    \n     \nThe rural county where I live doesn't have a town bigger than about 2,500 people in it. It's a pretty solid red county for the state I live in. 40% of the people here voted for Harris.    \n     \nThat's the reason why people have talked about any sort of instability being more like the Irish Troubles than our civil war in the past; because even in very red or very blue places, there's still a significant percentage of the population that's not part of the red or blue majority there. There isn't an even geographical distribution, and rural areas are just as divided as metropolitan. Give or take about a 10% swing from evenly split for any given area, rural or not, and that's the story across the country barring some extreme outliers.",

The US has been looked at as basically the \"world police\" in both a negative way and a positive way. This provided people with security. For example, the US Navy protecting the majority of the world's shipping lanes. And that the US has global access with planes/bombs.\n\nThere was always the threat looming of don't mess with the US because they will come for you. This was basically a promise kept via foreign policy and acting on threats. That kind of unraveled with the Obama administration drawing \"a line in the sand\" and repeatedly moving it as it was stepped over. Trump in his first term brought that back of peace through strength, where for 4 years a lot of conflict around the world stopped. Then when Biden took office, we saw it start again.\n\nSo I'd add Security. To your reliability and stability comment.",

Cavalry were faster infantry so when you have limited mechanization and need to move men around they are better than just having no cavalry.

The British won wiping out most of the German cavalry. Even on the western front generally cavalry was used as mobile infantry ergo you can easily and quickly move men up and then dismount and engage as infantry. Cavalry formations also tended to be able to quickly carry around lots of machine guns and light artillery so especially the British ones actually had decent firepower. (Main thing kills cavalry is expense of maintaining horses as fodder requirements and replacing horse stock was the bigger difficulty and by ww2 usually vehicles and mechanized forces by ww2 were reliable and frequent enough to be able to replace cavalry in combat roles though still usage by like soviets, Germans, (and lesser extent Japanese in say manchuria) for more rear line duties.",

The expense of maintaining cavalry for increasingly limited effect compared to vehicles is more of what killed cavalry. (I would argue light cavalry focused on rapid movement and engagement is more than horse infantry as they were able to both charge and or engage in a shooting fight with their heavier equipment so definitely still in the role of cavalry just not heavy cavalry which mostly died in the 19th century due both to costs of maintaining heavy cavalry and the increasing carnage of modern battlefields making the heavy lancer charge situational.",

But they've been fiercely backed because of Cold War posturing. So, one position is that, frankly, at some point China has to return them to the fold to finish that civil war. And that's... normal. The US wouldn't have accept it if one of the southern states, instead of surrendering at the end of their civil war, had just seceded. I'm sympathetic to China's view that having a tiny country off it's border that officially claims they are your legitimate government is nonsense.\n\nOn the other hand, Taiwan being a focal point for the cold war has allowed the losing enclave to develop it's own identity and position in the world. They feel like a country, act like a country and there's a solid argument they should be allowed to continue as a country (granted one where the locals have been completely subsumed by the exiles). They're not Chinese, they're Taiwanese.\n\nBut they should also drop their One China nonsense (which is in their constitution). It's never happening.",

They don\u2019t care to foster talent, try to suppress the voices of progressives. \n\nJoe Biden decided to run for a second term knowing that his approval rating was in the gutter. During his presidency he gave Kamala Harris a big role at the border, knowing that it wasn\u2019t a fixable issue or a visible role and would likely kneecap her if she ran.\n\nHe dropped out last minute because the corporate donors who hold our government hostage forced him to, not because of the garbage numbers.\n\nThen Kamala was picked and while she did the best she could, her campaign was not good. Her staff went on a podcast and said that the numbers never showed that Biden/Kamala would ever win against Trump, they also said that the numbers showed that Kamala needed to break with Biden on some issues and she **chose** not to, because of tradition. She then went on to say that we need to build the same border wall that she called racist back when Trump called for it, campaigned with Liz Cheney (???), continued to support Israel. In fact, her campaign has admitted that when they called people, if the person said that the Israel/palestine issue was a concern, they would throw that person\u2019s interaction out because they didn\u2019t want that to show as a problem. \n\nThe Democrat\u2019s strategy is to appeal to corporate donors and center right people who have made it very clear that they are never voting for them. I don\u2019t know why they keep trying. \n\nDonald Trump\u2019s win isn\u2019t that difficult to understand. People are tired of do-nothing centrists. And what are the democrats continuing to put forth? Centrist with a hint of LGBTQ+ in it. Nobody wants that. People want change and the only party that\u2019s offering that is the Republican Party. And to those stupid enough, that is a beacon of light.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t blame the voters for being apathetic or voting for Donald Trump at this point, I blame the party that does not want to materially help anyone, wants to continue campaigning on the same issues that they refuse to codify when they can, wants to keep taking donor money while lying to everyone and suppressing the voices of anyone who threatens the status quo.",

The second we found a Top Secret document in his possession he should have been arrested. But 'they' didn't want to give the appearance of trying to mess with the election. \n\nMerrik Garland dropped the ball so hard on the whole thing. He was Attorney General and just let it slide. \n\nThe NY state case for the hush money should have gotten him disqualified, but the courts dragged their feet on that one. \n\nAileen Cannon's fuckery with the documents case only helped Trump. But the courts didn't want to intervene. \n\nThe well was poisoned regarding election interference from Trump's whining all about the 2016 and 2020 elections. The Dems couldn't cry foul without the whole of the conservative movement spinning a whattaboutism from Trump's lies.\n\nBlame lies with a handful of Republicans too. I'm talking about Mitch McConnell's blocking Obama's pick for Supreme court a year before the election and then when Trump was in the same place they rammed through like 3 new justices that should have been held up for the same reason. And McConnell's fuckups with the impeachments, both of them. Collins and her wishful thinking that \"He'd (Trump) would learn his lesson while she didn't vote to remove him from office during either impeachment. Now the Supreme Court is full of Conservatives and they're going to rubber stamp anything that comes up that benefits Trump. \n\nAnd we've got Citizens United to blame for Elon's involvement. The amount of money he dumped into getting Trump elected shouldn't have been allowed to happen.\n\nSo, yeah, the system of checks and balances that we were all told were the failsafe of our system of government failed. It failed because it relies on both sides playing by the rules. The Republicans have said \"fuck the rules\" and the Democrats all say \"We need to be better than the Republicans.\"\n\nWas there fuckery happening with the 2024 election, almost certainly yes. BUT the problem is that now that Trump has gutted all the departments that would have been able to investigate it, we're hosed. We'll be lucky to have a fair election in 2 years.  \n\nWhat do we do now? I don't know. Ongoing civil protests are a good start. City halls need protests ongoing, County seats need them. State Capitals too. Most Americans need to take a vacation in order to get to DC to do any protesting there. And it's expensive. People don't have money to take a vacation they want to, let alone one to protest.",

You need to accept that in a free and fair election, this is what the (slim) majority of voting Americans wanted. Understanding that, you need to ask WHY those voters have arrived at that conclusion, and what needs to be done to bring them back. \n\nUneducated people just assume they are all racists, bigots, uneducated, stupid, etc and resort to petty verbal attacks against them not realizing that reinforces their beliefs.\n\nThe politically educated know the rise of fascism is due to decades of quality of life decline for the average person. People are rightfully angry they don't get the same economic opportunities their grandfather's did, and have to struggle to survive. Desperate people are the prime support base for fascism. To save them from fascism, you must increase their quality of life to a point where they no longer feel extremist acts of desperation are the correct choice. \n\nDecades and decades of trickle down economics and unrestrained capitalism is what led here.",

Like you, I do have elections in the future. But I am saying is that there's enough controversy on the topic, or at least different opinions, that I can see that being a wild plan an at some point the current term ends.\n\nYou're saying that it's obvious on its face that an amendment can't be ruled \"unconstitutional,\" and you're right. That was never explicitly codified because it's obvious. Seems like one of those cases where framers didn't think they had to say so obvious. I feel like we're seeing a lot of things lately that are founding fathers probably didn't imagine.\n\nSo while I agree with what you're saying, my point is that I would be a little bit surprised if this was an attempted power grab that wasn't taken.",

Pretty clear cut that this section applies to US citizens. \n\n> nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; \n\nNotice the lack of limitation on which people?

In law, jurisdiction is the place something happens in. In this case the constitution is clearly saying states can't make laws to take away equal protection **within the state**. \n\nSo the angle those conservatives are taking is stupid and not supported by any legal reading of the amendment.\n\nJust because \"some people say\" doesn't make their opinion valid.

No. America deserves whatever Trump and his corruption will bring us. 40% of the country didn't give enough of a shit to vote, but it's on me to protest? GTFO of here with that. I did my part.",

The way they move in unison, believe whatever they are supposed to etc is wild.\n\nTo be fair, I think our side conflates Trump *supporters* with people who voted for Trump because they despise our current system and were desperate for someone to change it up. The former group is legitimately mentally ill, but I think they're a *very* small share of his voters. From what I've seen in polls and just conversation, Trump isn't considered likable, trustworthy, or desirable even by most people who voted for him.\n\nThe problem is that people hate the status quo, people have felt held hostage by two awful candidates pretty much every election for decades, and our parties are refusing to supply any anti-establishment candidates. I'd argue the more anti-establishment candidate has won every election since the 1980s and anti-establishment furor has only grown over time. So when we're passing French Revolution levels of income inequality and the electorate is screaming for a change candidate...Dems give them Hillary, Biden, and Harris. The exact opposite of what people want. This leaves Trump as the only person they can vote for remotely on the anti-establishment spectrum, so they feel he's the lesser of two evils.\n\n>So many were ready and willing to get violent and throw away the country over it. They just don\u2019t have the same values.\u00a0\n\nI think this is a much wider share of the electorate than your framing acknowledges. This isn't a Trump voter thing. A *lot* of people have been reaching their breaking points. Just look at the Mangione shooting--that was widely celebrated on both the left and the right. Even before Trump, we've lived in a failing state and neither party seems capable of acknowledging that. Republican response was to deny reality and it got them taken over by Trump. Dem response was to pretend the establishment is peachykeen and just needs some minor harm reduction, and it got them beat by Trump twice.",

All the focus was purely on Trump when imo...the real story here is a rejection of Hillary/Biden 2024/Harris.\n\n* Hillary was one of the most widely hated political figures in America--and for good reason imo. The electorate was screaming it didn't like her (Bernie's support is best read as a protest vote imo). We ran her anyways and seemed to take her victory for granted against Trump when...she's the exact sort of candidate he's best against (low-charisma, pre-smeared, hyper-establishment bureaucrats).\n* Biden 2024 is probably the weakest presidential candidate in US history. Electorate was screaming no to a second term even in the 2020 primaries and the party just...tried to ignore them. After the debate, Biden was probably less electable than Will Smith right after the slap. Heck, I'd bet your average citizen off the street was more electable than Biden. *And* he's the type of candidate Trump is best against for the same reasons as Hillary. And then his economic messaging as our economy has been in accelerating decay for decades was basically \"the economy is great, you all just don't understand your finances\".\n* Harris 2024 never should've been chosen as VP--Biden's mandate was obviously to cultivate a successor for term 2 and she made zero sense for that pick, which makes me think he never intended to step down after term 1 in a display of shocking arrogance. She got nearly last in the 2020 primaries because she had no charisma--people make too much of her stances, but I saw her speak live and it was like a stand-up comic bombing. Biden promised to pick a woman, strongly implied he'd pick a black woman, and chose the weakest candidate on the field. *Biden* introduced the DEI candidate narrative. And she then was invisible at best while VP and was handed the candidacy after Biden refused to step down for so long that an actual candidate couldn't be find, setting up all kinds of unflattering narratives. She then ran as a hyper-establishment, status quo candidate who couldn't think of a thing she would do differently from her historically unpopular predecessor. So again...this candidate was made in a lab to be crushed by Trump.\n\nImo, these elections are all better read as rejections of the Dem candidates and the status quo than anything especially pro-Trump. For us hyper-political types, it's unfathomable because Trump is clearly so much worse. But our Dem party goes out of its way to give the worst impression possible to most voters and you need to be a high-information voter to understand we're actually a better party. Dems are a 3/10 party that looks like a 1/10, Republicans are a 1/10 that looks like a 3/10.\n\nGiven the awfulness of our candidates and how much we'd essentially given the electorate the middle finger by running them...I think we invited a heavy backlash. Partially out of spite, partially because people disliked Trump but just couldn't bring themselves to support our awful pro-establishment trainwreck and felt like they had to take a chance with Trump.",

And that's being charitable since the Republican candidate and right wing media repeatedly misinformed their own voters about tariffs.\n\nHere's a much better breakdown of [how Republicans feel](https://navigatorresearch.org/a-majority-of-americans-oppose-cuts-to-social-security-and-medicare/) about the policies Trump is pursuing right now. Some interesting things to highlight:\n\n* 83% of Republicans oppose cutting veteran's health care\n* 80% of Republicans oppose cutting Medicare\n* 74% of Republicans oppose cutting Medicaid\n* 70% of Republicans oppose pausing the CDC from investigating infectious diseases\n* 60% of Republicans oppose cuts to Head Start\n* 55% of Republicans oppose interfering with the FDA approval of childhood vaccines\n* 45% of Republicans, in general, favor reforming government programs rather than cutting them to make them more efficient\n* 40% of Republicans believe the Trump tax cuts benefit the rich and corporations more than anyone else\n\nAn even higher percentage of independents oppose those policies.\n\nIt's fair to say a substantial percentage of Trump voters *do not support many of the things Trump is doing*. In some crucial cases, like anything involving health care, the majority of Trump voters oppose these policies. If you're trying to say \"it's a surgery we've been fighting for\", the majority of Trump voters did not seem to understand what that surgery involved.\n\nI seriously, seriously doubt they understood the implications and were willing to put up with all of those things in order to (checks notes) eliminate the Department of Education and remove restrictions on raw milk. Hell, I would be impressed if even one in three of voters of any stripe could tell you what the Department of Education even does.\n\nSo maybe you're over there with your big brain thinking that destroying most functions of the federal government is going to be a good thing in the long run. But do *not* come in here and try to say Trump voters knew what they were voting for, understood the implications, and expected this level of pain. Most Americans don't know shit about shit and Trump voters are no exception.\n\n>That is the single biggest problem with the \u201cleopards ate my face\u201d style rhetoric.\n\nThe problem for you seems to be that it's embarrassing to see how misinformed or ignorant Trump voters are. It makes it hard to keep up the fantasy that there's a real plan and Americans are in favor of it when examples of Trump voters saying \"I didn't think it would be like *this*\" are a dime a dozen.",

I was talking with her about organizing, and she is a communications major who works for a national association, so she understands lobbying and the ins and outs of government and all that. I was saying we need to protest Trump, and she said that's too vague; that protests usually focus on a particular action that they want stopped or started. But he's doing so much crazy shit that it's hard to focus. By the time you latch onto something to protest, form a message, get organized, and plan an event, he's already said or done 10 even crazier things, and your message is now lost in the wind among a million other disconnected messages. Biden did maybe half a dozen stupid or shitty things during his term, so it gave the conservative media months to dwell on each instance and come up with messaging around it. We just can't keep up with Trump, and no one alive in this country today, unless they immigrated from an authoritarian country, has any experience with protesting an authoritarian regime. We have no idea where to start or what's reasonable because something like this has literally never happened in the history of the US.",

Cops still kill and torture with impunity and get away with it. A small amount of funding was moved away from policing for like a year in a few cities but came roaring back and police have never been more funded. \n\nBefore that was Occupy Wall Street, which accomplished nothing. Wall Street has never been screwing us harder. There were the big Iraq protests. They did nothing, we illegally invaded and were there for 20 fucking years. Vietnam protests had some more impact but not much, it\u2019s not like they brought the troops home a week after Kent State or something. The war fizzled out for military reasons not due to social pressure. \n\nThe last time protest really accomplished something big in the US was the civil rights movement, which had a relatively unified ideological front and a charismatic level-headed leader for the movement. We have nothing even mildly approaching one of those two things. \n\nSo I think a lot of people are wondering what the point of protesting will even be. I think things are going to have to get pretty bad and/or violent before we see people actually out in the streets.",

I'll donate time, money, and my presence when I think it's safe for me to do so, but I also don't want to risk my life for a country that also voted this fucker in.\n\nSo things will have to get a lot worse for the people like me, who just want to live their lives, to put them on the line.\n\nYou can disagree, you can hate it, and you can loathe me personally, but as much as I hate this administration I love life and my loved ones more.  I cannot throw it away, even for the 'right' reasons.  Not when my countrymen *asked for this*.",

Most people abroad don't realize how large we are as one nation. \n\nThere have been enough people protesting where they are that would seriously give a cause for concern. But not in the same way. \n\nTo clarify, it's costly to get to Washington DC for people from out West. That's roughly 3,000 miles (4,800 km) of distance to cover. Days worth of driving. No train routes which are faster than driving. Pricey flights. Then hotels, food, etc. all drive up the cost. Most people don't have the time off of work, and work is where you get your healthcare from. \n\nThe students and the young people who have the time to burn choking the capital up for weeks can't get there because of costs. It's expensive to exist here, and difficult to get around because we're so vast. \n\nMillions of Americans *have* taken to the streets. Just not the *same* streets. We're a very decentralized people, and that makes it harder to make a statement on this magnitude. \n\nThere's also the worries that this sad joke of an administration wants a mass protest so they can crack down with massive force. Claim civil unrest and stamp the last remnants of life from our failing democracy. \n\nWe're at the point, I believe, where violent conflict is inevitable. Nobody wants to start it because that's a crossing the rubicon moment. And a lot of us opposed to Trump have another concern about the start of violence.\n\nWhat if we lose?\n\nWe would have just handed Trump the excuse he needed to be dictator for life. We started a conflict which, as most civil wars and revolutions do, killed scores of innocents only to give rise to something worse than what was just overthrown. \n\nMost of the people I know that are pissed off about this are just scratching to hang on, or are afraid of what comes next should they act on those desires. I can assure you that none of us are sleeping well, and everyone is feeling a variable mix of despair, anguish, rage, hopelessness, and disdain.",

The difference is the people suffering and dying are the most defenseless people, not the ones who decided to participate in armed conflict, or at a minimum those deemed physically able to be a combatant. And I don't really see a hypothetical argument that somehow fewer people will be affected by the fascist policies they're enacting than would be by a civil war.\n\nPut another way, civil war seems like the preferable outcome to sacrificing a full third of the US population and watching disapprovingly from the sidelines. If the options are allowing the sadistic, needless social murder of 100+ million people vs an ugly military conflict that kills maybe 25 million (~1m deaths from the 1860s Civil War, scaled to today's population), I just can't see the argument against civil war.",

Health insurance companies are allowed to act more like cartels, maiming, murdering, and torturing tens of millions of Americans over the years. We surpassed French Revolution levels of income inequality years ago. White collar crime is completely out of control. Labor has been utterly suppressed most of my life--unions were barely holding it together in the 90s. The \"liberal\" party has had almost 40 years to respond to Reagan's plutocratic restructuring and the best they could think of was \"if you can't beat them, join them\". Oh, and our foreign policy has been in absolute shambles for about 23 years.\n\nEven before Trump, we were a failing state. And that's something we Dems are really bad at recognizing. We've been heading this way for a long time and I think a lot of us were hoping Dems could manage a controlled fall, or some sort of economic exit strategy to prevent all this. But both parties have completely failed in their own ways (Republicans more destructively than Dems of course), so it looks like we're going this route.",

But instead...we ran the most hyper-establishment candidates imaginable (Hillary, Biden 2024, Harris), campaigning on the status quo + minor harm reduction. We lost for obvious reasons. Many of us were hoping Obama would be that Change candidate, but it just didn't pan out for a hundred reasons.\n\nAt this point though...yeah, probably no way but through.

There is France which is undeniably pissed about that. There is Germany which suddenly is waking up to the fact they should also rearm. Then there is Poland, which always took this much more seriously than everyone around (including us).

During the Reagan years it grew even further to levels that are actually the highest we've ever had, including to this day. Clinton directed a massive effort within the Federal government to reduce some of those excess levels of staffing in a process that was planned out by each agency over a long period of time and implemented over YEARS, with the cooperation and participation of Congress.\n\nIf that were what Trump was doing, I might well question some of the goals and targets of the cuts, but I would have no problem with the overall approach.\n\nYou are comparing a bear hug to a gut punch.

The other day, he said that there's nothing either Canada or Mexico could do to avoid tariffs.  There's no articulated \"page\" for Canada to get on.\n\nWhen it comes to fentanyl, it's very clear that this was nothing but a pretext for Trump to declare an economic emergency that doesn't actually exist, thereby giving himself the power to impose tariffs.  The amount of fentanyl coming from Canada was already tiny, and even that has dropped by 97% in the past month. It's all lies from Trump.\n\n>We\u2019ve been getting boned for years on unfair \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements\n\nLet's see who negotiated those agreements. NAFTA came out of the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations. Clinton signed it, but only requested 2 small changes. As for the USMCA, let's see... what idiot could have been responsible for that?  Ah, right, it was negotiated under Trump's first administration, and he signed it.\n\nIn no way has the US gotten \"boned\" by free trade agreements.  Over the past 80 years, the pace of increasing wealth of the average American has been far higher than that of any other country. You have directly benefited more than anyone from the current global state of affairs. \n\nYou have been fed a pack of lies. I suggest that you educate yourself, because it's Trump who is selling you down the river, not the rest of the world.",

Expect increases anywhere 5-10% and an average loss of around $1800.\n\nBiden actually got bills passed, the Chips Act, Infrastructure, Green Deal....... Trump was never able to get anything passed his first term except for a tax cut. Trump is good at signing executive orders but poor at working with congress to pass lasting legislation.\n\nSo far he has alienated al our close allies and helped Russia so in that respect he has done more than Biden but not in a good way.",
