    "selftext": "  \nPosted by Emma Colton, for Fox News\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson had Rep. Al Green of Texas removed from President Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday after he refused to stop shouting or sit down.\n\n\"Our members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House, and to cease any further disruptions - that's your warning. Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the Sergeant at Arms to restore order to The joint session,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Mr. Greene, take your seat. Take your seat, sir,\" he added.\n\nGreen was removed and escorted from the speech by Sergeant at Arms.\n\nTrump had only just begun his speech when shouting broke out.\n\n\"To my fellow citizens, America is back,\" Trump declared after thanking the members of Congress and first lady Melania Trump.\u00a0\n\n\"Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden Age of America,\" he said. \"From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years. And we are just getting started.\"\u00a0\n\nThe audience was heard chanting \"USA, USA, USA\" amid the president's opening remarks.\u00a0\n\n",

But once you start disrupting the speech to the extent that it was happening, that\u2019s where the line is. \n\nAlso, once the speaker warns the members to behave, you know at that point if you continue that you will be removed. The speaker can\u2019t threaten and then not follow up. I believe that was Mr. Green\u2019s intent when he didn\u2019t stop, he wanted to be removed to become a \u201cmartyr\u201d of sorts.",
