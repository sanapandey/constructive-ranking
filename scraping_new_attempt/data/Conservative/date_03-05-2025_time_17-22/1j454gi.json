When I lived in Calif and was working, I preferred when it stayed light later.  It was no fun leaving work in the dark and driving in bad weather during rush hour.  Wanted to just go home, period.  When it stayed light for a couple more hours, I still felt like doing something after work, even if just to stop at the store.",

However, your employer is going to continue requiring you to be at work by 8:30AM. Meaning, tons of kids will arrive to school too early, and you'll still be rushing to get to work on time.\n\nThe one things DST does is keep us all on the same schedule.",
