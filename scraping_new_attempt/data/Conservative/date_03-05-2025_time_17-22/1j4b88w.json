But I get the feeling that during Trump 1 and the Obama years, they also didn\u2019t really get out this much. Like they were covered at times and maybe did an occasional interview, but not in the regular media talking to reporters. The cabinet too seems to be more out there and engaging",

He can only do so much as a single person but by having the VP and entire cabinet constantly engaging with the public and media they are able to keep pace with the media and not let them control the narrative.",
