I believe in non-violent protest, but some of the most successful and arguably moral protests in this country, civil rights movement, revolved around breaking laws through protest and then suing the government for unlawful actions. Public universities are not private they are in fact public land you can actively protest on and not be trespassed. Policy is not law and you can violate whatever policy you want and not be arrested for it. So, if you are standing on public land and protesting non-violently you are not breaking any laws, but yet that is considered an \u201cillegal protest\u201d?",

I've got real experience here.\n\nYou literally could not have picked a worse examples than quantum computing and AI. These are two areas where companies have been doing their own private and mixed sector research for longer than you've been alive. The entire field of computing is a direct refutation of your argument. You should actually try checking out its history. Bell and TI and IBM all have super interesting stories. Literally my own mother did research in university for IBM in relation to AI back in the 70s. The only area when the government has actually pushed the field rather than being pulled by it is in relation to military advances including space. Corporate grants are far, far more productive than federal ones. And the gap left by a withdrawal of federal funding is absolutely going to have its most useful bits backfilled by joint research between companies and universities.\n\n> We should not become a reactionary society\n\nYou are actively advocating for reactionary policies. Central planning is categorically reactionary. Markets are the organic process in contrast.\n\n> unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t align with people who want to see returns on their investments in their lifetime\n\nYou'd be mortified by how much research is doomed to not see returns *at all*.",

This is why almost all innovation in the sector is either private or hybrid. Federal money in hybrid projects simply subsidizes the companies that otherwise would be funding them. Purely public projects that are worth continuing have sponsors that are currently not funding them projects *precisely because* federal grants make it pointless. It's just another indirect subsidy -- if the work is meaningful -- or an outright waste that draws attention and money from more important work if it is not.",

That would mean it isn't valuable. People aren't willing to put their own skin in the game to see it across the finish line be it their time or money. That doesn't mean \"profitable\" -- obviously people spend their time and money on non-profitable or unprofitable endeavors all the time. That also doesn't mean all federally funded projects are devoid of utility. It's just if it would exist whomever would bear that cost doesn't have to because they're getting a subsidy.

From my view what you are talking about includes a lot of fundamental research in physics, chemistry, material science, mathematics, etc. these fields are old and not engineering focused so it is very difficult to determine how useful research in those areas are.

These fields have always advanced even in the absence of massive theft and spend programs subsidizing the companies that benefit off of that research. If it's important to figure out how to determine the atmospheric composition of a planet 10 light years away, why do you need to steal someone else's time/money to accomplish that? How do you justify that aggression? Wouldn't it be preferable to not steal the money and go without that information until someone deems it valuable perhaps in the pursuit of other goals?\n\nAnd a lot of times the answer is \"sometimes we do need to steal the money\" such as in the case of developing weapons of war so the country doesn't get invaded. But that's not really what we're talking about.\n\nYou don't have to answer if you think we've hashed this out far enough. I think I'm probably going to stop here myself.
