            "body": "As a resident of the UK, I can shed some light on this. \n\nThe UK has exported amazing and incredibly influential culture. The Beatles, Shakespeare, Harry Potter, and obviously so much more. \n\nThat being said, people in the UK are also incredibly socially conformist. Large swathes of the population still believe the media. Freedom of speech is all but outlawed. Two tier justice exists and is just the standard operating procedure of the state. DEI is bigger here than in the US. They are at this moment attempting to enshrine different standards of policing for minority groups vs majority groups at this very moment. \n\nThe state will, as in 1984, tell you to deny the evidence that is before your eyes and people will gladly do it. \n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been bombarded about how Trump is a Putin puppet, how Nigel Farage not being vehemently anti-Trump means he is also a Putin puppet, how Trump is bad because of the Zelenskyy meeting, so on and so forth. \n\nPeople in the UK live with the delusion of empire and relevance as a world power broker. You still have people that believe the UK can, \u2018stand up to China,\u2019 \u2018take Putin on,\u2019 etc. the sad reality is that the UK is a very poor country. It is a beautiful country and generally a pleasant and safe place to live (though that is rapidly changing), but it is a broke nation that simply doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nAt the moment, we are going through hell as the current electorate has forgotten what happens when you elect a Left wing government in the UK. We are taxed up to our eyeballs, our children are abused by migrants, we have thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants in hotels costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions, and so much more. \n\nWe also have a politics that is heavily shifted Leftward. Our Conservative Party has more in common with a socialist workers party than anything conservative. Our Labour Party is even further to the left and utterly incapable of sound governance as they are actually attempting to implement their ideology. Our Reform party is still a left wing party in many respects (despite the fact that they are labelled as Nazis). \n\nOur major leaders (Starmer and Khan and many more) are part of the Fabian society which has an emblem that is literally a wolf emerging from sheep\u2019s clothing. Their ultimate plan is to bring in communism via the back door. \n\nNot only that, but there is a complete ignorance of history and culture. Our Foreign Secretary claimed it was racist that the Vatican was creating black or white smoke during the papal conclave. Our quickly sacked PM Liz Truss was unable to name a favourite PM other than Churchill or Thatcher. Starmer said he has never had a dream nor has he ever read a novel. Our Deputy PM Rayner is a complete ignoramus and can barely string a sentence together. \n\nOur leaders are a direct reflection of the electorate. \n\nWe continue to become a more fractured, lawless, low trust, tension ridden society as enclaves of migrants post-97 have created a parallel law, society, culture, and community policing.\n\nWe have no military, we have no industry, we can\u2019t speak out, we have little money as prices continue to inflate across the board and our wages have remained stagnant for two decades. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to the UK. As a nation, it is likely finished. It could be turned around Andalusia style, but the current crop is trying to fast-track all of the illegal immigrants to citizenship so the leftist party is able to maintain governance forever.",

They have a hate on for what he's doing regarding Ukraine but Europe in general lined up for cheap Russian LNG AFTER Putin took Crimea in 2014.  \n\nThey kept on refilling Russia's war chest even as they mocked Trump for calling them out on it.
