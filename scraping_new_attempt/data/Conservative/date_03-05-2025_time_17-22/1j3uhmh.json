AL GREEN was interrupting, shouting, and waving his Cain! He got multiple warnings, along with all of the democrats and already ignorant people on Reddit are trash talking saying he was being silenced and blah blah blah. What did they accomplish? Other than looking like immature bratty children. \n\nEdit: Love how this has been \u201cSo heavily reported\u201d hmm wonder whose doing that and why? \ud83e\udd14 Lol",

If killed in a school shooting, there would have been thunderous Democrat applause to support their agenda of eroding Second Amendment rights. Murdered by an illegal? Silence. Absolute proof that murder victims NEVER matter to Democrats. If a murder moves their agenda forward, they are sad,, outraged, angry, and demand \" justice.\" If the murder doesn't move their agenda forward, they say nothing. There is no value to a human merely by virtue of being a human who has an inherent right to live. Humans only have worth based on their political value to a  Democrat.",
