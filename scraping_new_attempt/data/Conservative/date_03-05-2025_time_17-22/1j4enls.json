Softwood and dairy are examples of goods that are sold for which either country has a problem. The U.S. over subsidizes dairy and as lumber grows on crown lands in Canada, softwood mills in Canada have an alleged advantage over U.S. lumber, which is on private land. These are just two historic examples.",
