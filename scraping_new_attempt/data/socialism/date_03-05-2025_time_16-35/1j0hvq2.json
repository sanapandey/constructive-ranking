I agree with most socialist ideals, but in the end - I end up agreeing with the fact that the USSR has hurt many people (including my family tree). I still am convinced that all I need is a few books to make me more certain about my political stance. I think I'll get \"The State and Revolution\", but \"The Wretched of The Earth\" has been in my mind for a while. Is it worth my time?",

Fanon describes the mental effects that both the colonizer and colonized experience during this process. \n\nAt one point, Fanon shares the desire of one French officer who has been tasked with extracting information from Algerian prisoners, which included the use of torture. This French officer asked the psychiatrist to help him not feel empathy for those that he tortured as it was causing him great stress. Morbidly ironic, I know.\n\nFanon explains how as the colonizer dehumanizes the colonized, the colonizer, in turn, dehumanizes himself.",

Fitzpatrick is one of the most concise and informative academic works on the topic.\n\n\"The Soviet Century\" by M. Lewin is a Marxist critique of the Soviet project, which is heavily critical of Stalin and the bureaucratic nature of the CPSU. \n\n\"Life and Terror in Stalin's Russia\" by R. Thurston offers a more balanced and less vitriolic investigation into life for the average person during the Stalin Era.",

I would 100% recommend to read not only The Wretched of The Earth, but also his first work, Black Skin White Masks. Both are absolutely amazing.\n\nFun fact: The importance of The Wretched of The Earth is as important that Stuart Hall called it \"the bible of decolonization\". It doesn't matter if one looks at national liberation movements in Asia, the Middle East, or the Caribbean. Fanon is always there.",

Reading Fanon's works first (*Black Skin White Masks* and *The Wretched of the Earth* should suffice, although the others are equally interesting) prior to reading Said provides then the tools for a more critical lecture of Said's work. In fact, in this order, if you read Said further and also go through Culture and Imperialism (completely recommended!) you can then understand why he heavily draws in Fanon's work there, in order to limit the failures of his early critique of Marx(ism) in Orientalism.",

Not because the concepts are too hard, but more because you don\u2019t engage in the social behaviors that naturally drive someone to actually diverge ideologically from your current society. You accept the tenets of socialism without having properly experienced liberalism as an adult.\n\nThis is me preparing you for actually reading Wretched. It\u2019s probably going to be really abstract, because the book talks about a reality you kind of sit in between (that is, you\u2019re between the imperial core and the imperial periphery, coming from a post-Soviet state). \n\nI wish you luck. I hate holding the \u2018adulthood\u2019 card over you, but as someone who recently made the transition to proper adulthood, a lot more stuff is going to make sense to you once you start experiencing life as a working adult, which is who socialism is for",
