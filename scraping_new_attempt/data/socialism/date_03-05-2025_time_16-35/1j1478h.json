The welfare systems they have in place just aren\u2019t sustainable under a capitalist system where the capital class is still going to leech as much wealth as they can from society. Europe fell for the delusion of socdems who think you can somehow balance the will of the capital class and the proletariat, an impossibility considering how opposed their class interests are.",
