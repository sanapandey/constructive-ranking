    "selftext": "Hi my fellow socialists,\n\nI wrote an essay about the role of storytelling in stirring mass resistance. Our task as writers, artists and organizers resisting empire is to fight the state\u2019s abdication of responsibility by closing the gap of complicity. In other words, by telling compelling stories of how people\u2019s lives are entangled, we can combat cognitive dissonance and condition dissent.\u00a0\n\n[You can read it here.](https://hereandtogether.substack.com/p/now-is-the-time-to-write-for-our)\n\nIn this essay, I draw on social-psychological studies about people's tendency for obedience and what conditions offer a counterbalance, and takeaways from the tv-show\u00a0*Severance*.\n\nI hope my writing offers some confidence in the importance of continuing to take meaningful action, even when things feel hopeless. Our resistance is contagious and has ripple effects.",

            "body": "Thank you for the interesting piece. I agree with the argument that writing and creative work can still be a useful tool for spreading socialist ideas and challenging unjust power systems. However, I'm not entirely convinced by the Milgram study; there have been some criticisms of the methods and conclusions and the difficulty in ethically reproducing the results.\n\nFor example,\n\n\"Perry\u2019s re-analysis of the data showed that 'It\u2019s more truthful to say that only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real, and of those, two-thirds disobeyed the experimenter' (p. 163). Furthermore, she argues that many of those who did administer the maximum amount of shock did so because they were confident the shock wasn\u2019t real or that the experiment was an elaborate ruse.\"\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201301/the-secrets-behind-psychology-s-most-famous-experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201301/the-secrets-behind-psychology-s-most-famous-experiment)",

If someone can say \"America would never actually do that, Israel would never actually do that, our electoral system would never really allow a fascist to take control, our military would never really target civilians, there are checks and balances preventing that, the extremists aren't actually extreme, it's all a joke or simply rhetoric, etc.\" then it allows them to participate with less guilt because they don't think they're really supporting something terrible, even though they are.",

The style and substance of their opposition has really just kind of confirmed the worldview of Trumpism, that Donald Trump really is some sort of populist man of the people come to save the American working class from the evil globalist government bureaucrats. Even now, so many attacks by the Democrats against Trump are either from the right or just kind of an elitist nihilism. Any legitimate criticisms are then in turn rejected as just more of the \"liberal hysteria\" of the Democrats.",
