    "selftext": "My liberal Mom thinks China created COVID as a bioweapon against its own people to get rid of the elderly and disabled and it leaked out to the rest of the world by accident and they burned people alive in buildings to keep it from spreading (I love how that is now considered a liberal position). My brother is more open to being pro-China but is still skeptical as he\u2019s very much a liberal. I\u2019m planning on reading a book \u201cThe New China Playbook\u201d by Keyu Lin about how marvelous the economic progress China has made in the last 40 years has been. But they\u2019re both allergic to books on political theory. So if I recommend they read it, I don\u2019t think it would make them read it. But I have more faith in Tommy than I do in my Mom as he seems more open to China. And even my Mom is surprisingly anti-capitalist as she goes off on borderline Marxist rants about \u201celites\u201d and she even supports Luigi Mangione. She is so close to being radicalized.",

China learned from the failures of the USSR, and how their tense relationship with the West was key to its decline. The only way to connect with the rest of the world, which is capitalist, is to allow a limited, controlled version of capitalism to exist. \n\nThis has not only given them peace, but has given them foreign investment to speed up the uncomfortable development phase where workers have to suffer. Labor conditions in China are very different in this day and age compared to at the start of the century. This also gave them access to technology, otherwise unobtainable. This allowed them to reverse engineer to catch up and begin outpacing the West in innovation. \n\nWorkers did suffer, but the Communist Party evidently have put those profit in service of the people, not capitalists, proven by the elevated living standards workers enjoy in China compared to the rest of the Global South. 800 million were lifted out of poverty in 40 years. No country can boast an achievement nearly comparable to this for their working classes. \n\nAlso, no democracy? Why? Because the only form of democracy is the liberal multiparty democracy? The CPC has 100 million members. This huge fraction of the population is directly involved in politics. Not just that, but the CPC is connected to the grassroots in many ways. Their leaders are actually held accountable, and if they don\u2019t work for the people they won\u2019t get far within the party. Their system is not perfect, but all this is possible when you expel capital from politics. \n\nIf the CPC was not democratic they would not enjoy such rate of support from the Chinese people. China is more democratic than any country in the West. \n\nWhere do you get these numbers of over a million in reeducation camps? Are you aware there was a problem with extremism in Xinjiang? Isn\u2019t this a much better way to deal with the issue than with bombs and drone strikes like the West does?",

Do you really believe an oppressive capitalist regime would undertake policies like this? Mass mobilization campaigns? Not even in social democracies. \n\nWorkers in China enjoy a much better quality of life than others in the Global South. That is who you should compare them to because that is where they started. China has also done a proper job ensuring their entire population has access to quality education. As we see today, not all work in China is boring and repetitive, they are leading the world in technology. China has so many engineers and scientists they basically export them. \n\nInequality in China is not rising. Centralization of wealth in hands of the capitalist class is not happening. Their economy is becoming more publicly owned by the year. The numbers of billionaires [decreased by half](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/world-news/billionaires-list-shrinks-as-china-is-hit-by-economic-slowdown/amp_articleshow/116017881.cms) in the last two years. The [Gini coefficient](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=CN) is on a sharp decline.  The trend is clearly towards equality. \n\nDemocracy does not require a multiparty system. That is just liberal drivel with no foundation or basis. China has free and fair elections. Candidates can and are declined by the public. National elections are not pointless.\n\nThere is room for dissent in China. Not everyone is a Marxist. \n\n>> Fear is pervasive and everywhere\n\nThe f are you saying my guy. Straight up orientalism. Where do you get your information on China? Serpentza? Get on XHS and speak to actual Chinese people. Get off Western media. \n\nAgain, where is your source on 3 million people locked up in camps? Adrian Zenz? \n\nFreedom of religion is protected in China. Look up the mosques in Xinjiang on Youtube. No religion is banned or not allowed to congregate, except cults like Falun Gong. \n\nWhat do you mean by freedom of press? Private ownership of media companies? The f. \n\nFreedom of speech is restricted and rightly so. There is nothing as powerful and pervasive than the Western propaganda apparatus. Allowing its influence on your socialist country is suicidal. Look at the effect of Radio Free Europe. \n\nBe sure to include sources when making ludicrous claims.",

Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is their starting point in the party.
