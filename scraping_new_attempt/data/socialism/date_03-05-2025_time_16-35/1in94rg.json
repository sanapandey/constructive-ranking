            "body": "You'd probably still be able to get a decent bagel in Germany.\n\nReally though, one wonders what trajectory Japan, Spain & Italy would have taken. Realistically, I think you have an extreme reactionary response from the US, France & Britain, but this was also the furthest left the US had ever been in the FDR era, so it's *possible* this could have exported beyond Germany & spread to an International Workers' movement. \n\nJapan, though, would have always been tricky. I will always read/watch explorations on this topic, it's fascinating to think about.",

Basically a massive strike broke out across the USA where workers rather peacefully rose up and formed various communes across the country. They were sadly suppressed violently by the US army but I can't help but wonder what might've happened had they been successful. Still I think it's an interesting tidbit of American labor history that should not be forgotten.",
