The connection between fascism and capitalism seems to be extremely close indeed, which I have had an intuition of but haven't heard or read anything concrete about until now. I'm excited to learn more about topics and people in history that I know I'm completely ignorant of due to western propaganda. I also recognize that relying on just one book is not a sound strategy so if anyone sees this and has any thoughts on good reads to follow this one, please let me know!\n\nI also just read the PSL program which seems to me to be a really great overview of the state of things. I found it much more approachable than things like the Communist Manifesto which I admit I will need a few read-throughs to really understand. I'm very curious to hear if anyone has read it and has any critiques or things they'd like to add to the PSL program as an introduction to socialism.",
