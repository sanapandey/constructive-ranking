The loss of faith in the permanence of the system, the growing antagonism between the workers and the owners, and the realization that collective resistance is required for change all were the embryonic form of consciousness.\n\nFurther down, he writes that class consciousness can only be brought to the workers from without, as that workers are limited to develop only trade unions consciousness.\n\nWe see the rebirth of support for labor unions, with strikes and organizing campaigns in the news more frequently now than in the last 20 years.  We see the self organization of citizens to resist the reactionary government of Trump, and his cuts to healthcare and food aid to the most vulnerable of America.  We even see a growing antagonism against the wealthy and ruling elite; the support for Luigi, the calling out of Musks corruption by regular people.\n\nAre we in a situation in which Lenin describes?  Has the embryonic form of class consciousness formed in members of the American working class?  And if full consciousness must be brought to them from without, HOW?\n\nHow can socialists help workers over that final hurdle from embryonic or trade unions consciousness to full class consciousness?  Is it unions?  Educational or propaganda channels on social media?  Podcasts?  YouTube?  Walk the streets and just talk to people?\n\nIs my analysis aimed at the right direction, and if so, what can be done?",

What it means is to try, relentlessly and passionately, to teach the masses that everything depends on them; that if we stagnate it is their responsibility, and that if we go forward it is due to them too, that there is no such thing as a demiurge, that there is no famous man who will take the responsibility for everything, but that the demiurge is the people themselves and the magic hands are finally only the hands of the people.\" \n\nFrantz Fanon",

We call **communism** the real **movement which abolishes the present state of things**. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.\n\nMarx, The German Ideology\n\n>What we have to deal with here is a **communist society**, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it **emerges from capitalist society**; which is thus in every respect, *economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges*.\n\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Programme\n\n>In themselves **money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence**. They want transforming into capital. But **this transformation can only take place under certain circumstances** that center in this, viz., that **two very different kinds of commodity-possessors must come face to face and into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of production, means of subsistence, who are eager to increase the sums of values they possess, by buying other people's labor power; on the other hand, free laborers, the sellers of their own labor power and therefore the sellers of labor**. . . . With this polarization of the market for commodities, the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given. The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the laborers from all property in the means by which they can realize their labor. As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale.\n\nMarx, Capital\n\n>The **co-operative factories run by workers themselves are**, within the old form, the first examples of **the emergence of a new form**, even though they naturally reproduce in all cases, in their present organization, all the defects of the existing system, and must reproduce them. But **the opposition between capital and labour is abolished there**, even if at first only in the form that the workers in association become their own capitalists, i.e., they use the means of production to valorise their labour.\n\nMarx, Capital\n\n>The capitalist stock companies, as much as the **co-operative factories, should be considered as *transitional* forms from the capitalist mode of production to the associated one**, with the only distinction that **the antagonism is resolved** negatively in the one and **positively in the other**. \n\nMarx, Capital\n\n>**Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other**. Corresponding to this is also a political **transition period** in which **the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat**.\n\nMarx, Critique of the Gotha Program \n\n>(a) We acknowledge the **co-operative movement as one of the transforming forces of the present society based upon class antagonism**. Its great merit is to practically show, that the present pauperising, and despotic system of the subordination of labour to capital can be superseded by the republican and beneficent system of the association of free and equal producers.\n\n>(b) Restricted, however, to the dwarfish forms into which individual wages slaves can elaborate it by their private efforts, the co-operative system will never transform capitalist society. to convert social production into one large and harmonious system of free and co-operative labour, general social changes are wanted, changes of the general conditions of society, never to be realised save by the **transfer of the organised forces of society**, viz., **the state power, from capitalists and landlords to the producers themselves**.\n\n>(c) We recommend to the working men to embark in co-operative production rather than in co-operative stores. The latter touch but the surface of the present economical system, the former attacks its groundwork.\n\nMarx, Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional General Council\n\n\n>If cooperative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to supersede the capitalist system; **if the united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon a common plan**, thus taking it under their control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of Capitalist production\u2014**what else, gentlemen, would it be but Communism, \u201cpossible\u201d Communism?**\n\nMarx, The Civil War in France\n\n>The matter has nothing to do with either Sch[ulze]-Delitzsch or with Lassalle. Both propagated small cooperatives, the one with, the other without state help; however, in both cases the cooperatives were not meant to come under the ownership of already existing means of production, but create alongside the existing capitalist production a new cooperative one. **My suggestion requires the entry of the cooperatives into the existing production**. One should give them land which otherwise would be exploited by capitalist means: as demanded by the Paris Commune, the workers should operate the factories shut down by the factory-owners on a cooperative basis. That is the great difference. And **Marx and I never doubted that in the transition to the full communist economy we will have to use the cooperative system as an intermediate stage on a large scale**. *It must only be so organised that society, initially the state, retains the ownership of the means of production so that the private interests of the cooperative vis-a-vis society as a whole cannot establish themselves*. It does not matter that the Empire has no domains; one can find the form, just as in the case of the Poland debate, in which the evictions would not directly affect the Empire.\n\nEngels to August Bebel in Berlin",

The fundamental distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and a dictatorship of the other classes \u2014 landlord dictatorship in the Middle Ages and bourgeois dictatorship in all civilized capitalist countries \u2014 consists in the fact that the dictatorship of landowners and bourgeoisie was a forcible suppression of the resistance offered by the vast majority of the population, namely, the working people. In contrast, proletarian dictatorship is a forcible suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, i.e., of an insignificant minority the population, the landlords and capitalists. \n\n> It follows that proletarian dictatorship must inevitably entail not only a change in the democratic forms and institutions, generally speaking, but precisely such change as provides an unparalleled extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy by those oppressed by capitalism\u2014the toiling classes. \n\n> [...] All this implies and presents to the toiling classes, i.e., the vast majority of the population, greater practical opportunities for enjoying democratic rights and liberties than ever existed before, even approximately, in the best and the most democratic bourgeois republics. \n    \nVladimir I.

So far from promoting, they will continue to lay every possible impediment in the way of the emancipation of labor. Remember the sneer with which, last session, Lord Palmerston put down the advocated of the Irish Tenants\u2019 Right Bill. The House of Commons, cried he, is a house of landed proprietors. **To conquer political power has, therefore, become the great duty of the working classes**. They seem to have comprehended this, for in England, Germany, Italy, and France, there have taken place simultaneous revivals, and simultaneous efforts are being made at the political organization of the workingmen\u2019s party.\n\n\u2014 Karl Marx, Inaugural Address\nof the International Working Men\u2019s Association\n\n>*The state* is therefore by no means a power imposed on society from without; just as little is it \u201cthe reality of the moral idea,\u201d \u201cthe image and the reality of reason,\u201d as Hegel maintains. Rather, it *is a product of society at a particular stage of development; it is the admission that this society has involved itself in insoluble self-contradiction and is cleft into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to exorcise*. **But in order that these antagonisms, classes with conflicting economic interests, shall not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, a power, apparently standing above society, has become necessary to moderate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of \u201corder\u201d; and this power, arisen out of society, but placing itself above it and increasingly alienating itself from it, is the state**.\n\n\u2014 Frederick Engels, Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State",

Most Marxists and Leninists I speak are so wrong on many things about them. Imagine people who never read anything from them and only have the popular knowledge of mainstream education?\n\nAnd theories are far from being enough.\n\nWhen people find alternatives that pre-configurate socialist/Communist politics, economy and society in their community, as a better way to find solutions for what they have been struggling in our liberal society and government authorities, then people naturally will appreciate it, after experiencing it, seeing it works and how it works. It is more convincing and serve as examples to other communities. Then people start get educated even without reading theories.",
