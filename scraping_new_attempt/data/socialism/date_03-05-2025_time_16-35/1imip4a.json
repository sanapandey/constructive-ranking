    "selftext": "Mods, feel free to remove this if you consider it violating the submissions guidelines.\n\nI'm making a zine (basically a D.I.Y. magazine for those of your who aren't familiar) about fighting censorship. As a socialist myself, I want to get other socialists' opinions featured in the zine. I have no doubt that our political opinions are sometimes more subject to censorship and suppression than others. Feel free to write something in the comments or to send me a DM. You can choose one of these prompts (or just write whatever comes to mind when you think about censorship):\n\n* How have you or someone you know been censored?\n* How do you fight censorship?\n* Are there any situations when censorship is okay?\n* Why is censorship wrong?\n* How does censorship target specific communities?\n* How does censorship contribute to an authoritarian government?\n* How has censorship affected you personally?\n* What is your personal opinion on censorship?\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\nEDIT: also, if you send me pictures, I can add those to the zine as well.",
