            "body": "Harvey's intent is you read the various chapters of Capital first, rather than as a study guide where you'd read it in tandem:\n> My own readings of Capital, collected in the present volume, will prove far more enlightening if you have read the pertinent chapters beforehand\n\nAs far as structure, it's based off a series of lectures he gave each year on Capital, so you'll find it quite conversational in nature. Each chapter of the Companion covers multiple Capital chapters, and it just follows the main book's order rather than presenting things in a different order that might be easier to follow (like how people suggest starting with later chapters and such).",
