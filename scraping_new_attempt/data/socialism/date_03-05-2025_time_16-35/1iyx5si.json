With a lot of the cuts currently being made by musk it's puzzling to see so much support when cutting funding to Institutions that are fundamental to the day to day operations of the US, and even ones that aren't as critical such as the park rangers are still part of the reasons people visit the US and boost tourism. I understand there's a wish to cut unnecessary government funding but this is also an incredibly unstable way of doing it instead of properly auditing the system and making changes in a more methodical approach. I've seen more backlash from Republican voters but I've also seen a fervent support for him that's almost fanatical, do they truly believe trump is god or is there a cult following in which people are begging to reject the truth even if it hurts them? Is the right wing just more cohesive or is it just more akin to a cult?",

As a generation, millennials were really confronted with the reality that life on this earth is shit, we are all nothing more than meat in the grinder while an affluent few truly enjoy life. \n\nMany millennials like myself embraced radical leftism as a result. We were able to analyze why the world was shit and what should be done about it to make it better.\n\nBut many millennials embraced a sort of Joker-esque futilism, an understanding that the world was shit and a desire simply to see it burn, because anything is better than how it is. Some of the more intelligent ones were able to capitalize on this disenfranchisement - professional grifters - who further snowballed this sentiment into a petty, toxic and narcissistic movement of people who's entire identities are enjoying other people's suffering.\n\nSo no, there is no longer any right-wing ideology. Ironically, I just listened to an interesting radio segment on some public radio station from the perspective of the \"schism\" within the Murdoch family on the eve of Rupert Murdoch's forthcoming death, and how many in the family - Rupert included - have abandoned any and all ideological positions they had previously and have fully embraced the pursuit of simply vilifying and demonizing anything considered 'left'. \n\nIn my personal opinion, we have seem the collapse of conservative politics in the face of the crushing weight of contradiction. Reactionaries have now embraced a more pure and visceral anti-progressiveness for the sake of misery and suffering, and a willingness to forge a world in which the misery truly becomes the point.",

Their whole volk thing and how they said it wasn't about class or wealth? The guys on the ground went against their class interests in the name of some fictitious service to the state and nation. In reality, they were transformed into glorified slaves for the capitalist class. The same thing is happening here. They are being asked to sacrifice for faith, fatherland, and their in group. It is violent chauvinism.\n\n\nBy selling people the idea that they are in crisis and that they are losing their sense of identity and purity of their society, that democracy has failed them and they need tyranny and a strong hand to purify the country and restore their sense of identity, Trump has manipulated the people against their own interests. Many people, once compelled by these arguments, are willing to sacrifice their freedom for an answer to the perceived injustice. (And in reality, there is no injustice. Any correction to unjust power is seen as unfair and a loss by the privileged, since that is what they are used to having.)\n\n\nSome people have a type of personality which caves to authoritarians, while others rebel. Those who cave tend to feel a deep internal sense of fear and distrust of outsiders. They strongly need to conform. They are the types to side with a bully, even if they themselves are bullied.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's what you are seeing happening here.\n\n\nThe way to fight this is to remind people that we are all essentially the same and in the same boat. The capitalists do not actually care if you are a proud WASP. You are still just another tool for making them money. You have more in common with another worker of a different race or an immigrant than you do with Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They may be happy to punish the minorities, and to the footsoldiers, that may look like a special privilege for them, but it isn't. Behind the scenes, they are all being robbed and subjugated.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump is laughing his way to the bank, as we saw with his $50 billion gain from his memecoin. As for whether Trump is actually a fascist or not, I've seen people say he isn't one because he doesn't have to be one. He's using their rhetorical methods, but there is no left opposition to violently oppose him. Fascism was brutal and bloody because it needed to be to satisfy capitalist interests and crush opposition. The gloves don't actually have to come off here. He can skip ahead to the looting phase, since there is no communist army coming to fight him.",

In 2010 or so, the tea party folks made jokes about dismantling the govt and crushing liberals. Where we go in a few decades remains to be seen, but if the current path continues, I expect the anger from working people will drive action.\n\n\nAnd THEN, we will see an authentic fascist retaliation, perhaps.

Steve is a big fan of[ Strauss\u2013Howe generational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory) he realized that we are entering a period of Crisis when people want economic socialism, strong goverment, traditional values (actual traditional values).\n\nAnd just like the Nazi manipulated this sentiment. Not only is the feeling of crisis being amplified, but it's also being redirected.\n\nInstead of socialism, we are getting social-chauvinism => olygarchy\n\nInstead of stronger goverment, we are getting actual fascist\n\nInstead of actual traditional values, healthy masculinity, spending time with family, raising children...we are getting men which treat women like meat.

Which fueled the growth of the alt right... victimhood brigade pushed the pendelum to the right.\n\nNow this pendelum is coming back, really, really fast... the alt-right doesn't really give a fuck Trump is a billionaire throwing them cheap bones.

Majority is still supportive, what is being hated is Social-Chauvinism, like reverse racism... which is... well racism with extra letters.\n\nAlso I have no idea how much hatred immigration gets due to outright racism. And how much because certain groups are losing due to immigration (just like certain groups lose due to globalism), and people feeling like their race/ethnicity is being replaced by immigrants (does this even count as racism?)\n\nAnd yes, it's history happening all over again... just like back in the 1928 Germans voted predominately left-center, but due to foreign interference Germany couldn't form a left-center goverment. Then Nazi essentially tricked the masses with National-**Socialism,** then threw the socialist brownshirts under the train (night of the long knives) and gave a bunch of shit to 1% rich industrialist through privatization.\n\nAmericans wanted Bernie Sanders, but 1% doesn't want that. So Americans gets to chose between right and left offering two different flavours of social-chauvinism... socialism for the chosen. \"Left\" got some from dems, \n\nTrumps version is National-Socialism... a lot of billionaires and MAGA which are social-chauvinism riding together.\n\nWhat is going to happen, sorry, what is already happening? MAGA is getting thrown under the train. Egg price is not going down, promised tax breaks for middle class not included in the bill. Destroying Federal program will end up hirting red states the most, billionaires are also dismantling agencies which protected us from the billionaires... and Trump will either make US a fascist country.
