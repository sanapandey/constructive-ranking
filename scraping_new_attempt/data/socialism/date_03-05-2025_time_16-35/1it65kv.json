Those can be about socialism as a political movement, about shared struggles, or about anything else.\n\nAre you looking for a radical space for particular ideological traditions or geographical zones? Is there a subreddit you enjoy a that you would like to tell others about? Are you part of a subreddit that you would like to recommend others to join? Are you looking for a place for dog lovers but don't know where to search?\n\nPlease share it with us, and don't forget to check out our list of [related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/relatedsubreddits) as well as of [regional subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/regionalsubreddits)!\n\n*Please note: keep suggestions and discussion in positive character. This means not engaging in subreddit drama or negative attention. Do not post about reactionary spaces either: this is a socialist subreddit.*\n\nYours in solidarity, until the robots rebel.\n\n\\- Automod",
