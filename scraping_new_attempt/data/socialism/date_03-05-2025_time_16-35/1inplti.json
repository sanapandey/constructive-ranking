            "body": "I think it's obvious that the protests in Serbia are an attempted color revolution in the making, in the same vein as Georgia. This says little about Vu\u010di\u0107 himself, but liberal 'anti-corruption' movements in former socialist countries have always led to further regression without the coordination of communist parties. The 'revolutions' in the Eastern Bloc during the late '80s, like Solidarno\u015b\u0107 in Poland, are an obvious example of this. Another example is Ukraine in 2014, where Yanukovych, an otherwise unremarkable and opportunistic career politician, was violently overthrown by fascist thugs, escalating into civil war and now war with Russia, while Ukraine continues to be plundered for its resources\n\nThe room for progressive politics without Marxism has shrunken massively since the fall of the USSR and the turn of the century.",

This is definitely not a color revolution in the making and the movement itself has no leader and no support from the EU, which aligns itself with Vu\u010di\u0107 (who would happily give them our lithium at the expense of the environment and Serbian lives). It has no support from the US, either, with many American politicians happily calling for the \u201cviolent protests\u201d in Serbia to end (even though they\u2019re peaceful). \n\nVu\u010di\u0107 is a capitalist pig and deserves to go. \n\nThe students, who are the ones leading the protests and the movement itself, range from Marxists and communists to unhappy nationalists. I\u2019ve seen both and I\u2019m a student myself, but most are definitely left-aligned (in the European, *actual* left way, not the liberal American way).",

The PRL are basically a socdem party while the nkpj retain yugonostalgic elements. The biggest exception regarding the protests is the rnp-f, which takes the most skeptical position, pointing out how it\u2019s a mostly middle class protest with elements of neoliberal opportunism with classist and racist rhetoric expressed as well at some cases.",
