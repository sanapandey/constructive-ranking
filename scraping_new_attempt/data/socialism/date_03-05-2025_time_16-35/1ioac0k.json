In the country sides you'd see miners on strike shooting improvised rockets at police as the city centers were filled with anarchists and marxists who clashed with authorities. These trends grew. The decentralized nature caught authorities off guard, and the style of militant or mass civil disobedience spread to America in recent years after with occupy and anti police uprisings, each wave becoming more and more militant under obamas presidency. Parts of Europe even saw a rise in what they called \"left terror\" for first time since the Soviet union. Spain, Italy and Greece started seeing rapid growths in fascist propaganda during this time frame.\n\nVideo Sources:\n\n[uncut footage 1](https://youtu.be/9ICMOee25UM?si=f2bm5lziTdwfZr2f)\n\n[Media report](https://youtu.be/1Qmb2LNCPzM?si=2mtD7vHKGF1eflGS)\n\n\n[raw footage of the type of occurrences going down in city centers at the time](https://youtu.be/ieXrS3jvbUI?si=0goANSAY2anKSkXj)\n\n[a few years prior, in athens](https://youtu.be/Cdb3D-wJ3jg?si=-G47N36IboSyvwCm)\n\n\n\nThe fascists openly begin their reactionary propaganda campaign against agitators:\n\n\n[source 1](https://youtu.be/ZKyi2qNskJc?si=hpB4dw-c-KakDLbg)\n\n[source 2](https://youtu.be/45UfIEIU14w?si=gD7YUrGIEtyCIrO5)\n\n",

Fascism doesn\u2019t arise as a response to leftism, it arises as an effort to divert inarticulate workers who are agitated by the contradictions of capital ruining their lives away from the ruling class. It activates their yearning for revolution and repurposes it toward reinforcing the rule of capital. Leftist ideologies are made up of the people who can correctly identify the source of the problem .",

They saw that the organizing efforts of marxist and anarchist networks had more successful results in a climate where workers were discontent. So they began to utilize fascist propaganda in order to counter such efforts by funneling workers down a path that splinters from left leaning resistance movements. There's a reason Glenn beck had knowledge of their books.. bourgeois think tanks studied patterns of unrest in relation to leftist organizing. They based their reaction around these trends.",

They definitely were not occuring on the scale of militancy and anti-capitalism we could see among the Spanish miners, or within a Greek general strike. With that being said, these events inspired American organizers to step up their game. Occupy mostly fizzled out and were liberal, but in some regions and cities they were more anarchist and marxist backed. This includes the original movement in NYC.. it was organized by a popular front of marxists and anarchists looking to have mass appeal. These cities saw a revitilization of leftist organizing on the coming years. \n\nIn America we cannot forget about race. Obama's elections had racial reasons, and racist reactions. Obamas election also reflected people chasing a desire for change and something further to the left of the norm. Race and Healthcare, and anti war were the main topics of his first election. When it became exposed for what it was, a ruse, many uprisings occurred through the context of challenging white supremacy and the control of the racist police state. America's economy and racist system has created a very large lumpenproletariat, and labor reserve. The capitalist reaction to this, is expansion of policing and prisons. So modern class struggle in America, in its first appearances comes in the shape of a negation of policing and prisons.\n\n\nHere's the 2 most major occurrences of this that occurred during this period. Notice it wasnt long after trump began to become the law and order canidate, the one who said he would have the country \"sending these people out on stretchers again\". He activates the reactionary forces in response to these movements and struggles. This is by design of the bourgeois political think tanks and their contributors.\n\nLet me also make note that these are not isolated..the mid 2000s saw dozens of uprisings like this, which got more intense each time. Oakland after [Oscar Grant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Oscar_Grant) occurred in 2009. This was before occupy in 2011. This played apart in why occupy oakland was militantly opposed to police violence. The Ferguson uprisings were in 2014ish, Baltimore uprising was 2015. We got trump in 2015, as the figure head of this already existing reactionary strategy. In 2017 he won. After years of reactionary violence, the next incident of police violence led to an uprising more intense and widespread than any of the last - 2020 george floyd.\n \nTwo sources:\n\n[source 1](https://youtu.be/UBNRj1eRWLs?si=DxFjA6Tyd50h44Ns)\n\n[source 2 ](https://youtu.be/k5BG4CTrWAE?si=wW_tmv6B32ZcD-oH)\n\n\n\nThere's also been prison strikes in the usa, influenced by a branch of the iww organized by incarcerated anarchists and black revolutionaries. Some of the prisoners engaged in other acts of disobedience such as hunger strikes or riots.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_U.S._prison_strike\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_U.S._prison_strike",

Why do you think it is so difficult for mass worker movements in America to work? Because we are one of the most inundated and propagandized societies in the world.

In my opinion, I think that a good place for us to start is we focus on decentralized community support. We need to put in the work locally and detach our efforts from nation states, global financial markets, and even regional health care, fire services, police, and any other organizations that are funded from the top.",

Trump getting elected in 2016 led to a growth in leftist organizing and socialism re-entering the Overton window in America for the first time in decades.

If American economic hegemony was not under threat, this would not be happening. The capitalist class did not observe worker organizing in a medium and small European country and decide to hit the fascism button. 50 years of neoliberal hollowing out of the state has eroded institutional stability and social safety nets while wealth has continued to be concentrated and technology has enabled a massive increase in surveillance.

The capitalist class did observe leftist organizing in those countries, which is why bourgeois think tanks were following marxist groups, as well as anarchist propaganda and activity. Not only this but repressive policing agencies began to study the patterns of upheavel. Fascism isn't simply a button they press. Yes fascist think tanks began to be funded heavier in reaction to these occurrences. The places that had the earliest births of a powerful and emboldened European neo fascism were the same nations that security forces claimed a \"rise in left terror and agitation\" has been an issue. The fascist parties in greece,italy, and Spain almost laid a sort of blue print for the rest of europe in this time. \n\n\n\nNow America? THINK of the Obama years.\n Years of intensifying black insurrection never witnessed by the current era. It'd be ignorant to claim that these currents weren't of major concern for bourgeois interests. Trump literally got propped up as a populist figurehead to an undertone of a black uprising in Baltimore. \n\n\n\nI can't source everything because I just remember things I've read, so I'm going to paraphrase. A think tank, funded by conservatives and neo fascists said \"these forms of agitation were like a tumor, if thwarted and destroyed early can be weeded out of the public domain\".  I mean these policing agencies, and think tanks all have websites. Have for years. They started funding them when Americans demanded Healthcare and stops to war.. global protest movements and uprisings greatly upped the fascist propaganda because more elites began throwing money at neo fascist campaigns.\n\n\nThe nature of leftist agitation is based around getting reactionary forces to rear their heads, thus creating a defining line of sides in a conflict.. compelling people to pick one. This is why it seems \"the left\" grew under trump, but the reality is this phase of growth was already initiated before trump even announced his presidency run. People were just waiting for it to happen. People knew the reactionary motion would occur after their consistent actions. They wanted that to happen. It's not like the IRA made things easier for belfast residents. The entire idea was to force a reaction. This is a strategy, which is why people seemed so \"ready for a fight\" under his last presidency. It was a phase in development of struggle, designed that way by the agitators.\n\n\nThe mechanisms of control realized this strategy being successfully utilized, and then began their disinfo and cointelpro campaigns. Have you not witnessed the amount of propaganda being fed in every corner of media in response to all these anti policing uprisings? Bidens entire presidency... fox news, liberal media, and all internet algorithms and bots were constantly blaming everything on \"police morale\" being low. Every form of media we consume has been pushing this sentiment since 2021. They talk about black and or urban centers like they're beating a war drum against them. You couldnt go a day without hearing or reading sentiment that reflects white america feeling \"this anti police stuff has gone too far\". They definitely reacting to rebellions. The democratic party doesn't even know what to do with their increasingly radical young base, so they instead shun them and get behind fascism. White people feel attacked by class rebellion in America, and trump is a pure reaction to this. He's saying what they all quite honestly feel, even a majority of the dem white centrist voters.",

The militarization of police and their methods of surveillance can be traced back to the War on Terror and the Cold War before that. Before BLM, there were the Rodney King riots. Before Occupy, there were the WTO protests in Seattle. There was a fascist crackdown on those too, but the national political impact is larger now because the contradictions that produced those events have been heightened. I really don't get what you think you're saying here. \n\nI also don't think it makes any sense to compare the intent of a loosely organized, largely leaderless mass movement like BLM with the IRA. The point of agitation is to get people motivated to stand up for themselves and to fight for something. Inevitably that provokes a reaction because the opposing force is already there, or it wouldn't be a fight in the first place. It's not some brilliant strategic play. It's how class struggle works. It's like gravity. If you're just trying to get people to take sides, they might take the wrong side. The IRA also alienated a lot of people, and, as you might have noticed, they didn't achieve a united Ireland.",

Fascism as a movement does the opposite of that, or intends to. The left grows upon their own organizing terms, and their efforts have more results when the contradictions of capitalism are apparent through a \"crisis\".  \n\n\nI wouldn't exactly say the IRA alienated a lot of people. Much of Ireland's struggle for civil rights in the north, was born out of mass decentralized resistance. They were the vanguard of this preexisting motion. Did people not involved in the movement view mass hordes of radical youth clashing with security forces to an undertone of IRA gunmen/women as something that disrupted their peace? Yes. \n\n\nThis isn't my point. I'm just describing that these methods are long standing and of the same strategies. I'm not comparing the IRA to recent black rebellion, but the overall movement outside of the IRA in ireland did hold resemblance. The government knows and understands this strategy very well. Which is why they counter it. I can find you an article within seconds that will say \"anarchists/Radicals are using peaceful protestors as human shields\". This is how the state uses langauge in the media to counter these tactics. This is why despite the vast differences in intensity, you'll hear this same thing about the Gaza resistance. It's not that resistance movements want to make things \"less peaceful\" for the people, it's more so they want to create ruptures in the illusion of \"social peace\" under colonialism. The very nature of this will be disruptive to peoples daily lives.\n\n\nBTW I agree with everything you said. I don't agree that any of this is new to American life. Until the 90s, you couldnt even immigrate to America if you were found to be a communist or anarchist. In the 90s they removed this old immigration ammendment only because \"the threat was no longer significant\". Black people laugh at the notion that \"the us might create a murderous ethno state\". Might? They already built it in the 1700s!",
