Nobody is purely a good or bad person.\n\nChe held some pretty bigoted opinions in his youth, as was commonplace with most men of his generation in Argentina. But he spent most of his life fighting against racist regimes in the global south, and of course the Cuban Revolution. \n\nI would say Che had more good about him than bad for sure, there has been a concerted peopoganda effort to discredit him, so there is that. Near the end of his life he rescinded much of his racist attitudes, perhaps because he spent years working/fighting with black people in Africa.\n\nAn important thing to remember is that he existed in a time where racism, sexism, and homophobia were widespread thanks in part to the Catholic Church.",

They have no flaws or they have no qualities. History is more complex than that morality of calling people good or bad. \n\nChe was an upper middle-class Argentinian who traveled Latin America on a bike. By seeing the reality of those people in his travels, he got radicalized. He grabbed weapons and fought for the freedom of Cuba. Later, when he had a comfy job at Cuba's government, he grabbed weapons and abandoned his Cuban citizenship to fight Africa anticolonial struggles. After that, he went to fight in Latin America again and died.\n\nBut all of this was with great price. He barely saw his family for years. He lond of abandoned the family behind to fight for liberation of countries. He also divorced his first wife (this part I don't know much, but he might have cheated on her with his second wife). He also at his youth was a bit racist and homophobic. \n\nHe, in my opinion, is a hero, but he is a person first",

Analyze people's actions, what they said and what they did, and put those in the context of the conditions they found themselves in.\n\nTo answer your question, Che was an important revolutionary figure. His revolutionary acts were commendable, though adventurism is arguably what got him killed. As others have said, he had bigoted views, particularly when he was younger. The take away here is that his actions we would discard do not discredit those actions we would celebrate and vice versa. He did and said all the things he did and said. Our job is simply to use what's useful out of that and leave behind the rest.",

There was also ofc stuff that was sadly normal for the time but really bad like homophobia\n\nBut he was someone who passionately fought for a better world and had his heart in the right place. And helped overthrow the Batista dictatorship woth the Cuban revolution, which while flawed was a major improvement for Cuban workers and peasants.",
