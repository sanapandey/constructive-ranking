My understanding is pretty limited so I can't really help. \n\nEnglish language is best if possible. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

I was wanting to look into these ideas around the same age, I became disillusioned with the schooling systems and having already been put in the justice system, then coming out with probation until I was 15. Had curfews, ie I'm not in by 5pm I can be arrested again, so I had to just go from school to home, bad grades could get me in juvenile again, so it was a prospect that gave me a chip on my shoulder about the way society was set up. When I was 14 I almost went down an Alex Jones rabbithole, then a video of noam chomsky pulled me out because it made more sense, he brought me to Michael parenti. Not long after I learned about the black panther party which excited me the most.",
