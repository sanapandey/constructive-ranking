What id like to know is how do I talk to them without coming off as a douchey liberal? What points should I bring up? It seems like a lot of them recognize wealth inequality exists but don\u2019t know where to point that rage. I feel like this is a good time to reach out to people who have been down with trump but are starting to see just how fucking awful he is. I just don\u2019t even know where to start talking to these people. ",

And I just want to provide for my family the same way my parents did for me. And that we both served our country and work our asses off and it still feels like we can\u2019t get ahead. \n\nAnd then I just basically told him that in my honest opinion, everybody except Bernie sucks ass. And that I also hate democrats. And I explained that democrats also hate Bernie. And then I told him that if he\u2019s beginning to sour on trump, he could check out this Bernie sanders schtik on YouTube if he wanted. And I told him that when I soured on trump I felt left without a home and that Bernie\u2019s vision of the issues most accurately reflected my lived experience as a working class American. \n\nPeople hate on Bernie for Gaza. And I get that. But he\u2019s the one who got me into leftist politics and I feel like conservatives (like old me) really respect his consistency",

And once you establish that common ground, bring out up critiques of left viewpoint that founded on these values i.e hating economic inequality. Its a tough balance between getting them to question their viewpoint, without shaming them, as people respond badly to shame. Also remember, it usually takes a few conversations to shift people. Start off with just planting some seeds, people need time to mull things over, especially if they are deep in the Trump propaganda.",

Just keep re-enforcing that actual people are being harmed, your friends included, by the machinations of a couple of billionaires. You will have to try to tie it to a personal harm of theirs though because many conservatives have more insular views when it comes to compassion for others. \n\nBe honest, but try to find some common sense societal fears that many conservatives have & warn them about how we\u2019re going down that road. \u201cWe don\u2019t want US troops sent to wars or to spend money on foreign wars, but we\u2019re giving Israel money to do it to Gaza? We\u2019re antagonizing Canada our neighbors, Greenland, Panama? We\u2019re letting Russia (a long conservatism communist fear!) take 1/3 of Ukraine?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t do \u201cI told you so\u201d but identify with them & try to find some common aspect of what your conservative friend(s) feels conned by Trump. If you\u2019ve also fallen into a conservative (Neo-Fascist) grift previously, admit it, & try to re-enforce a narrative of Trump being \u201cthe coastal elite\u201d who conned them & is doing \u201cun-conservative\u201d things. A good recent argument is the Trump meme coin that was an obvious scam. \n\nJust keep pulling the little common sense threads, use logic & ethics, and just talk in plain terms: \u201cMan, it really sucks that our new POTUS hurt us with (blank), its like the elite & billionaires just hijacked & conned us\u201d or \u201chey you may like the guy, but I think what POTUS did was wrong because it hurts us like (blank) & it\u2019s like the guy who told us it would be different is punishing us? Guess you can\u2019t trust the billionaire class ever huh?\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t use emotion in your words or argument. It\u2019s true about 30% of our country has fallen into a cult & folie \u00e0 millions (mass delusion) and all the research says you don\u2019t break a cult member away with emotion.  Their emotional state is all tied up with the cult leader, & using that route will feel like your \u201cattacking\u201d that relationship & just \u201chating on Trump\u201d. It\u2019s the same concept with Scientology and their \u201csubversive person\u201d mentality. Remember they like Trump because \u201che tells it like it is\u201d or \u201che\u2019s a strong leader\u201d, \u201che\u2019s just joking & having fun\u201d, etc, are emotional ties to him. But use logic to show how those ties are not based in reality. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long & slow process, so take your time, they won\u2019t see it until they really feel hurt. Generally you have the best chance breaking away cult members when they see direct family (children) harmed, but not always.",

Correct them on things where you can without jumping down their throats. And most importantly leave them with questions to ponder themselves!! Good luck!
