    "selftext": "I had a Prof. at uni who was apart of WSWS. I didn\u2019t speak to this Prof. but they often times recruit lots of students to SEP/WSWS and their articles would be plastered all over campus. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of SEP/WSWS. It felt very culty and most were white men from well off backgrounds.\n\nIs it legit? To be clear I\u2019m not a Trot but I do like to uphold an orthodox sense of Marxism and at time I feel like they do that. Can ppl share their experiences? Thank you.",

            "body": "We have had a ban on WSWS link posts in this community for about a decade now. This is something that we only have applied to the ICFI organ. This was initially introduced on the eve of the so-called 'MeToo Movement', in which they ran multiple pieces engaging in outright rape apologia. Concurrent to other events where they also responded via rape apologia, and following requests from the community, [a ban was introduced](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1xc0sv/wswsorg_has_been_blacklisted/).\n\nI mention this because, far from having engaged in self-criticism over (or even moved away from) it, this has been a recurrent line, which shows its a structural problem. And as far as I know, the organisation itself is not that different either. Although its not something I'm particularly familiar with, nor that I can vouch for, questions of abuse coverup or heavy sectarianism have also been brought up.\n\nWith all due honestly, join any other organisation. Any of them will be better. Its not like its an organisation that does much actual organisation either, so it makes little sense to go through all those contradictions for nothing when you have many other Marxist organisations (Trotskyist and not so) with both more activity and more desirable lines/organisational structures.",
