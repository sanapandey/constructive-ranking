The thing is its both wrong in thought and form; we live in a materialist reality in which things are not always perfect, and this is a very basic point of Marxism, to think that socialism is wrong because it does not bring heaven to earth and bring about a utopian society right away, is wrong. The idea of Marxism, particularly socialism, is that first we must establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Right now some of you are shaking your heads, listen to this guy he wants to establish a dictatorship ignoring the fact we are already under a dictatorship, a dictatorship of the ultra wealthy who have the most control and influence over our current capitalist society. Marxism as an idea never pretended to be a doctrine or a religion , it is a science to which to examine capitalist society and through lenin to overcome it.",

                    "body": ">Proletarian dictatorship is similar to dictatorship of other classes in that it arises out of the need, as every other dictatorship does, to forcibly suppresses the resistance of the class that is losing its political sway. The fundamental distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and a dictatorship of the other classes \u2014 landlord dictatorship in the Middle Ages and bourgeois dictatorship in all civilized capitalist countries \u2014 consists in the fact that the dictatorship of landowners and bourgeoisie was a forcible suppression of the resistance offered by the vast majority of the population, namely, the working people. In contrast, proletarian dictatorship is a forcible suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, i.e., of an insignificant minority the population, the landlords and capitalists. \n\n> It follows that proletarian dictatorship must inevitably entail not only a change in the democratic forms and institutions, generally speaking, but precisely such change as provides an unparalleled extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy by those oppressed by capitalism\u2014the toiling classes. \n\n> [...] All this implies and presents to the toiling classes, i.e., the vast majority of the population, greater practical opportunities for enjoying democratic rights and liberties than ever existed before, even approximately, in the best and the most democratic bourgeois republics. \n    \nVladimir I.

Moreover, look at Cuba! There is very little poverty there, and everyone has a great education, healthcare, access to parks, and good recreation.\n\nIt's difficult speaking to people like this. \n\nI mentioned that the Soviet Union grew super fast, doubled their life expectancy, defeated fascism, and had very emancipated women.
