From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It jibes with a book I've read, called \"Against the Grain\", in which the author describes a death spiral of elite profit extraction.\u00a0\n\n\nThe \"shareholder class\" is essentially the nobility, expecting and demanding uninterrupted income streams. As they burn through the low-hanging fruits of profitability, they demand new revenue streams using resourced that are increasingly scarce and so provide at increasingly smaller margins of return.\u00a0\n\n\nAt some point, they start really squeezing the lower classes. The book's author claims that the nobles are so insulated as to be oblivious to peasant suffering. Maybe this is true of some of nobility, but the system selects for sociopaths and narcissists so that I believe they are indifferent or even happy to justify their cruelty\n\n\nIn the case of the shareholder class, they are largely insulated from the workers and the direct effects of their policies. They see layoffs and don't have to deal with the broken families, or else justify it's to themselves (Don't I deserve a return on my investment?)\u00a0",
