    "selftext": "Im a software developer and I was looking for a new project to sharpen up some skills and make something neat in the process. I love socialism but I was curious what a socialism economy would look like if you could simulate one. I have decided to make that simulation, and I was wondering if anyone could help me with resources or materials or even the knowledge itself required to make such a simulation, as Im not quite sure what it will entail or how it should be structured. It will be free and open source, and once I have enough information to get started, I will begin work and keep people updated here with the progress! Thanks in advance",
