Writers, artists, and in my case, photographers, are all petite-bourgeoisie, because \"they produce nothing but they exploit society's labor to live\"\n\nI felt a bit alienated by this definition and I was thinking about writing a speech on the topic for the next conference, does anyone have a good resource on this?",

A small business owner who has no employees, an artist, a writer, etc is not bourgeoisie. They own the means of their production (maybe) and are keeping the surplus for themselves, but there is nobody being exploited. A small business that is a co-op is not bourgeoisie because the workers are sharing the surplus labor among themselves and presumably decidind the course of the business through democratic means. A small business owner with five employees is petty bourgeoisie because they own the business and exploit the surplus of their employees labor.",
