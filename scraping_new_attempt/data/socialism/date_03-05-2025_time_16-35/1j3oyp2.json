You can argue morality until you're blue in the face, but some people believe it is good and noble and morally correct to extract labor value, rent, and so on.

You build enough parallel systems and eventually you become the system. Particularly, if you draw more people to your cause without radically disrupting their day to day lives or directly challenging the government. They say you can't work within the rules to change things, but you have to at least be willing to call their bluff before you rock the boat completely. Building momentum is critical, the right amount of pressure at the right time can make a real difference.\n\nBack to your question, I'd say the ethical dilemma is how you treat people that are part of your operation. Hypothetically I've always wondered, what if we sold our labor as a business?\n\nImagine a scenario wherein everybody sets up an LLC and will only work for a non socialist company as a B2B contract arrangement versus simply being a wage employee.",

Once you're ready to retire, first offer to sell your means of production at the cost that you still owe (for example property and you have an outstanding $50,000 mortgage), or donate if you fully own the means.\n\nI don't have a problem if you took a pay cut for the first few years and earn slightly more later on to recoup that. But once that is recouped then money should be shared equally as it was everyone's labor that got you there",

I've started a business in cannabis. We will be employee owned, with employees owning the second largest chunk of shares. That said, I had to give up 34% of the company to capital interests, which isn't terrible in the grand scheme of things but means at least that much surplus labor value is being stolen by definition. Now I fully intend to use profits over time to buy out those shares for employees, eventually netting non-executive employees 55% of the company making it technically fully employee owned and controlled (at which point I hope I've instilled enough class consciousness for employees to then buy out myself and my other main minority business partners).\n\nSo in the short term, no, my company isn't socialist. It's governed by socialist ideals, and we will be by far the most equitable company I'm aware of in my city, but there's absolutely surplus labor value being taken. In the long term though my goal is to have created and finished a project which employs capitalist strategies to transition the business to a truly socialist structure.",

            "body": "Yes. It may be an imperative. In our circumstance, you have two choices. Your labor will be exploited. Its surplus value will be stolen by an \"owner,\" a \"boss.\" Or, you can seize the means of production. A trade is a good way of doing this, but not the only way. Become a tradesman. Work for yourself. Keep the full value of your labor. Be transparent with your income and expenses, pay your workers fairly, and put them into a position to do the same when they are ready. The capitalist competes, the socialist cooperates. Unionize. Assist allied tradesmen in obtaining independence--when you're a plumber, but now the job requires a carpenter, ensure the carpenter is a comrade. Conglomerate these efforts into self-governing structures of mutual cooperation. Our goal isn't record breaking profits for shareholders year after year--infinite growth in a finite system, aka cancer--our goal is independence from exploitation. Capital only matters when there's scarcity. We must obtain the means of controlling and addressing scarcity to the greatest degree. Until we do this in a concerted way, the benefits of our knowledge, skill, and effort will accrue only to the landlords.",

Ugh the bar is so low in the capitalist society. \n\nI've thought about this plenty, and I've decided that if I ever own a business, I want the same profit as the person employed to do housekeeping in the office. If people employed by me cannot make ends meet, I shouldn't be better off just because I \"own\" the business. Everyone who has a stake in the means of production should reap all the benefits. \n\nWith that being said, would I look down on a socialist who owns a business and makes the most profit in their company? No, because we live in an unfortunate reality where capitalism is a present fact of life and profit doesn't always equal bad (mainly because I never know what someone may need that profit for, they may be supporting sick family or something). I can't really say what is and isn't acceptable, but it's a matter of conscience for me...I am just wired this way. I'm an anarchist, so I also fully believe that other people's actions are far less important than the consequences, so looking at someone make a little more profit as the CEO of a small company is fine by me...where it starts to become annoying is where there is a massive hoarding of wealth and resources sitting in banks. Both are the same action of profiteering, but the consequences are far more severe for everyone else with the latter. \n\nI guess it boils down to moderation too...a business should be successful, but does it require a national monopoly for you to feel successful? Probably not, so just go for it I guess \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc",

            "body": "Depends. Do you allow workers, once a part of the company, to have direct ownership. Not through buying in, but getting garraunteed ownership and power through labor and performing duties as an 'employee'? That's what I think of when I think of the basics of a socialist society, everyone owns a piece of the pie they help bake, and everyone works to feed everyone else with the surplus. \n\nIf you want socialism to work in a modern setting, think of it as having every single person in a business, all having an exact, equal amount of power in rhe company no matter where they sit on the 'totem pole' of production. No ceos with 78 percent of the companies shares doing absolutely nothing of value and still siezing the means of production, no monopolistic organizations like Blackstone having monopolistic control over the working class as a whole. \n\nIn all reality, capitalism isn't about selling the product, it's about selling the worker, how little can the company give the worker to get them to work. Socialism is about ensuring the truest form of equality for all while still allowing reach through limited private equity. \n\nI'm only 21, so if I got stuff wrong here, feel free to correct below, and thanks in advance.",

Kropotkin was a prince.\n\nMoreover, Lenin directly advocated for Communists to create \"local economic strong points\", giving examples of small business types of his time. https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/reorg/ii.htm\n\nBeing bourgeois or proletariat is irrelevant as a Communist because Communists' job is to interface with and organize the *masses*. In fact, presuming no ulterior motives, it would be a great boon for business owners and others with wealth to back Communists since that would provide the necessary funds to do party work and mobilization. It's not the 1900s where the Bolsheviks could rely on bank robberies to acquire funds.\n\nNot only is there no moral qualm (unless you're a shitty person who abuses their employees), it's even *preferable* for Communists to have businesses owners in their numbers.",
