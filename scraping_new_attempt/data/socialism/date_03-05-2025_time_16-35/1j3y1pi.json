    "selftext": "I have such a proposal. \nThere have been many different discussions about the Russian-Ukrainian war here for a very long time.\nI am a Russian communist, and it so happened that I am the head of the territorial branch of the CPRF (comrades, understand, not everything is bad in the grassroots organizations of the CPRF).\n\nIn general, for a more thorough and scientific discussion, I can present the view of the Russian bourgeoisie and government on this war. I have studied and delved into all the intrigues and plans of the Russian government for 3 years, and I think I am ready to present the arguments of the Russian bourgeoisie why the war began.\n\nThe question is: is such a position needed here and is it interesting for you to discuss it?",
