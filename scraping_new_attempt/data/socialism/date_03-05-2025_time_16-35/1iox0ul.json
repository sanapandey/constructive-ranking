    "selftext": "\n(Hello, made a similar post in another community but figured I could reach more people for insight on this page as well)\n I'm hoping the community can give me some advice on how to help a younger member of my family. They are active on social media so l'll keep this vague for privacy. \n\nTo start this is a really smart kid, they are obsessed with philosophy, history (specifically WW2) and will read all day if you let them. There is nothing wrong with knowing you're smart, but teenager confidence leads them to believe they are the smartest person in the room and that causes them to speak about philosophers and politics in a condescending armchair intellectual kind of way. We live in the DEEP south so a lot of his obscure pseudo intellectual talking points go over the family's head and they miss the dog whistles l've been hearing out of this kids mouth.\n\nFor a while now they have been talking about how much they\n'admire' the Nazi's strategies and tactics. Seeing the writing on the wall l've asked them to give me recommendations on YouTube channels they watch. Two of them being ShoeOnHead and WhatifAlhist. I'm not an expert on these YouTubers but from what l've seen they add more to my anxiety about the direction this kid is going in.\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to help direct their passion for learning towards anti-nazi sentiment and more progressive ideas l'd be very grateful. This is a good kid with a lot of strengths and kindness and I don't want to see it corroded by hateful rhetoric.",

Haven\u2019t followed her in a while but last I saw she was pivoting more to \u201cmale loneliness epidemic\u201d discussions which I guess isn\u2019t inherently bad but seems to be taking some sort of centrist positions. I think good entry points are Hasan and secular talk. Both have a pretty bro persona so they are palatable to young men I think. Second thought it pretty good and informative and engaging. Sam seder is also a good entry point. \n\nThose are just some media sources you can nudge them in the direction in. As for social engagement I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019ve got young family members that are also flirting with maga and Andrew Tate shit. I think you should start by asking them earnestly and asking what attracts to them these ideologies. I think if you take a militant approach people are naturally defensive when confronted so that might cause them to stray further away. Have an honest conversation with them.\n\nMost important is that you need to be persistent and offer them an off ramp. Personal ly I think a lot of young men stray to the alt right because they are offering them a safety line. Lib scolds don\u2019t offer anything to boys and young men, they just tell them they are bad and need to listen to women and POC. Whose perspectives are importantly, but as we know people like Clinton and Harris are not representsatives of the left . Daily wire , Joe Rogan, Andrew tate, Elon are more than happy to gain new followers. People need to be rehabilitated not abandoned.",

            "body": "Teenagers can be stubborn. You may want to inquire about the topics that specifically interest them and follow the thread. If the topic is related to a positive view of the Nazis, sincerely ask the for their source so you can learn more.\n\nThe first step will be to verify their sources. Are they relying on peer reviewed scholarly works? Perhaps the text they cite is written by a scholar, but they are not an expert in that specific field (this happens very frequently). Problems can arise if they are unable to differentiate credible sources with dubious ones. For example, if they rely primarily on polemic sources, especially from private publishers or even worse, YouTube videos, then they will have a very malformed understanding of History.\n\nAs you investigate topics, you will become familiar with the experts in the field. On the topic of Nazi Germany, you will often see authors like Tooze, Weinberg, Kershaw cited, among others. Perhaps you can guide them towards the path of academic investigation into the topic of Nazi Germany, if they are so interested. \n\nHowever, if their interests lay beyond intellectualism and reliable information and instead appear to take more interest in rationalizing Fascist talking points, then I'm afraid I have no answers for you. Mussolini and Hitler's writing feel painfully divorced from reality, so I personally don't have the skills to sway someone who already sympathizes with Fascism away from that path.\n\nAs you discuss these topics, listen for anything that sounds less than credible. Ask them for a source. Verify it, and if needed, confront them on the conflicting source you've found. Personally, I don't carry much optimism for those who idealize Fascism, but I wish you the best of luck.",

            "body": "If they like philosophy, are ok with podcasts rather than videos, and aren't allergic to overtly socialist content, RevLeftRadio has plenty of philosophy centric episodes and are always principled socialists in their analysis. There are also history focused episodes, especially on some of the sister podcasts like Guerrilla History and Red Menace. \n\nTeenagers can definitely be full of themselves and can definitely gain an over-inflated sense of self from relatively minor appearances of superiority to others. Other than alternative sources of information, I would highly recommend helping them to find socially-positive actions to channel their philosophy and history interests into. More than ever, our society is one of consumption, to the point that knowledge itself is commodified and used only as a parlor trick to make one seem smarter than other people instead of used to improve one's society. This can exacerbate the normal illusions of grandeur that teenagers in particular can have. Giving them involved in a practical activity that involves having many people share achievement can at least ground this behavior in something material (ie. I'd think it much healthier for a teenager to be bragging about improving a small corner of their community than being able to rattlle off Kant's categorical imperative).",
