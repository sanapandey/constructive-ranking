            "body": "Greece is wild. In 2008 when cops shot an anarchist teen, they mobilized thousands of militants within a one hour period. They didn't even post for protests, people just circulated word of mouth and sent out emergency texts and people were ready. I believe this being the largest strike in their history is a result of of all the past efforts and struggles people engaged in. The Greek 2008 riots were so significant that American reactionaries were freaking out about it. Glenn beck had a whole episode yelling that \"if anarchists and communists act like that here America is doomed my friends\".",

The government didn't take accountability even though the minister of transportation was well aware of the lack of safety and had talked about that not being an issue in the parliament a few days before the accident. Our government tried to blame the conductor and cover up the rest so they didn't look bad.",
