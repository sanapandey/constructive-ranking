            "body": "I think any party in Europe that wants to reform the EU has no potential. MERA 25 wants to federalise the union which is a hard no for communists.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by 'realistic.' If you want to be a careerist politician, Die Linke or the SPD are the better choices. If you want to enact truly radical changes and advance the struggle to bring Germany closer to communism, then participation in the Bundestag is not that important, nor is having a large number of party members, which also isn't crucial at this stage of the struggle. What matters is having the correct theory, something comprehension in Marxism-Leninism will provide, and being able to identify where the revolutionary subject in Germany is. This is especially important as it is a wealthy imperialist nation where much of the population has a petty-bourgeois consciousness. That is politics, and good politics will always create results. Even if refusing to engage in opportunism or compromise on key principles means a smaller membership at first, there will be opportunities to grow if a revolutionary nucleus exists",

                    "body": "I spent a few days with them around the election. They were mostly liberals teetering on the edge of disillusionment. They were not all Marxists or ML's (although many were), and one of them unironically quoted the \"saving capitalism from itself\" line from Varoufakis. Some were actually surprised to find out YF was a socialist. But by God, they were some of the most well intentioned human beings I have ever met on this planet!\n\nIt sounds too simplistic to wait for the \"revolutionary nucleus\" to grow. Such a nucleus doesn't exist in the party, but does in the blue collar East, and is being exploited by reactionary elements in the country, in the absence of a \"real\" leftist party, with the exception of BSW (shame they didn't make the cut). By \"real\", and \"realistic\", I meant a party that doesn't just do lip service to the interests of the working class, but actually represents them, and is not neutered beyond repair, like the MLPD.\n\nI am not a strong believer in electoral politics either. But it felt more \"productive\" to go out and do something *with* people, rather than endlessly argue with State Dept, or Hasbara bots on reddit\n\nPS: I never quite understood the problem with federalism. The USSR was a federation of Soviets, after all. As a socialist, I prefer cooperation over isolation",
