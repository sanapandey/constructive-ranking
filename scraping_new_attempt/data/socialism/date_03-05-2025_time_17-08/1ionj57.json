    "selftext": "In my country, there are no genuine socialist parties. The only one that exists is deeply corrupt and has tarnished the name of socialism by failing to deliver on its promises. As a result, many people have lost faith in socialism altogether.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to find any better parties or organizations that align with my values\u2014or at least, they\u2019re not visible or accessible to me. \n\nI\u2019m considering starting a new movement or party, but I\u2019m not sure where to begin. Right now, I have a Discord server with around 30 Marxist-Leninists from my country, but I know that online discussions alone don\u2019t count as real praxis. \n\nHow would you recommend I take the first steps toward building something meaningful?",

            "body": "It's a big issue, I would say that there is no single answer and it depends a lot on the conditions of your country/city and also on your own: if you are a student its different to if youre a worker, and it also influences whether you actively participate in some mass organization or not (union, neighborhood, etc.).\n\nPerhaps the first warning I would give you is that its not necessary to rush things. A party is not decreed, its the result of a process, so I would recommend trying to form an organization that can begin three specific tasks:\n\n-Start a specific work in some mass space, in order to immediately link up with the class struggle in its concrete form and for the organization to be forged from there.\n\n-Advance slowly but surely in its theoretical/ideological elaboration. I would not dwell so much on labels but rather on categories that are useful depending on the first task. There must be a relationship between both levels.\n\n-Finally, work on training militants and those who join us, together with a permanent, albeit humble, propaganda work.\n\n30 people is not a small number, but it is important that they can put together some concrete common work.",

From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
