    "selftext": "Curious about a topic I\u2019ve been interested in lately. Me and my wife were just discussing critical pedagogy and youth programs and it got my brain thinking:\n\nAre there any examples of leftist scouts? And if not, what would one of these groups look and function like? For context, I\u2019m more so talking about US scouting and I don\u2019t mean youth paramilitary groups. I\u2019ve never been a member of one of these scouting groups.\n\nBSA seems to be a good organization but it appears its end goals are to train young people in military culture, propagandizing American values and having a reverence for Christian identity in these orgs and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in signing my (future) kids up to if that\u2019s the primary motive of the overall national organization. \n\nI\u2019m interested in how a leftist interpretation of these groups would look like, especially if it\u2019s focused on improving the lives of the kids who join by teaching them important life skills for free. \n\nLet me know, thanks :)\n\n",

With the Komsomol or Young Communists for older kids and young adults.\n\nI also get what you mean, I was in Scouts in Australia for almost all of my youth, and the nationalism and insistence on belief in some form of higher power doesn't sit well with me, espescially in a settler colony.",
