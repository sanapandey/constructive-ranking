I'm looking for books specifically about unionization and organizing. More particularly, methods anti-fascist groups used to successfully dismantle dictatorships historically. I appreciate all the other suggestions though as well and will keep them in mind",

We are living under late-stage capitalism under Biden and under tr-mp. Neoliberals live under the illusion that basically everything is fine as long as a republican isn\u2019t in office and then flip out every four years, most recently at the prospect of tr-mp, and that is the most infuriating thing for me, because everything is far from fine - things have always been very bad here and they were reaching a boiling point under Biden too. \n\nIf you\u2019re just now coming to the conclusion that we are living under fascism, I encourage you to reflect on the privilege / basically how sheltered you might be in order to live under that false pretense and consider why you haven\u2019t thought about it until now, even while the previous administration jumped the gun on basically announcing the pandemic \u201cwas over\u201d (it never ended) and then funded a genocide.",

I've kept up with all of this ever since the start and have protested in every way I can. I've consistently boycotted israel from October 7th to now, I've signed petitions, been apart of strikes & have campaigned for several families as well because no, I will not be complicit in genocide.\n\nI too know that the pandemic never truly ended. My grandmother was one of the many who suffered long covid (in fact she almost lost her life to it) & I have younger siblings who got hit with covid earlier this year. That's why to this day I keep my distance in public, I try to keep things like hand sanitizer or tissues with me and I'm always vaxxed\n\nI'd like to note ; aside from being Ojibwe (because I'm aware somebody can be native/a person of color and still be oblivious) I'm also 2S, queer, autistic, hindu and have several physical disabilities so yeah, this whole oppression thing isn't a new concept to me at all.",

And then if you want to get into, for instance, Spain, that's a whole other can of worms.",

The unionization and community organizing is where I fall flat so I'm more looking for books on how people came together to successfully abolish fascist systems historically.
