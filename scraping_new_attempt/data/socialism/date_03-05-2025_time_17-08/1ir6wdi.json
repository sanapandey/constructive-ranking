We all know how the trump nazis will react, so that won't be a surprise.\n\nhilariously, it will be the Dems who will (maliciously) oppose any socialist entering the race as an independent- especially if he/she gets enough grassroots funding (a big hurdle tbh) to be considered a serious contender. We'll hear stuff like \"he's playing spoiler for the republicans, etc\" - meanwhile all the Dems will do is vote for wage-slavery-lite laws and tell the working class to eat their shit sandwich and like it too...",

Beyond that is the fact that there's not, to my knowledge, a mass effort to make a strong case for socialism to anyone not currently interested.\n\nAnd a socialist president is nothing without sufficient support from the legislative branch and the larger populace.",

It won't be overly secterian, anyone from marxist leninist to anarchist to demsoc is welcome. As long as anti capitalist. National, but decentralized and based on local chapters. Democratic decision making, with mediators from each union. Name? RWOC. Revolutionary Workers Organizing Committee. It will start with preexisting union members, and be openly promoted with the purpose to offer as a formal Organizing base for existing labor unions to unify efforts. This would be a break from the DNC as the base of bringing the unions together for political action. Anyone in a union down for this in theory, should consider the logistics of such a plan.",
