    "selftext": "Left-wing political/protest music used to be very mainstream in the \u201860s and \u201870s during the era of the Vietnam War. \u201cFortunate Son\u201d by Creedence Clearwater Revival immediately springs to mind. But these tackle a fundamentally leftist theme: anti-war which is anti-imperialist. Or even later in the \u201870s in the UK you have The Sex Pistols make \u201cGod Save The Queen.\u201d A thorough critique of monarchy and authority. And in the \u201880s protest music goes more underground with great acts like the Dead Kennedys but still relatively mainstream. But they had anti capitalist songs satirizing the bourgeoisie like \u201cKill the Poor\u201d and songs just straight up saying stuff like \u201cLet\u2019s Lynch the Landlord.\u201d Giving Mao energy. But the biggest protest song of the \u201880s \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d is still misinterpreted as a patriotic song. And I think the reason that we have no more political music from an anti-war and (especially not an anti-capitalist) perspective in the mainstream is Ronald Reagan (aka The Devil if you\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d). Ever since we elected Ronald Reagan he has never left office really. His economic policies are still in place. Reaganomics is upheld by the Democratic and Republican parties. That\u2019s the inevitable result of reformist ideologies like social liberalism or social democracy. Reform is undone. That is why socialism is needed. But yeah that is why Chappell Roan will support Palestine but not make a song about it. She isn\u2019t allowed to. And you even see conservative music on the charts instead. Mostly because conservatives game the system. But also conservatism doesn\u2019t challenge capitalism. It\u2019s all about capitalism.",

Capitalists are very happy to sell you socialism. They\u2019ll sell you t-shirts of Che, Soviet flags, and leftist music no problem. Hell they\u2019ll sell you the guillotine you use on them while selling you a warranty for it. What I would say is that post 911 in the terror era of Bush that there was the sharp pro right gamification. I would say this combined with the loss of momentum that believing in liberal candidates like Obama and Trudeau would put an end to conservative madness. This loss of momentum occurred during the early stages of the development of the algorithm which in turn was fed and was fed by the rising fascist tide. Of course once the worst of the worst of the oligarchs got control of these systems, it was nothing to resume the gamification anew and more aggressive than ever.",

Punk got imitated and commodified, so it was in the public conscious. It also impacted the legitimate non commercial music of the 90s as well, like all of the original grunge and emo scenes. Music still wasn't fully made safe for capitalism yet, so you still had a lot of the energy from the punk subculture impacting musical movements. \n\nPunk music on the other hand has become more political with time. It always had certain political undertones but by the 90s it began to basically develop into angry left resistance music. Underground punk bands of this era into the early 2000s, have albums and eps straight up named \"anti imperialist\". The influence of two political currents that occured within the realm of punk was the working class skinhead, and anarcho punk. The Song \"I get knocked down, but I get up again\" was written by an anarcho punk band who made a joke pop song and got bank off of it. They contributed to good causes, funny story. These genres of punk gained more popularity in the 90s and influenced the political direction of punk into the future. \n\n\nHere's the song I was referring to vs music they usually made\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2H5uWRjFsGc\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kWLHpuLrpyk",

The other indication of fascist music is the formula that is used for for pop music. I can hardly tell one pop song from the other. Movies and music are unwilling to take financial risks.

It touches on many relatable subjects - depression, alcoholism and drug abuse as a coping mechanism, impacts of social media on our self-worth, feelings of helplessness due to ineffectual political leaders, and more. I recommend watching the music video. It has amazing symbolism. It shows her performing heartwrenching moments of her life to an audience who laughs and eats popcorn. \n\nAurora is another great one. Her song \"The Seed\" has the main chorus: \"When the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poisoned, you can not eat money.\" She is one of my favorite artists right now. The song \"My Body's Not Mine\" from her new album is dedicated to Palestine.",
