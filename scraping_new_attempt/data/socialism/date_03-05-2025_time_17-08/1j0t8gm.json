Now is a good time to be an activist too.\n\n\nThere might be a People's Forum in your city where you can learn about socialist causes and protests. You can work with local Pro-Palestine and anti-war groups.\u00a0 Any time there is a protest, find out who organized it.\n\n\nYou can also support / donate to independent and non-profit left-wing news outlets and podcasts. Alot of American news (both MSNBC and Fox) are owned by investors who also have significant financial interests in weapon manufacturering companies like Lockheed. We need alternative voices really badly.\n\n\nThank you for asking. Good luck and stay safe!",
