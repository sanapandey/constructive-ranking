(On a side note: Its really sad to see that germans who follow judaism still have to take huge measures to protect themselves from such attacks)\n\nAnd last year our parliament voted on a Resolution to combat antisemetism in germany. But heres the kicker: The Halle Attack is not even mentioned in the document. Instead it talks abour antisemetism as a mostly imported problem and even has the audacity of naming an Israeli filmmaker as an example for antisemetic sentiments, because he made a Statement against Netanyahu on a film festival.\n\nMeanwhile the Halle Attacker was a white german neo nazi.\n\nThey completely externalized Antisemitism to the \"foreigners\", muslims and anti imperialist leftist and its driving me nuts.",

I also find that they don\u2019t really care all that much about race issues, otherwise they\u2019d actually oppose imperialism. Liberals somehow try to walk this line where they pretend to care about race issues while also condemning black political movements of the past, unless they\u2019ve been whitewashed properly.\n\nAlso I refer to the culture war not in terms of WHAT issues we\u2019re talking about, but rather HOW they\u2019re interacted with. I would argue climate change has become a culture war issue. Culture war issues are divisive issues where the way the masses interact with them are primarily through the vehicle of consumption, there is a clear Republican and Democratic side to the issue, and everyone fights over individual consumption patterns instead of the underlying politics.\n\nFor example, in lieu of real climate policy, we argue over consumption patterns:\nThe conservatives don\u2019t care and buy big pickup trucks\nThe liberals do care so they purchase electric vehicles and solar panels on their roofs.\n\nNeither of these things actually helps solve the issue on the scale that it must be solved, but there is vicious debate around these consumption patterns regardless. This is a culture war issue. I don\u2019t call issues \u2018culture war\u2019 issues because they\u2019re unimportant, I call them that because of how the masses engage.\n\nNow, onto my comment about the liberal side of the culture war. We are socialists (or at least I\u2019m assuming you are). Our job is not to tie ourselves to gross western chauvinists, our job is to unite the proletariat and pull them into the political realm ON THEIR OWN TERMS. This means the proletariat doesn\u2019t bicker amongst itself about individual consumption patterns, but rather engages in politics without being chained to one of the capitalist parties.",

His impact has further advanced Marxism in theory, both in the academy and in the streets.\n\nYou \u201chating\u201d Lenin shows me that you\u2019re not serious about organizing.
