    "selftext": "Speaking with many liberals will make you realize how infantile their thinking is. \n\n\"We are better than this\"\n\"NATO is supposed to be the good guys\"\n\"Elon Musk needs to be stopped\"\n\nIt's almost as if this \"NATO\" thing was created by the US and since Europe no longer interests America it's dismantling it or reorganizing it however it wants. NATO always serves US interests after all.\n\nThe liberal propaganda of \"the good guys defending democracy\" was never real. There is no good or bad. There's only class interests.\n\nRight now Ukraine's resources are a more profitable venture for capitalist class interests instead of continuing the war. Ask yourself why the US extended this war when it could easily end it?\n\nExtracting rare earth minerals will be crucial for US capitalists who are finding a hard time competing with China. Elon specifically needs Ukraines resources because he is feeling pressured by Chinese competition \n\nLiberals do not understand this and are focused on \"good guys vs bad guys narrative\"\n\nEdit: btw liberals, you may think you have a \"democracy\" in your country but that will be easily dismantled by capitalists. They have perfected destroying \"democracy\" all over the global south for the past 75 years ",

That's how you end up with countries where people can die if they cant pay for healthcare that are still called 'free democracies' or 'best places to be'.\n\nLiberals are just rehashed, modern face of the 18th century aristocracy and their bourgeois surrogates, posing behind a facade of humanism, of which they don't even apply an ounce. That is why they support any war that 'their side' starts or supports. And that is why a country is 'free and democratic' as long as their own privileges and wealth are not touched, even if the rest of the country is on fire.",

Most resources that are located at government-controlled territories are crucial for basic  population's survival. \n\nFor example, natural gas that is extracted in Ukraine can hardly provide gas to all households with gas stoves - and even this almost full coverage of population's demand became possible after massive deindustrialization. Axing population's access to natural gas will mean deaths from starvation in large cities, where most people live in khruschevkas. \n\nThat is also fair for coal mines that are currently controlled by Ukraine. They cannot be used for profiting at the external markets; Ukrainian coal can be used now only for centralised heating. And heating is crucial for the territory with long lasting frosts (heating season in Ukraine lasts from October till April).\n\nUkraine is not Colorado. It's a great and cruel lie, aimed at colonising the land and enslaving the workforce. Ukrainians have nothing left to sell - only themselves.",

The Ukrainian bourgeosie sold their souls to the devil and the Ukrainian(and Russian) proletariat are paying with their lives. The sooner you understand the interests at play do *NOT* consider human well-being as something to be taken into account the sooner you can move on to the actual substance of the problem.\n\n> We could easily do something?

What's good for the rich isn't good for us. What's good for the west isn't good for non-western aligned people. \"Good\" is entirely subjective and depends on who's perspective you're looking at and, therefore, entirely irrelevant in any analysis. Class interest is universal, a worker in Russia or Africa wants the same things you do. Class struggle provides an absolute and objective analysis based on material conditions. They experience the same contradictions and exploitation you do. Scale depends, of course, but the basic class conflict is universal across the capitalist world. \n\nThe rich need to go. Whether they are American, Ukrainian, Chinese or whatever. Race is irrelevant. Class is everything.",
