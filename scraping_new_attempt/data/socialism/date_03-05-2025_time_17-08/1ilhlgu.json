    "selftext": "I live in the US and it\u2019s very hard to find leftists because most people here just know republican vs democrat and think those are the only two options. I live in Florida and most of my friends are liberals I guess (but none are zionists). I have a friend in California and she is the one who aligns with me the most politically.\n\nA lot of people where I live think its intellectually superior to just describe themselves as a moderate because they dislike both parties and think that being a moderate/apolitical is the only way to escape the two party system. They\u2019re not really aware that the political spectrum of the US is mostly right leaning, even liberals. \n\nI met my boyfriend (21M) last year and I thought he was a lot more left leaning than he actually is because he is agnostic/atheist, said that if he could vote in the 2020 and 2016 elections he would have voted blue but for last year he was unsure because he thought that both parties were both terrible. At the time I assumed he meant that because both parties were zionists, but now I\u2019m not really sure what he meant. He also watches Hasan sometimes (who I don\u2019t really watch anymore but I agree with a lot of his views on current topics) so I thought he was left leaning. \n\nIt turns out he doesn\u2019t like either party and describes himself as a moderate, but I really think that\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t realize that other options exist. I don\u2019t even think he really understands what I believe politically because it seems like he thinks people can only be republican, democrat, or moderate. He also didn\u2019t vote last year. I was thinking of showing him youtube videos by second thought because that\u2019s what helped me become more left leaning but I\u2019m really unsure. \n\nWhat have you guys done in the past to show less political people your perspective?

Most people here in my country have a very narrow understanding of what constitutes as \"left\" and \"right\", so, to many, socialism is this whole new thing they've never considered. People all over the world nowadays are eagerly looking for more radical ideas.",

I stumbled upon and was introduced to politically charged music, I liked watching cult classic movies that often offered critiques of current society or aspects of it, I read books that were and are suggested for book bans and eventually read more sociological or political issue books.\n\nI think one of the best ways is to have conversations and relate to other people. We're all experiencing mostly the same struggles. You can talk about workplace conditions, housing issues, healthcare, food access, every working class person struggles with these to some degree.\n\nIn addition to the conversations you can suggest media that relates like the book Nickeled and Dimed about low wage jobs, or movies like The Corporation about modern corporations, Harlan County USA about a strike, or Incident at Oglala about US justice system and indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Of course what you suggest depends on the political mind of your person.

And when I say disruptive event, I am referring to shaking someone to the core. Like a fundamental sort of moment. I believe most internet denizens would refer to it as a 'Canon event.' I'll speak for primarily Americans, but I think politics are heavily ingrained into people before they even realize what's going on. My father and brothers essentially beat it into my soul, that we were conservative family and should remain as such, until I left home. So the idea of shaking of beliefs that'd been held near and dear for decades was difficult. The average person isn't really willing to consider that beliefs they've held onto for so long, could be wrong. Maybe I'm just being a cynic, but converting people helps if they're younger or haven't necessarily been political before.\n\nHowever, I would say don't go into a conversation trying to 'convert' or bring them over to your side. Go in with the idea of simply laying out the information as simply and digestible as possible.   \n  \nTry to have passion, but not being emotional about the topics, no matter how close they are to your heart. On the subject of emotions/proximity, try to approach the situation via subjects close to the person's heart. If they are heavily Christian, learn some scripture that helps your point. If they care about children, then learn policies from different political spectrums that help reinforce your point. \n\nTry showing the logical fallacies/tactics that mainstream media likes to use in order peel back the curtain. [https://www.youtube.com/@InnuendoStudios](https://www.youtube.com/@InnuendoStudios) makes YouTube videos that break down the Alt-right playbook.\n\nTry to frame things not as them being 'wrong' necessarily, but as being misguided.\n\nLearn common comebacks or retorts that others try to use in order so that you aren't caught off guard when someone has an actual response that isn't a logical fallacy. \n\nKnow your target, if they don't care about statistics and theory, then meet them with praxis. \n\nStart slow and stay optimistic. And a small saying I keep in my back pocket to help keep me motivated is, ' If it was easy, then someone would have done it for me.' Much love and stay strong.",
