If I had to nitpick two issues with both the ML and anarchist sides of the left, the anarchist issue would be people on the edge of the movement get addicted to the act of \"direct\" action and \"resistance\" while leaving others to organize on their own, leading to predictable actions and burnout. The ML issue is the idealogical ghettos can become cultish, which leads to isolation and drives people away. \n\nI don't believe these are dominant issues, it's just issues I noticed that tend to exist on both spectrums of the left. This is why I tend to meet people based upon how they understand praxis in relation to theory rather than \"I'm this flavor of communism so only work with people of this flavor\". We are in the class struggle, not fighting for stocks in the market place of ideas.",

It's based on the Bolshevik model, a dues paying party, and yeah they sell a party newspaper and communist literature, but that pays for the party's operations, be that our printing company or upkeep at the RCI Headquarters in London, as we are just the American Branch of an internationalist party with several thousand members in countries across the world. Expenditures by the party are audited by volunteer committees democratically chosen during the yearly party congress to make sure nobody is misappropriating party funds for self enrichment. \n\nI pay dues, but I've been told by literally every member I've spoken with, including the head of party operations in my region, *not* to pay anything more than I feel comfortable with paying, cuz they're a party for the working class first and foremost, they're not trying to wring people dry or make them feel like they're getting fleeced. You're asked to help sell the newspaper and purchase the party literature, but there's no quotas to meet or pressure to do it. Plus the whole \"oh it's an MLM\" argument falls apart more when you look at it deeper because the party as a whole only has a few actual wage-earning, fully employed-by-the-party members who mostly deal with logistics and focusing discussion topics for party cell meetings. The rest is volunteer work by passionate comrades. I was also really skeptical of them at first, because *yeah* on the outside it looks kinda MLM-ish, but I think the party means well, and our members have the best interests of our comrades at heart. They've been doing really cool stuff too, the Pakistan branch has been exploding and getting active lately, and the other week, our comrades in the Canadian branch ( ironically, their party is called the RCP) held a marxist literature school in Montreal that drew 600 attendants, all there to learn about communist theory. There's another one set to be held in Atlanta next sunday, and I'm excited to go and meet some other members from the Southeast and learn with em.\n\nI'm not trying to sell the party to you or change your mind, congrats if you read this far, you can think what you wanna think, I just wanted to give my 2 cents as somebody who joined and is proud of their comrades.",
