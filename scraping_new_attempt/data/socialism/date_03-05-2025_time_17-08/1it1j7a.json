I\u2019ve started reading Black Shirts and Reds by Michael Parenti and am about 1/5 of the way through.\n\nIt\u2019s like everywhere I\u2019m reminded about where society is heading because of capitalism. The news from the US scares me. It just seems inescapable and the threat is always there of what is to come from oligarchy. \n\nAre there signs that society will get better? Is there something that is being done or can be done? Is it worth just blocking it out so I can live in peace?",

What I realized is that WE have to be the sign that things will get better. Join a communist party near you and begin to help with organizing the fight for a better world. If there aren't any near you, find one you align with and become a party builder. It isn't an easy thing to do, but if you wanna know what can be done, that's it. \n\nOrganize within your local community. Get into a party that holds physical meetings with people; it really helps with mental health and getting out of doom spirals, knowing that you have that group of comrades to talk with and to discuss/organize direct action and providing aid to your community. That's what helped me get outta the news-reading \"we're all so doomed,\" mindset without shutting off all connections with the real world. It's hard and spooky a lot of days, but a better world IS possible, comrade. Never let those thoughts of hopelessness take control, because then we've truly lost.
