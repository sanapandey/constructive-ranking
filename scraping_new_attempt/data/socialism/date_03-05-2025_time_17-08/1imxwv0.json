They reflect the rising outrage and national resistance against Trump and the oligarchs backing him, as well as the latent anti-MAGA majority that is swiftly finding its voice and unifying against mass deportations, the firing of federal workers, attacks on trans individuals and democratic rights.\n\n>\u201cWe are here to tell Senators Durbin and Duckworth that business as usual is not an option. We have to shut it down!\u201d declared Jason Rieger, a leader of the [Indivisible Chicago Alliance](https://indivisiblechicago.com/). Rieger was speaking at an energetic rally at Federal Plaza, organized by a coalition of groups including Indivisible, Citizen Action, People\u2019s Lobby, Palenque, SEIU, Equality Illinois, and others. Indivisible delivered letters from chapters across Illinois urging the senators to be more vocal against the attack on the U.S. Constitution and democracy.",

It's still a strategy that should likely be taken, but there's more to it than just traditional politics.",

Tens of thousands of left wing leaders, politicians, intellectuals and activists thought of better ideas and implemented them in the US before. None of them worked. One of those that did not work was doing what was proposed here - 'Try to change it from within'.\n\n>is not a sign that the only way to work is though the institutions in place.\n\nAll the institutions in place are developed to prevent such change from happening.

But I agree that there needs to be more skepticism about the role of organizations like USAID in spreading US propaganda and control. The organization can't simply be brought back to its previous form; it needs to be radically changed.\n\n\nAlso, when I hear Musk and Trump talking about cutting into the Pentagon's budget and opening that up for scrutiny, I have mixed feelings. I support the general idea, I just don't trust them to actually do it or to do it for the right reasons.\n\n\nI also don't like the role of Democratic lawmakers like Tim Kaine in some of these protests. Working people should not allow themselves to be co-opted by establishment politicians.\n\n\nNevertheless, seeing people stand up for immigrant rights, some people draped in Palestinian flags, people calling for an end to the domination of society by the rich... these are\u00a0good expressions of popular resistance, and we need to build on that momentum as a foundation for increasingly revolutionary actions.",

You'll know you're doing that when they send soldiers to kill you. \n\nSo, if you're going to protest, it has to disrupt business as usual, it has to affect the ruling class *directly,* and it can't stop until the demands are met. If you only protest for an hour, a day, a week, or even a month, they will just wait it out. An effective protest has no end point until those you're protesting against capitulate.\n\nSo, the way to do this is a total shutdown of the economy. When none of the work gets done, you will have the full and undivided attention of the ruling class. They will try to force you to go back to work. They will threaten, assault, and even murder you to get you back to work.",
