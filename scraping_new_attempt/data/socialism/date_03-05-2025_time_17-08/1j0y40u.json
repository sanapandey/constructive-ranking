    "selftext": "I'm genuienly confused why most of his moves are often so favorably for Russia.\n\nThis doesn't come from a pro US anti Russia perspective. This is just me genuinely confused what the deal is with him. I don't buy the conspiracies theories that he is some sort of anti US pro Russia Agent \"controlled\" by Putin to destroy the US from within. (No i think what happened with zelensky wasnt planned either)\n\nHim being paid as a motive makes no sense. Trump doesn't need to do something illegal with Putin to make immense money. He got enough possibilities for that within the US.\n\nAdding to that most conservatives hate Russia and think it's socialism. Most people in his camp have the classic republican position: Anti Russia no matter what. As an European it confuses me what exactly he wants and what that means.\n\nMaybe I'm forgetting something, it just genuinely confuses me.",

I don't think the blow-up at the negotiation was intended either. Trump is just unbelievably petulant and prone to burning anyone who isn't absolutely and completely servile.\n\n>Adding to that most conservatives hate Russia and think it's socialism. Most people in his camp have the classic republican position: Anti Russia no matter what.\n\nA lot of people in the American conservative base have a favorable view of Russia and Putin. The whole \"anti-woke\" agenda of U.S. conservatives is mirrored in Russia, and many, including Trump, like Russia's authoritarian flavor. A good portion of U.S. cons also view Ukraine as a welfare queen that needs to be cut off.",

            "body": "America is threatened by the rise of China and its own imperial decline. So sections of its ruling class are in conflict over how to treat Russia in relation to China's ascent to superpower status. Either undermine Russia and use a bordering nation unfriendly and desperate (Ukraine) to engage in a conflict with it, or appeal to Russia so that it could break away from any bloc that China consolidates around it, which would work well because Russia borders China (ironically this very game was played with China itself for the purpose of undermining the USSR. It was arguably very successful in the long run, and is one of the major reasons why I'm not a Maoist, but I digress). Trump is representative of the latter which after coming to power is now dominant. The events we've seen recently in context should not be regarded as unpredictable as Trump's platform was that \"\\[he\\] will end the war in Ukraine\", nor isolated i.e. Tucker Carlson's interview with Putin, Mearsheimer's critiques of NATO and the US particularly for the Russia-Ukraine war, etc.",
