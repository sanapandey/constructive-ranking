Lots of socialist leaders were really admired \n\nWe had to shift to Canada because my parents got employment there. And basically I\u2019m always discovering some new myth about a socialist leader\n\nChe Guevara: apparently ran camps for the lgbtq community like hitler.\n\nHo Chi Minh is a \u201ccontroversial leader\u201d. Idk why he seems to be pretty unproblematic to me\n\nAnd like they get really weird with it. I want to get a western perspective on how deep the indoctrination is. ",

            "body": "I can't speak for cultures outside the USA, but yeah, it's kinda just like that here. Every accusation that could possibly be lodged at socialism/socialist leaders is, and it's beaten into your head from a very early age that socialism is the government controlling literally every aspect of your life down to the minutest detail. A lot of Americans treat socialism as an equivalent or even greater evil than fascism. The general perception of \"socialism\" has been beginning to change over the last decade or so, mostly due to figures like Bernie Sanders and the fact that the Republican Party will call literally anything they oppose socialism, but it's still widely misunderstood. A lot of what socialist orgs here even do is just pushing back against that perception of us as evil totalitarians and try to educate people about what socialism is and how it would benefit the working class. But even there, the term \"working class\" has only recently been reintroduced to our political lexicon, for a long time politicians were touting their support for the \"middle class.\" So many people I've spoken to have claimed to not be working class because they just think that means a cohort of poor people they can safely look down on. It's pretty rough!",

Why do they refer to the co-ops as \u201cusual communists?\u201d\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve been told, co-ops in the US are fairly difficult to even start due to investors perceiving it as a higher risk than having some typical CEO-lead company; investors mostly want to ensure their return on investment rather than caring about the company culture, values, or that the product they\u2019re selling is beneficial for society",

I\u2019ll give you two examples \n\n\nExample one; The Gulag Archipelago and its author. (I\u2019m copying this from a comment I left elsewhere before).\n\n\u201cBeing a fabrication of the Nazis and their Ukrainian collaborators, the theory of the \u201cdeliberate man-made famine\u201d in Ukraine was adopted in the post-war years by U.S. and Western European imperialism and, at the same time, by the bourgeois historiography, within the context of the anti-communist campaign of the U.S. and their allies against the Soviet Union and the socialist countries\u201d (Truth and Lies about the famine in Ukraine.  Nikos Mottas)\n\nIn regards to Solzhenitsyn, an anti semite and Russian nationalist with very close ties to Vladimir Putin \u201cEven people who have nothing friendly to say about Stalin admit that Solzhenitsyn\u2019s work is nothing but fairy tales. Let\u2019s see what trotskyite historian and writer Vadim Z. Rogovin writes: \u201cSolzhenitsyn\u2019s work, much like the more objective works of R. Medvedev, belong to the genre which the West calls \u201coral history,\u201d i.e., research which is based almost exclusively on eyewitness accounts of participants in the events being described. Moreover, using the circumstance that the memoirs from prisoners in Stalin\u2019s camps which had been given to him to read had never been published, Solzhenitsyn took plenty of license in outlining their contents and interpreting them\u201d . In fact, Solzenitsyn edited and cited, according to his own reactionary views, third parties\u2019 testimonials in which he added anticommunist fabrications thus creating the \u201cArchipelago\u201d fairy tale\u201d\n\nMore or less, Reshetovskaya (his ex wife) actually says that \u201cGulag Archipelago\u201d isn\u2019t a work that should be taken seriously or accepted as a valid source. The fact that Solzhenitsyn\u2019s book is full of lies and inaccuracies is something that can be confirmed by a comparison of the data presented in the \u201cGulag Archipelago\u201d with the real numbers. There lies a significant problem for the credibility of the much celebrated \u201cnobelist\u201d and former Nazi collaborator Solzhenitsyn: He presents fake numbers!\n\n\nExample 2; \n\n\u201cA victory of communism would be much more dangerous for the United States than a victory for fascism\u201d -US Senator Robert A. Taft\n\n\u201cIf we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible.. \u2022 Harry Truman, 1941.",

In Catalonia specially are decently regarded, in general because they were the main opposition to Franco, and the transition, at least in rhetoric, was an \"agreement to leave behind past hostilities\". More and more talking points from the US are being imported, but I would say it's not all that generalized. Obviously we have our fair share of \"ancaps\" (mostly fascists) of the style of Milei, and for what I know it's something present mainly in Spanish-speaking countries. But at least in my experience are more invisibilized and misunderstood than hated.",
