    "selftext": "Since recently coming off my antidepressant, which I was on for six years, I've been more outraged at the ridiculousness of capitalism and its impact on society more than ever.\n\nI live in the UK where our most of our public utilities are owned by pension funds and  foreign sovereign wealth funds. E.g. water companies have a complete geographic monopoly, so for London, Thames water is your only choice and it's majority shareholder is Canadian. They just profit off us, don't invest in infrastructure, and pump shit into our rivers. AND we just go on with our lives like that's a normal fucking thing and makes sense.\n\nIf you talk about taking stuff back into public ownership you are hit with 'we can't afford it', I didn't say buy it I said take it! 'the markets won't like that' - oh yes the democratically elected markets who control our economies to ensure we are playing ball with their neoliberal rulebook. What a surprise they won't like it. How can you not go mad in a world that is so illogical?\n\nObviously I have always been aware of this stuff, but the anger and hopelessness of living in a crooked society, filled with rampant inequality, where the fat cats carry on getting exponentially bigger, is overwhelming.\n\nWho wouldn't want some soma to survive in this society? Odd that 15% of the population all need medication to get by - surely we should look at some root causes - capitalism is undoubtedly massive contributor to anxiety, depression, and nihilism.\n\n**Edit: This post is not in anyway an encouragement for anyone to come off antidepressants or to demonise them, it was merely an insight into capitalism's role in the mental health epidemic. There is definitely some merit to this, and there is books on the topic e.g. 'Sedated by James Davies'. However, This does not mean people should not use antidepressants, which have helped so many people, including myself. Please always consult your doctor before making any medical related decisions.**",
