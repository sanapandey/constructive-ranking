There was one Greek anarchist who went on a helicopter tour then allegedly attempted to hijack the helicopter to free the prisoners, but she failed and a massive anti terror campaign was unleashed looking to find her and others. When they arrested some of them police claim they had multiple fake passports, and all kinds of ammo. This was occuring when people within the prisons were on Bobby sands style hunger strikes backed by mass demonstrations, and threats in the air outside the prison walls.",
