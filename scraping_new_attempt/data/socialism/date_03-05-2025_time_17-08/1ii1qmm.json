    "selftext": "I'm ideologically a commie because I got lucky enough to be assigned the Manifesto in a high school class and liked what I saw.  One of the (many) things that affirms my status as such is the arts.  Capitalism perverts the arts obscenely. Not only does capitalism force artists to become businessmen just to get recognition and a livelihood, it does something I think is far worse.  \n\nThe greatest artists of our generation are randos on social media with less than 10 followers.  They will post a masterpiece that brings you to tears like once a month, the post will get 2 likes, and they will stop posting because they're sick of wasting their precious time trying to game an unfair algorithm rigged against them.\n\nThe greatest artists of our generation are burned out disasters who are too busy working soul-sucking jobs they hate and haven't made anything in months.  They feel their creative sparks being snuffed out inside of them because all their mental and physical energy is being drained for no one's benefit except the stockholders.\n\nThe greatest artists of our generation have never picked up a paintbrush, or a microphone, or a camera, or anything else, because they don't think they can.  They've been told they're not good enough, palatable enough, marketable enough to even TRY.  They've been told the arts are pointless endeavors for spoiled rich kids, and they should go off and get a useful job, no matter how much they despise giving all their time to something they have no passion for.  They're too busy raising kids, making ends meet with endless work or just trying to survive to even pick up the arts as a hobby.\n\nEven if you're not potentially one of the greatest artists of our generation, even if you suck complete ass at art, this stuff happening to you is still a tragedy.  I believe that art is the birthright of all human beings, and that every person should be able to just try it and see if they like it, whether they're good at it or not. You should be allowed to make art even if it's shitty.  Bad art is better than no art, more importantly, you enjoyed making it! And maybe someone else enjoyed experiencing it! It makes me so unbelievably sad that some people, even other communists, think that the arts are only for the wealthy or elitist snobs, when that is so not true!  Some of the best artists in the world were peasants and proletarians, the biggest reason we associate the arts with the elites is because they're the ones most likely to have the money and time to pursue them!\n\nArt is something so irrevocably human, something so ancient in our development that it's almost synonymous with humanity (that's why it's part of the humanities studies).  The mere idea that capitalism ripped so many people away from it or fucked up their relationship to it just to enrich the tiniest percentage of the planet makes me so goddamn angry.\n\n One of the biggest reasons I'm a socialist is because I want there to be a society where everyone is free to do art if they want to.  There's a pretty good Oscar Wilde essay about this topic: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Soul\\_of\\_Man\\_Under\\_Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_Man_Under_Socialism)\n\nAny other socialist artists feel the same?",

            "body": "Yes, absolutely. \n\nI am a professional animator. I am also an animator who has a day job that I fucking hate doing, but I do it because it\u2019s a decent arrangement that lets me do my night job.\n\nI consider the relationship I have between myself and my art to be one of the most integral foundations toward why I am a socialist.\n\nI will, till the day I die, go to my grave clenching my fists in pure malding rage knowing that my potential was forever kneecapped by unfettered capitalism. I hate that my worth as an animator is going to come down to \u201cHave you ever worked for Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks/Sony/whatever other major prestigious studio?\u201d I forever feel burdened by the anger of knowing that there are great ideas in my head that want to come out, and they are limited purely by time and money. I do not have the time to sit and animate as much as I\u2019d like to. If I could, I would wake up in the morning, animate for 16 hours straight with breaks to shower, eat, and pee, and then go to sleep and do it all over again in the morning. I hate that if I ever want to get through a project faster, I need to sit down and put money down toward hiring an entire pipeline of people with licenses for software and connections with distributors in order to make a major project happen. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even to mention how toxic the relationship between the employer and employee is in these major studios. I get borderline no creative input. I do not get to choose what projects I want to spend my time on. I do not get to take a day off during crunch when the project is nearing completion. I do not get any semblance of job security between the contracted gig nature of it and the looming threat that AI has been posing toward all our livelihoods.\n\nI hate all of how this works. I do not give five shits about my main job. I, I shit you not, sell air to people for a living (I want the absurdity of this sentence to rest for a bit and just linger, because that\u2019s about as in depth as I\u2019ll ever go toward my day job). \n\nI hate the contrast of this beautiful, wonderful thing that, when I get into a flow, makes me feel grateful to be alive. I love the feeling of capturing the magic of the human body in motion and bringing a puppet with no ability to emote or think to life. \n\nBy contrast, I hate my fucking job so much. I hate talking about air. I feel my life drain away from my face when I have to give the same fucking sales pitch for the millionth time about the benefits of my air. I hate it even more when people say \u201cYes, I want to sit here and breathe this air\u201d, because then that means I need to drop what I\u2019m doing, which is funnily enough, animating, because my job is slow enough where it doesn\u2019t matter if I bring my laptop with Maya over and work on it all day as long as I make the money, to sit there and watch them breathe their bullshit fucking air for a bit.\n\nI will die regretting not having animated more. All things said, I\u2019m lucky that I even get to use my job as a mini office for my creative work. Other artists don\u2019t even get that. I could leave and find another job that pays slightly better, but I\u2019m aware that if I leave and do anything that isn\u2019t a studio job, I\u2019m going to be stuck at some other job I hate equally unable to access my computer because I\u2019ll be on my feet all fucking day selling burgles to people instead.\n\nMy art has only ever made me a bigger socialist. I have hit the point where I yearn to live in a socialist, or fuck it, even communist society that would unburden me from my fucking day job and let me tackle my craft unshackled. I wish I could just get a stipend in exchange for proof that I\u2019m making work happen or something. I hate it when I say this to liberals who tell me \u201cWhy the fuck should I pay for your art?\u201d when the response is easily \u201cBecause you do not know if I am the next Richard Williams or Glenn Keane of animation. Investing this money into me, even if I do not become the next Richard Williams or Glenn Keane, will yield work that only contributes toward the betterment of humanity anyway\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe I have an overinflated worth of what\u2019s essentially cartoons and moving puppets, but I see sheer *beauty* in it. The untarnished beauty of seeing these moving pictures on the screen is constantly sullied by the shackles capitalist society has put on it. The other day, I felt *so much pride* in a project I made for showing it to my wife, and seeing her start cracking up in tears over watching one of my characters make a little movement that I had used myself as reference for and having her yell out \u201cOh my god, that\u2019s actually just you!!!!! You have a habit of doing that exact thing your character did, and I know this is a very you specific thing!!!!\u201d. Capitalism robs me of more experiences I\u2019ll carry to my grave like this.\n\nThere\u2019s my rant about this. I am sorry that it is long winded, but I have been thinking so much about my relationship to my craft lately, and you pushed a button in me with the question you\u2019ve posed. Truly, I hate this fucking planet that I live in for robbing me of the thrill and fulfillment I get out of doing this one craft.",

Before the Renaissance art was very clearly dedicated to implying the nobility was guided by \"God\".  It supported the notion of obedience to authority.  It was a kind of brainwashing.\n\nThe Renaissance was all about individual greatness.  It was iconoclastic.  It rose in support of the new idea of private business.\n\n\"Everyone free to do art if they want to\".   You're taking me back to hippy days.   Hippy artist colonies and shops were everywhere.
