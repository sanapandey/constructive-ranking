Like you have Redditors talking about how only the \"privileged\" didn't vote for Harris. It's disgusting. The idea that Democrats could just not support genocide doesn't even cross their mind. It leaves us with a ghoulish game where the Democratic leadership expects us to accept continuously worse positions, supposedly to protect the most vulnerable among us. Of course, as the positions veer towards reaction more strongly, those same vulnerable groups are cut off from protection one by one anyway.\n\nI try to find solace in the fact that this will only hasten the demise of the Democratic Party. Well, I hope it does at least.",
