    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWhile I know that there is a reading list for this subreddit, it's empty as to books that focus on a broad history of money and the economy from a leftist perspective, with a particular focus on modern financialization, move from the gold standard, etc. This is too large a topic for one book to cover completely, but if anyone here had recommendations of some broad surveys I would appreciate them. Hard to trust the widely read \"history of money\" type books by people like Niall Ferguson or the dude from Planet Money.",
