    "selftext": "Lets imagine someone who is completely motivated by individualism. They'll only do something if it benefits them in the short-term and ethics have no sway on them.\n\nThis is the kind of person who, if they didn't have kids, would vote to shut down every public school right now if that same money could be used to reduce their personal food prices, for example.\n\nThis is the kind of person who doesn't care about climate change because they live in a location that didn't suffer negative consequences from it in the short-term.\n\nThis is the kind of person who doesn't feel fundamentally alienated or depressed by working under capitalism: They're 'happy enough' that the efforts of transitioning to socialism, they make enough money, they don't mind ads, and consumerism, and the uncertainty involved in transition, would likely appear to be a downgrade to their quality of life.\n\nThis is the kind of person who doesn't trust democracy because 'plenty of people don't vote for what's best for them anyway', so the idea of a democratic economy doesn't appeal to them.\n\nThis is the kind of person who acknowledges that lots of people already disagree with them, so the idea of voting 'against the grain' doesn't turn them off.\n\nThis is the kind of person who is happy to talk politics with friends and family, but doesn't care when everyone calls them an a**hole because, hey, what incentive do they have to be nice to others right now instead of doing what's best for them right now?\n\nThis person has friends anyway, because like-minded individualists exist in the world, and this person is generally a good friend because they care about their friends, they just have no regard for the larger world. As such, they are swayed by what's good for their friends, but not swayed by friends' arguments that XYZ would be good for the larger world. They'd vote to keep education if their friends had kids, but not if their friends would disown them because other people in the world have kids. They would merely see those friends as going against their own best interests.\n\nThis is the kind of person with no sense of ethics or morality beyond 'I do what's best for me right now'.\n\n---------------\n\nI know this kind of person exists. On paper, I see no way to convince someone like that that socialism is appealing.\n\nMy background in adult education tells me that this person is at a very low level of moral maturity. This suggests that the solution is for society to nurture moral education and evolve people to more nuanced, sophisticated ethical identities - In other words, the solution may be to say that this person needs an ethical education, at which point they would desire socialism.\n\nMy concern with that strategy is that this person may fight back, argue 'indoctrination' and feel like they're being told that they can't be who they are and that they have to change because of some 'social agenda'. They may argue that socialism is just 'begging the question' in a way - of course if we convince people to have higher morals, they'll see socialism appealing, but what about the here and now where plenty of people are just not swayed by ethics, and are content enough? They'll never support it.\n\nI'm trying to find a way to argue that socialism is appealing regardless of who you are.\n\nPaulo Freire and Marx talk about alienation and dehumanization as major driving forces for a universal appeal of socialism, but it doesn't seem like this person feels particularly alienated or dehumanized.\n\nI want to, of course, argue that they are in fact feeling many negative effects of capitalism and that the transition is worth it, but that's a tough sell for someone like this.\n\nThere must be a way to appeal to the most selfish-egotistical a**hole out there and build an argue that socialism is good for them, but I can't find it. Every strategy I see comes back to class consciousness, agapism (disinterested love for others), or falling quality of life and / or wide-scale destruction.\n\nThe only other argument I can think of is a logical one: Capitalism isn't sustainable, socialism is, there there's a rational reason to change.\n\nBut again, this person is going to say 'yeah, but transitions are hard and scary and not worth it to me, I'm gonna pull a NIMBY and make that someone else's struggle'.\n\nThe way forward in my mind is to build a stronger sense of ethics into the population, OR let capitalism destroy lives so badly that even the most egotistical megalomaniac would revolt and demand socialism. \n\nBut again, this person would say 'who are you to tell me what ethics to live by? Go away!' They'll be turned off by all of that. So how do we reach someone like that? \n\nAgain, my education tells me that the solution is time: Society needs time to build the sophisticated understanding required for socialism, and this person is just a particularly 'slow hiker'.\n\n**How do we prevent that kind of person from being a barrier to humanity's progress?**\n\n**How does the socialist project deal with the fact that there are humans like this?**",

But I'm fine with the status quo, therefore it's obviously fine for everyone. Anyone complaining is confused/lazy/duped.\" In which case I think simply getting them out of their bubble of bias would go a long way towards generating empathy, which could build a foundation for questioning the current system.\n\n\nBut, how do you burst a bubble in the land of propaganda? How do you break down a social feedback loop? How do you get people to see and experience how life is for others? A lot of people won't even try an unfamiliar cuisine!\n\n\n\nI do recall watching a video several years ago where people were questioned about their views on gay rights. Then, one-on-one meetings with gay people were arranged for the questionees; they got to know them and learn about their life experiences. They then retook the survey and their opinions had shifted to be less conservative on gay rights.\n\n\nI don't know how you'd scale up that kind of experience. But it does give me hope.",

            "body": "An egoist isn't \"someone interested in their own well personal being\" alone. Egoism is another term for nihilism as related to Max Stirner. Max Stirner was one of the early materialist thinkers, and inspired the Russian nihilist struggle (along with other thinkers). This Russian nihilism created the revolutionary conditions for Russian Marxism to appear. It directly influences lenin, and the early birth of anarcho communism. It was the first buds of \"left materialism\".\n\n\nThe core perspective is that one views everything through the lense of themselves. It's not a negation of the collective but the realization of the individuality of perception, interest and survival. Does capitalism, or constantly robbing your neighbor seem like something that's in your individual self interest, or does solidarity and rebellion seem more beneficiary? These questions are an example of the early individualist perspectives. Another nihilist position in egoism is that \"morality\" of a Christian or religious nature has been imposed upon the working class to convince them to deny their ego and await pleasure, freedom in the \"next life\". So in their early russian uprisings they saw themselves as \"negating\" this morality by \"acting upon their desires now\". \n\n\n \"Stirner's variant of\u00a0property theory\u00a0is similarly dialectical, where the concept of\u00a0ownership\u00a0is only that personal distinction made between what is one's property and what is not. Consequentially, it is the exercise of control over property which constitutes the nonabstract possession of it\". This is a polar opposite of ayn rand.\n\n\nMaybe educate this person on this history so they can see how anti capitalist ideas actually have individualistic roots. America's individualism is a false rugged individualism.\n\n\n(Before anyone even attempts to debate me, I'm not an egoist, but like any marxist inspired leftist i utilize some of the same theories. This is more of a historical explanation than a position)",

You are not Jesus for socialism. \n\nI have had luck with them on their own job and their interactions with government. At the end of the day everyone wants money or resources in surplus so their needs can be met in surplus. \n\nAn interaction I had last week at the local game store about unions. I told a guy why would your company hide all of its equity in a Christian charity? Is it because if you organize with your coworkers you could ask for an Employee Ownership Program? Yes, that's why it's in the charity the family owns. \n\nHe got on the side of pro unions because I showed him examples of how he is getting shafted by his company. I hope he then goes and talks to his coworkers about this. This is not a shift towards socialism but it's a shift towards getting away from individualism into collectivism. This helps the movement in the long run because then we can move more left on the next push.",
