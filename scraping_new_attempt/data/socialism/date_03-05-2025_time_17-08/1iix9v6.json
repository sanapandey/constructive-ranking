    "selftext": "\nIn the past decade\u2014and especially in just the last few months\u2014the ultra-wealthy have become shameless in revealing how deeply they\u2019ve rigged the system in their favor. America has amassed more wealth than any civilization in human history, yet the vast majority of its people struggle to afford basic necessities.\n\nThere are roughly 750 billionaires in the United States, a nation of 335 million people. We all know the answer to the question: \u201cWhy do we let this happen?\u201d But the real question is, how much longer will the institutions designed to keep the public just satisfied enough to prevent revolt continue to hold?\n\nFor the first time, I believe we may see this system collapse within the next two years\u2014perhaps sooner, depending on how aggressively figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump continue to erode stability.\n\nThere are clear signs that the public is nearing a breaking point:\n\t\u2022\tThe widespread sympathy for Luigi Mangione. He has become a modern-day folk hero, a symbol of rage against corporate greed. Many don\u2019t just understand why he did it\u2014they view it as justified.\n\t\u2022\tThe GameStop short squeeze wasn\u2019t just about money. Millions of retail investors held their shares not to profit, but to burn Citadel and expose Wall Street\u2019s corruption. It was an act of defiance.\n\t\u2022\tUnionization is surging. Amazon, Starbucks, Boeing, and others are seeing unprecedented worker strikes and union drives, a clear sign that people are done accepting scraps.\n\t\u2022\tElon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg have become villains. And not just to the left\u2014resentment against these men is increasingly bipartisan.\n\nThe system that protects billionaires at the expense of the people is fragile. Once the illusion of fairness collapses, history tells us what happens next.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t if the backlash is coming. It\u2019s when.\n\nCurious to hear others\u2019 thoughts\u2014do you think we\u2019re heading toward a reckoning? And if so, how soon?",

The billionaire class are confident they can pick up the pieces and will make it happen.\n\nWhether the reckoning that follows can be harnessed into actual work towards socialist goals is perhaps a bit more debatable. I also have a strong suspicion that the United States cannot sustain itself as a united country and will fragment into a series of successor states. The world is getting smaller and so are states.\n\nThere is a deep hatred of the inequities of the current system. That will need to be harnessed to create a movement rooted in socialist ideals. Rage is well and good but it needs to be transformed into goals, ideals, and education. I'm not sure if a lot of that is going on.\n\nOtherwise, I fear that this backlash can be harnessed very effectively by fascists and corporations to tighten their grip. They seem prepared to do so, and confident that they can. There are still a lot of brainwashed people out there who have been very, *very,* effectively propagandized (I know because I was/am one of them).\n\nIf the United States does splinter, socialism may have a chance to flourish in some of the successor territories that emerge. But I suspect a significant part of the population will end up under some kind of fascist or capitalist system.\n\nTLDR: I agree that a reckoning is coming but a strong socialist movement needs to be ready to pick up the pieces afterward, and to fight the fascist billionaires who will look to carve out their own kingdoms.",

Until this changes, we\u2019re stuck where we are, which sadly, may be a long time. But that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s impossible. \n\nAs a retired public relations consultant, who specialized in creating systematic communications plans for organizational change, I know:\n\nThe first thing we have to do is find some commonality between the divided left and right. What are our shared values, beliefs and attitudes? \n\nNext we\u2019ll have to discover a shared lexicon so we can avoid divisive trigger words (Socialism will likely be among those, at least in the beginning.) and use them to create detailed \u201ctalking points\u201d or messages so we can engage them in a respectful conversation based on our shared ideas. \n\nThen we have to \u201ctest\u201d those messages in small group conversations (think focus groups) to learn which ones resonate best so we can refine and use those and discard the ineffective ones. \n\nWe\u2019d also have to identify and recruit some credible spokespeople with a bit of notoriety whom our target audience trusts and would listen to. \n\nThen we have to find out and establish a credible presence in those spaces where our target audience typically looks for information and engage them in an open dialogue where we invite them to share their own ideas for creating a better, fairer, more compassionate society moving forwards. This mutuality in sharing and creating ideas is important because it creates buy-in; they will be \u201cinvested\u201d in the change. \n\nThen, together, we have to create detailed action plans with a timeline, list of priorities, and assignments of who will do what and when to achieve our mutual objectives. \n\nAs you can see, this would require a lot of organization, planning, manpower and dedication. It would also require some significant financial support from well-heeled individuals or organizations who are interested in its success. It requires a lot more effort than simply venting on social media platforms but the effort would be worth it. \n\nHow do we start?",

The leadership on both the left and right have mastered the art of rallying their bases against each other, ensuring that division remains a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo. As long as this polarization persists, any meaningful reckoning will be difficult to achieve.\n\nI also agree that we should avoid targeting MAGA voters as a whole and instead keep the focus on the billionaires and entrenched politicians who actively uphold the existing power structure. While there will always be a faction that remains unwavering in their support of figures like Trump or Musk, there are many who voted for Trump not out of ideological purity, but because they were led to believe that DEI initiatives, the trans community, Muslims, Jews\u2014essentially whichever \u201cother\u201d is convenient at the moment\u2014are the true culprits behind their struggles.\n\nThe challenge is reaching those who haven\u2019t been entirely indoctrinated and helping them see that, in reality, we share the same fight. Interestingly, Musk\u2019s recent fall from grace within some right-wing circles illustrates how quickly allegiances can shift when power structures no longer serve certain interests. Similarly, the response to Luigi Mangione\u2019s situation shows that, at least in some cases, even traditionally conservative voices can express sympathy when confronted with clear injustice. These moments indicate that perspectives can evolve, which brings me to your key question: How do we start?\n\nI\u2019d argue that we already have. The real question now is how to sustain and build on this momentum. This will likely require a reckoning on the left as well\u2014are we willing to extend an olive branch and collaborate with those who once stood against us, despite deep-seated ideological differences? I believe we\u2019ll need to, because if there\u2019s any real hope of uniting against the ultra-wealthy class, it will require a broad coalition that transcends traditional partisan lines.\n\nOf course, for many, this approach will feel like conceding too much. That\u2019s understandable. But in my view, it\u2019s the only viable path forward. Avoiding inflammatory language, identifying shared values, and strategically fostering common ground will be crucial steps in this process. If we can commit to that, then yes\u2014a reckoning and even a revolution is possible. But only if we\u2019re willing to put aside our differences long enough to recognize the real battle at hand.",

Having elections and even legislation determined by money from the billionaire class and big corporations instead of the best interests constituents is the very definition of corruption and it\u2019s a plague on both parties. Moreover, our legislators enjoy the gravy train of a very generous salary, pension, healthcare\u2014all of which they vote for themselves. This immunizes them from the effects of cutting benefits for the rest of us.
