    "selftext": "Basically, I'm a pretty young student (about 15) and I've learned communism for like 2 years during Covid. After basically sitting on my arse for 3 years, I decided that it's finally time to do something useful! So I seek to create an underground movement of communist students like me to both study and organise, and if I'm lucky, maybe build up some proletarian (a.k.a. adult) support too.\n\nSo, anyone with experience at organising here, how do you create a movement? What's the common problem with movements? How do you keep everyone interested? How to remain consistent with it? How to build up support? How to not get caught?   \n  \nI've written some basics about socialism for my classmates to read (although I had to make another friend write it down for me and make him use plastic gloves so we don't get caught or isolated like weirdos) and distribute it randomly among class's desk drawers. Whenever my family dinner get a political discussion and I join in, my parents would always try to press me down through talking about how \"progressive\" our little state are (I get it, arresting drug dealers and terrorists is good, but capitalism isn't) and bullshit like \"oh the theories you've read about socialism and all is smuggled by emigres that want to destroy our great nation\" (like bro what the hell **\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d**).   \n  \nAlthough they didn't state it, I can still understand that the working population wouldn't support a student that hasn't even faced life yet, let alone supporting that guy could lead to your arrest.\n\nAny help?",
