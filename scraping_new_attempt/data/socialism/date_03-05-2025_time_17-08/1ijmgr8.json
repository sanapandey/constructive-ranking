And there will be a group project, but I probably won't find a single socialist in my class. \n\nDoes a course like this worth my time? Should I continue, or drop it?\n\nEdit: Thank y'all for your responses! I guess I'll continue taking the course :D ",

Not gonna find perfect courses...take this one, it will give you a chance to understand their definition and probably hone some skills in debating their concepts against your view...and might convert some people. \n\nAt the very least, you'll get credits and maybe learn something about yourself and your politics along the way.",

If you want then go ahead, but be ready to criticize and question everything you hear since you\u2019re a socialist/communist, it should be your approach.",

Democracy is a broad topic and you will not be covering every aspect of it in class. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not valuable or you shouldn\u2019t learn about it. I\u2019m guessing you are in undergrad, you are getting a pretty broad education. You don\u2019t start specializing in a specific topic until grad school.",
