They have now joined hands with the Indian National Congress\u2014a liberal party that has always supported big corporations and capitalists. Ironically, there was a time when the CPI(M) even teamed up with the far-right BJP just to remove Congress from power.\n\nI grew up under a Communist government in an Indian state, and it\u2019s disappointing that they still call themselves a Communist party. They privatized electricity, took land from poor farmers, and gave it to big businesses. When the farmers protested, they killed hundreds.\n\nRecently, in their state conference, they passed a resolution saying the BJP should not be called \"fascists\" but \"neo-fascists.\" As if that small difference in words changes anything.",

They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. \n\nLet the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.

Instead it's largely people with firsthand experience with this party or who are active in other sites of revolutionary struggle. \n\nIf anything, the bigger trend among western \"communists\" is to view criticism as a problem in itself. This isn't a new issue, and can be seen in the Communist Party of China's criticism of the CPUSA in the 60s. Correct lines and politics in the International Communist Movement must be consistently and actively struggled for, and must be *international*. You don't get to sit out line struggle, because these debates anywhere are directly relevant to your revolution as well. That's the nature of an Internationalist struggle.\n\nHiding cowardice towards being incorrect or struggling with others behind false humility won't get any of us anywhere.",
