    "selftext": "As the title states, I want books from a leftist/socialist perspective, or at the very least not American propaganda. *Dark Alliance* is on my list which I heard is tangentially related, as well as Chomsky's *The Culture of Terrorism*. Is there anything I am missing?\n\nCan anyone attest to whether or not Walsh's *Firewall* and/or *Iran-Contra: Reagan\u2019s Scandal & the Unchecked Abuse of Presidential Power* are neutral enough or even any good? Recommend (or advise against) any of the other books on [here](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/the-best-books-on-the-iran-contra-affair.html)? \n\nI'll of course be critically thinking regardless, but I have limited reading time and I'd hate to waste my time.
