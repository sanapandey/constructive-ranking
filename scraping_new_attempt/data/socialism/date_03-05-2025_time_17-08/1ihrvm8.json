    "selftext": "Now that republicans are back in the White House liberals will all become activists again. I'm seeing protests like the 50501 and other thrown together protests popping up on reddit and I know a lot of them are being organized by libs and I assume the majority of the protesters present will be libs. So here's my question, I agree with some of what libs are protesting against shit like conservatives favorite nazi Musk running amok with doge, mass deportations, tariff wars, etc, so is it worth it to show up and show support or should I just wait for socialist organized events and partake in those instead?\n\n",

To turn agitation into organisation.\n\nElse, all you will achieve (being generous) is an aesthetical reform which co-opts existing discontent back into the system and thus provides the same system with yet again another source of legitimation.\n\nThe actual goals of protests are not \"specific policy reforms\", but other forms of goals, such as building solidarities between different movements, building/maintaining cohesion within a movement or reaching out to people.\n\nQuite the contrary, achieving concrete policy changes through political action has usually depended on the parallel and capable presence of more radical, transformative proposals which posed a much greater threat to the status quo.\n\nA *50 cents decrease on public transport hikes* is, by itself, not any more attainable as a demand than *peace, land and bread* by a revolutionary organisation which is able to connect with the people.",

It's just frustrating that some people still insist on hardline dichotomy, as if we're not capable to approach historical contradictions within communist groups dialectically. Back in the brief pre-war period where social fascist theory led to the well know outcomes, one big hurdle was the struggles between personalities in the Komintern, making an approach of synthesized positioning, that is more flexibly responsive to specific situations rather than dogmatic fatalism, impossible. There is no reason we need to continue this fatalism to it's logical conclusion, namely complete schism. But some people simply won't stop insisting, as if those personalities were still alive today and required absolute loyalty (Trotskyites are a relevant example).",

(I would actually argue that the dominant political power in amerika is distinct from fascism in the sense that it is what inspired what we call fascism. It\u2019s older and more effective in its tyranny.) We are not facing a fascist takeover but a fascist continuation. The perpetrators of last year\u2019s genocide should not be understood to be materially different from the purveyors of this year\u2019s.",

Increased persecution of minorities, forced expulsions of foreigners, capitalists directly assuming positions of governance (blatant corporatism), staff being chosen entirely based on loyalty not qualification, flagrant violation of constitutional law. I think it's a fair point that functionally, there is little difference to previous governments, but the fact that a majority of the population doesn't even demand a cosmetic adherence to \"good political etiquette\" anymore is indeed a sign of things advancing towards blatant fascism, as opposed to capitalist imperialism under the typical Western facade of democracy. It's easy to overestimate the difference, as it is easy to underestimate them. Goes both ways.",
