    "selftext": "The U.S. Dept. of Education has launched an End DEI website where anyone can submit a report of discrimination against a district, school, or staff of a school. It would be a shame if the website were filled with reports of divisive educational ideologies like those that promote sexism, racism, religious discrimination, etc. or that focus on loyalty oaths that teacher contracts require in some U.S. states, wherein teachers agree that they have never been party to a group who formerly sought or who actively seek to overturn the state or U.S. constitution. \n\nhttps://enddei.ed.gov \n\nFrom the website:\n\nSchools should be focused on learning. \n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is committed to ensuring all students have access to meaningful learning free of divisive ideologies and indoctrination. This submission form is an outlet for students, parents, teachers, and the broader community to report illegal discriminatory practices at institutions of learning. The Department of Education will utilize community submissions to identify potential areas for investigation.\n\nSigned: A concerned U.S. teacher.",
