I recognize his work against bureaucracy in the early USSR, his advocacy for stronger workers' democracy and so on.\n\nI also see very positively his resistance to Stalin's revisionism but in this regard he was probably too sectarian which forced him to stay isolated, from the London Bureau or the POUM or other organisations. And some trotskyist organisations (though not all and far from it) sometimes reproduce and exacerbate this sectarianism. I joined the Revolutionary Communist Party for 6 month and I was able to witness this firsthand. \n\nDespite all that, his work is a mostly positive one. His theoretical work is very useful especially the Transition program, his emphasis on internationalism and workers' democracy against Stalin's Socialism in One Country was crucial and allowed a non-revisionist marxist tradition to survive on the left and to carry the torch in some places. For instance in France today, despite my own activity in the French Communist Party, in term of visibility and closeness to revolutionary ideas, trotskyist parties are far more active than the Communist Party.",

            "body": "Trotsky is a complicated matter, on one hand important during October revolution and the civil war that followed and was pretty popular with the people. On the other hand, somewhat inconsistent in his views both before October and after. Trotsky was apart of the mensheviks movement before swapping to bolsheviks, because of that many within the bolshevik leadership distrusted him. When it came to Lenin, Trotsky positioned himself as being equal to Lenin in Marxism, while Stalin positioned himself as being a true follower of Lenin. When it comes to positions, Trotsky was seen as the left of the party, wanting to organize soldiers of labor and mass collectivization of agriculture, on the right was Bukharin which wanted a more gradualism approach, Stalin leaned towards the right but would shift to the left in 1933 (I could be wrong). \n\nAfter Lenin died, Stalin sent out telegrams to all party members, expect for Trotsky who he sent the wrong date to on purpose to smear his reputation, Trotsky would then organize the united opposition, which would be made up of  Zinoviev, Kamenev who would late die in the Great purges of 1936. Trotsky would organize a protest during the 10th anniversary of the October revolution which was a violation of party unite and of organizing outside of the party. Trotsky would be exiled from the USSR because of this action. Even after exile, Trotsky would still have influence that would be silence with Trotsky being downplayed in the Russia Revolution.\n\nTrotsky in exile, would be contentious in views saying that Stalin had betrayed the revolution and degraded socialism into a bureaucratic workers state. Trotsky would write polemics against what he called \"Stalinist leadership\" which in function was no different then Marxist-Leninism. Trotsky ism would become a sort of Marx and Lenin with a rejection of everything that came after.",

I value his contributions, such as the theory of \"permanent revolution\" and criticism of the bureaucratization of the USSR under Stalin. For us Trotskyists, Stalinism represents an authoritarian deformation of socialism, marked by political persecution, falsification of history and repression of workers' democracy. Trotsky is a symbol of resistance to this bureaucratic and authoritarian vision, while Stalinism is the abandonment of internationalism and the betrayal of revolutionary ideals. This criticism guides the practice, which seeks to build a classist, anti-capitalist and democratic left, far from hierarchical or dogmatic models.\n\nStalinism constructed a series of lies about Trotsky to justify his political persecution and erase his role in the Russian Revolution. They accused Trotsky of being a \"traitor\", \"counter-revolutionary\" and even an \"agent of fascism\", false narratives that served to legitimize his expulsion from the USSR and, later, his assassination in 1940. Stalin and his bureaucracy rewrote history, downplaying Trotsky's role as leader of the Red Army and central figure in the 1917 Revolution. Furthermore, the Moscow trials of the 1930s used false confessions and trumped-up charges to associate Trotsky with alleged plots against the Soviet state. These lies aimed to consolidate Stalin's power, eliminating any opposition and erasing the memory of one of the main Marxist theorists and revolutionaries. It is necessary to unmask these falsifications and is essential to recover the real history of the socialist struggle and defend an emancipation project based on democracy and internationalism.\n\nThe accusations that Trotsky was a \"Menshevik\" and \"opportunist\" were Stalinist propaganda used to discredit his political figure. Trotsky, in fact, had differences with the Bolsheviks before 1917, especially regarding the organization of the party, but during the Russian Revolution he completely aligned himself with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, becoming one of the main leaders of the revolution. His role as commander of the Red Army and his uncompromising defense of the international revolution demonstrate his commitment to the socialist project. The accusation of \"opportunist\" was a Stalinist manipulation to justify his expulsion and persecution, ignoring his central role in the construction of the Soviet State. These false narratives were part of Stalin's campaign to consolidate his power and eliminate rivals within the communist movement.",

The idea that the revolution needed to be spread relentlessly also appears - in the forms with which I interacted which I recognise might have been misconstrued, misunderstood, or otherwise bastardised by my interlocutors - to not only contrast with other ideas regarding the role of what would nowadays be called the imperial core within the international revolution, but to also ignore historical materialist development in favour of the imposition of Leninist praxis upon as many countries as possible regardless of whether they be semi-feudal, industrial, or agrarian, not just that but it also appears much less pragmatic than Lenin's own approach in trying to immediately stop all ongoing conflicts to at least **try** and stabilise the country as well as prompting development - we are talking about a society that went through about eight years of continuous war against several great bourgeois powers, I would argue they did not have the means to spread much of anything, especially when both war communism and the NEP were... Not socialist, rather socialist-oriented. Essentially, it's like he was trying to spread a socialism that wasn't quite there yet without even having the means to do so.",

Subsequently, this semi-Menshevik scheme of permanent revolution was seized upon by Trotsky (in part by Martov) and turned into a weapon of struggle against Leninism.\n\n- Stalin, [*Some Questions Concerning the History of Bolshevism*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/x01/x01.htm), 1931",

This isn't to say they were implemented perfectly, far from it, but there is quite a jarring difference between critically looking at mistakes committed by a government and just speaking ill of it. Furthermore, just reading *The Revolution Betrayed* shows a Trotsky who quickly goes from explaining his faction's support for rapid industrialisation, claiming that Stalin was waiting too long, to criticising Stalin once he does take a sharp turn in favour of industrialisation, I think that's inconsistent at best, dishonest   \nand petty at worst.\n\n>What does it mean to \"ride the anti-soviet wave\" in modern time?

I think neither Trotskyists nor Stalinists have any right to claim Rosa's figure as \"theirs\". I think using her as though she were some sort of mascot is profoundly disrespectful to her legacy as a great theoritician and influential Marxist thinker and revolutionary. The main issue is... I have only ever seen Trotskyists actually **appropriating** her image, never Stalinists. I have only ever seen Trotskyists being the ones to claim her as someone who would agree with Trotsky, while I have only ever seen Stalinists talk about her for the great revolutionary that she was, without ever claiming her to be a Leninist... Since she wasn't. Again, my experiences aren't all-encompassing, but this is something I have heard from many other people, too, from across leftist tendencies.",

Lenin was aware of Stalin's bureaucratic and authoritarian tendencies, but failed to remove him as he was already very sick at that time.

Trotsky explains that the Stalinist bureaucracy was nothing more than a Thermidorian reaction to the revolution. The revolution had failed to spread internationally and hence a lot of workers had gotten disenchanted since no one was coming to help them. Lenin had said this if a revolution in Germany doesn\u2019t happen then we are dead. This lead the bureaucracy to strengthen their power and once Stalin came to power he decided to get rid of Internationalism as a policy and decided to implement socialism in one state.",

He was an egoistic person, this and his conflicting views with Lenin made most Bolsheviks distrust him, even though he had some popularity. When Lenin passed away, Bolsheviks decided on Stalin who was a trusted Bolshevik that was mostly in background since many years. I feel neutral-positive about early trotsky.\n\nHis followers though have bad reputation and most trotskyists I met completely despise revolutions that was assisted by USSR like Cuba, Vietnam etc... They are also critical about anything you can imagine about the USSR.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that Leon was a co-leader of the revolution rather than a usual subordinate. He considered himself as an equal to Lenin while Stalin considered himself as a follower of Lenin. So the conflict didn't start when Stalin took control, it goes way back in 1903 as far as I know when Leon sided with Mensheviks, even though he denounced his take a year later and sided with Bolsheviks - Lenin was accusing him of being a Menshevik after that whenever they had a conflict. So if Lenin didn't die early he probably would have expelled Trotsky himself",

That being said, I think he contributed far more than he would admit. His crushing of dissenting factions and, most eggregiously, his completely un-socialist militarized labor plan were both pretty bad. That being said, he obviously eventually came around, though this was, conveniently, when the faction breaking hit him and he was no longer in the ruling clique. Afterwards, as he campaigned against Stalin's increasing repression (which has been criticized even by other Marxist-Leninists, like Castro), but his extreme secretarianism and history of doing similar things alienated potential allies to the right and left, and meant he ultimately failed to build a coherent movement. Today, these patterns, and the use of anti-factional militarized-centralism (which was intended by Lenin to be a purely temporary measure), mean that most Trotskyist sects struggle to grow, and inevitably split when political differences arise. I think the earlier, 'standard' democratic centralist model (as was used in the second international by the pre-ww1 Bolsheviks and SPD was far more useful towards building a mass movement. Building a party based not around narrow agreement with every position, but around broad agreement on the goals of the socialist project, and a multitendency culture of open critique and open organization is, in my opinion, the only thing that can bring socialist ideology to the masses, especially in the modern liberal capitalist state.\n\nAll in all, I'm certainly more sympathetic to Trotsky than I am Stalin, and want to read more of his writings, but I have criticisms of him, particularly his inconsistency, secretarianism, and general non-acknowlegement of prior missteps. Also he was kind of a prick to the peasants.",

The collectivization wasn't an actual collectivization as the role of the Soviet was even more reduced to an administrative apparatus and not an actual socialist body of power. Modernisation of farming was also defended first by Trotsky and its allies like Preobrajensky, while Stalin was closer to Bukharin's NEP continuation.\n\nThe 1936 constitution is far from great and wasn't applied in practice anyway. The defeat of fascism isn't due to Stalin but to the Soviet Union as a whole and how many lives could have been spared if Stalin hadn't done the 1936 purges that decapitated the Red Army's leadership and its competent leaders ? And who cares if the Soviet Union is a world super power ? What matters is the proletarian revolution all around the world. And Stalin opposed itself to this goal.\n\nHe threw the german revolutionaries against the wall, he abandonned the greek revolution, ordered the french communists to avoid doing a revolution when they basically could have taken power, he supported the foundation of Israel against the palestinians, he destroyed the Third Internationale, even before he was Secretary General he caused the soviet defeat in the soviet-polish war of 1921.  \nHe was an opportunist and a bureaucrat, denounced by Lenin for his russian nationalism (despite his georgian origin) and his brutality when handling the matters of the state and his relations with the comrades within the party.\n\nHe accompanied the process of bureaucratization of the USSR before and after his nomination at the post of Secretary General. He was an opportunist who switched his ideas, his policies and tried to say anything to put a bad theoretical justification on these changes. He wanted to support the menshevik government. Lenin arrives, he now stands against the mensheviks. He is against collectivisation which is defended by Trotsky and Preobrajensky. He gets to power he has to fight against the right and the peasantry so he does the collectivisation, but without following the actual theoretical thought behind this process and not giving actual power to the peasants. He used to defend international revolution, now he is in power and other revolutions could question his power so international revolutions are now a thing of the past... He buried Lenin's ideas and policies one by one...\n\nAnd the simple fact you call him \"a giant\" as if he was anything else than an average human being as all human beings are says enough about the quality of your marxism.",
