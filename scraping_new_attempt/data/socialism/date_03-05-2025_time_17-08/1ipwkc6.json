    "selftext": "\nIt\u2019s inevitable that Trump screws things up bad this term. No doubt about it. But I am wondering what exactly do you all think MAGA supporters will say and do once Trump starts to really make things worse for just everyone in general who isnt made of money? Granted this time I doubt there will be another cop out where he mentions the \u201cdeep state\u201d or the \u201cmedia\u201d, or \u201cmarxist/leftist agenda conspiracists\u201d, and even if there was I doubt that message would even work as effectively as it originally did since he literally is in control of the \u201cmedia\u201d and the government with an already predominantly republican led government.\n\nFor the record, I have parents who were originally die hard \u201cTrumpies\u201donce the mail in voting ballots came in. My dad wasn\u2019t budging, but now he seems to be showing disdain for Trumps ways in office right now. My mom refuses to speak politics if she\u2019s proven wrong about what she was originally convinced by my dad and their WhatsApp echo chambers in the first place. I still feel they are both afraid to admit they were wrong and immediately resort to shutting down conversations regarding Trumps policies or any US politics for that matter.",

They do not care about facts, and they do not care about experts, which are the two other types of arguments in that triad.\n\nTry using ChatGPT to teach you how to use the Socratic method to get them to answer their own questions and find their own way out of their mind traps and cognitive dissonance.

What's left is just a cult of personality as well as a clique of opportunistic grifters and political startups who are just trying to stay on his good side to get ahead. \n\nTrump sabotaged his own government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, letting 400,000 people die on his watch, but still managed to increase his vote share in 2020 from 2016 by millions of votes. He's revealed himself to be a prolific liar and fraudster time and time again. Whatever inevitable fuck-up takes place in his 2nd term, Trump supporters and sycophants will just find different excuses and scapegoats to explain away his failures.",
